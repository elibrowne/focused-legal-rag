Potential CURIS project: improving a legal RAG model

A RAG model relies on two mechanisms: retrieval and generation. 
 - This model aims to fine-tune existing retrieval models on legal passages, making them more effective in retrieving meaningful passages to answer legal queries.
 - This model aims to improve the RAG model's use of context to generate responses. Previous research found that even when provided with a gold passage, models were only able to effectively answer questions ~70% of the time: we want this to be much higher!
