0	A dog whistle manufacturer's factory was located near a residential area. The manufacturer used the most effective methods for testing its whistles, but it was impossible to completely soundproof the testing area. A breeder of champion show dogs bought some property near the factory and raised and trained her dogs there. Although the whistles were too high-pitched to be perceived by human ears, they could be heard by the breeder's dogs. Consequently, the dogs often were in a constant state of agitation. In a suit by the breeder against the manufacturer, the breeder will:
1	Sand Company operated an installation for distributing sand and gravel. The installation was adjacent to a residential area. On Sand's grounds there was a chute with polished metal sides for loading sand and gravel into trucks. The trucks being loaded stopped on the public street below the chute. After closing hours, a plywood screen was placed in the chute and the ladder used for inspection was removed to another section of the installation. For several months, however, a number of children, 8 to 10 years of age, had been playing on Sand's property and the adjoining street after closing hours. The children found the ladder and also discovered that they could remove the plywood screen from the chute and slide down to the street below. Sand knew of this activity. One evening, the children were using the chute as a play device. As an automobile driven by Commuter approached the chute, Ladd, an 8-year-old boy, slid down just in front of the automobile. Commuter applied her brakes, but they suddenly failed, and she hit and injured Ladd. Commuter saw the child in time to have avoided hitting him if her brakes had worked properly. Two days previously, Commuter had taken her car to Garage to have her brakes inspected. Garage inspected the brakes and told her that the brakes were in perfect working order. Claims were asserted on behalf of Ladd by his proper legal representative against Sand, Commuter, and Garage. On Ladd's claim against Sand, will Ladd prevail?
2	Rohan executed and delivered a promissory note and a mortgage securing the note to Acme Mortgage Company, which was named as payee in the note and as mortgagee in the mortgage. The note included a statement that the indebtedness evidenced by the note was "subject to the terms of a contract between the maker and the payee of the note executed on the same day" and that the note was "secured by a mortgage of even date." The mortgage was promptly and properly recorded. Subsequently, Acme sold the Rohan note and mortgage to XYZ Bank and delivered to XYZ Bank a written assignment of the Rohan note and mortgage. The assignment was promptly and properly recorded. Acme retained possession of both the note and the mortgage in order to act as collecting agent. Later, being short of funds, Acme sold the note and mortgage to Peterson at a substantial discount. Acme executed a written assignment of the note and mortgage to Peterson and delivered to him the note, the mortgage, and the assignment. Peterson paid value for the assignment without actual knowledge of the prior assignment to XYZ Bank and promptly and properly recorded his assignment. The principal of the note was not then due, and there had been no default in payment of either interest or principal. If the issue of ownership of the Rohan note and mortgage is subsequently raised in an appropriate action by XYZ Bank to foreclose, the court should hold that
3	An ordinance of a city prohibits leafleting on the grounds of any hospital or on the sidewalks within five feet of the hospital entrances during visiting hours. A member of a religious group advocating prayer to restore the sick to good health is arrested for violating the ordinance, is fined $100, and is convicted. She appeals her conviction, claiming that her constitutional rights were violated. The case was heard by the state supreme court, which ruled that while the ordinance was permissible under the United States Constitution, it was unconstitutional under the state constitution because the fine money was designated to go to the city's only hospital, which was privately owned, rather than to the city. The city seeks to bring the case before the United States Supreme Court. Should the United States Supreme Court grant certiorari?
4	The police arrested the defendant and charged him with murder. After the defendant's arrest, two police officers went to his home, where they found his wife. The victim had been killed on the night of March 13, and the officers asked the wife to give them the jacket that the defendant wore on the evening of March 13. Without saying a word, the wife handed the officers a jacket that was covered with bloodstains. Crime lab tests established that the blood on the jacket matched the victim's blood characteristics.'At the defendant's trial for murder, the prosecution seeks to introduce the jacket into evidence. Assuming the prosecution successfully establishes a foundation, if the defense objects to the jacket's admissibility, the court should rule that the jacket is:
5	Acting pursuant to a valid search warrant, the police entered and searched the defendant's garage and discovered a cardboard box containing cocaine in the rafters storage area. The box was securely taped and bore a freight label addressed to the defendant's friend. At his trial for violation of the jurisdiction's statute making it a felony to knowingly possess cocaine, the defendant testified that his friend had brought him the package a week before it was seized by the police, telling him that he needed to store it in the defendant's garage. The defendant also testified that he had not asked the friend what it contained. What additional facts must the prosecution prove to establish the defendant's liability for the charged felony?
6	A seller entered into a contract to sell his land to a buyer for $100,000, with the closing to take place in 30 days. The following week, the seller died in an automobile accident. His will left his personal property to his son and his real property to his sister. At closing, who is entitled to the proceeds of the sale?
7	Poe ordered some merchandise from Store. When the merchandise was delivered, Poe decided that it was not what he had ordered, and he returned it for credit. Store refused to credit Poe's account, continued to bill him, and, after 90 days, turned the account over to Kane, a bill collector, for collection. Kane called at Poe's house at 7 p.m. on a summer evening while many of Poe's neighbors were seated on their porches. When Poe opened the door, Kane, who was standing just outside the door, raised an electrically amplified bullhorn to his mouth. In a voice that could be heard a block away, Kane called Poe a "deadbeat" and asked him when he intended to pay his bill to Store. Poe, greatly angered, slammed the door shut. The door struck the bullhorn and jammed it forcibly against Kane's face. As a consequence, Kane lost his front teeth. If Poe asserts a claim based on intentional infliction of emotional distress against Kane, will Poe prevail?
8	A businessman agreed with an accountant to lease to the accountant a small business computer system. Their oral agreement included that the lease would be for a term of five years, and that the accountant would pay a monthly charge of $500 for the system. The businessman and the accountant further agreed that $200 of the monthly charge would be paid by the accountant directly to a third party, in satisfaction of a debt the businessman owed the third party. The businessman prepared a written copy of the agreement on his computer, but accidentally did not include the agreement that called for the direct payment to the third party in the written copy. The businessman sent the copy of the written agreement, signed by him, to the accountant, who also signed it without noticing that the provision calling for the direct payment to the third party was missing. If the accountant refused to make any payments to the third party, and the latter brings an action against the accountant for damages as a consequence, which of the following, if true, would be most harmful to the third party?
9	A city zoning board recently denied a request from the local library for a variance needed to expand the library building. In order to put pressure on the board to change their vote, a library patron went to the library, stood next to the front door, and handed each person entering the library a leaflet asking the person to contact each city zoning board member named in the leaflet and threaten to vote each member out of office unless the member changed his or her vote regarding the library's request for a zoning variance. The head librarian noticed the patron handing out the leaflets and asked her to stop, correctly explaining that the distribution was in violation of a city ordinance. The patron refused to comply, and the head librarian summoned the police. When an officer arrived, the librarian again asked the patron to stop distributing leaflets, but the patron again refused. The officer then arrested the patron for violating a city ordinance. At trial, the patron defended against the charges by claiming a violation of her First Amendment rights. Which of the following variations of fact would be most helpful to the patron's First Amendment claim?
10	The plaintiff was badly injured in a threecar accident and suffered $100,000 worth of damages. The trier of fact determined that the plaintiff was 30% at fault, the defendant was 30% at fault, and the third driver was 40% at fault. How much can the plaintiff recover from the defendant?
11	Blackacre was a tract of 100 acres retained by Byron, the owner, after he had developed the adjoining 400 acres as a residential subdivision. Byron had effectively imposed restrictive covenants on each lot in the 400 acres. Chaney offered Byron a good price for a five-acre tract located in a corner of Blackacre far away from the existing 400-acre residential subdivision. Byron conveyed the fiveacre tract to Chaney and imposed the same restrictive covenants on the five-acre tract as he had imposed on the lots in the adjoining 400 acres. Byron further covenanted that when he sold the remaining 95 acres of Blackacre he would impose the same restrictive covenants in the deed or deeds for the 95 acres. Byron's conveyance to Chaney was promptly and properly recorded. However, shortly thereafter, Byron conveyed the remaining 95 acres to Dart for $100,000 by a deed that made no mention of any restrictive covenants. Dart had no actual knowledge of the restrictive covenants in Chaney's deed. Dart now proposes to build an industrial park which would violate such restrictive covenants if they are applicable. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides: "No conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value and without notice unless the same be recorded according to law." In an appropriate action by Chaney to enforce the restrictive covenants against Dart's 95-acre tract, if Dart wins it will be because
12	After a bomb explosion in an airport locker, a detective was told by a reliable informant that, three months before, the informant had been in a terrorist's apartment and saw what appeared to be some sticks of dynamite. Reasonably believing that the informant's information established probable cause, the detective prepared an affidavit for a search warrant. After the warrant was issued, the detective and a group of police raided the terrorist's apartment. No evidence connecting the terrorist with the bombing was discovered, but the police did discover several grams of cocaine during the search of the apartment. At his trial for possession of narcotics, the terrorist's motion to suppress the evidence would probably be:
13	House owns his home in City. On the lawn in front of his home and within five feet of the public sidewalk, there was a large tree. The roots of the tree caused the sidewalk to buckle severely and become dangerous. An ordinance of City requires adjacent landowners to keep sidewalks in safe condition. House engaged Contractor to repair the sidewalk, leaving it to Contractor to decide how the repair should be made. Contractor dug up the sidewalk, cut back the roots of the tree, and laid a new sidewalk. Two days after House had paid Contractor the agreed price of the repair, the tree fell over onto the street and damaged a parked car belonging to Driver. Driver has asserted claims against House and Contractor, and both defendants admit that cutting the roots caused the tree to fall. In the claim of Driver against Contractor, the best defense of Contractor is that
14	The defendant discovered that his friend had hit and killed a pedestrian while driving that afternoon, and that he had fled from the scene of the crime before the police arrived. To keep his friend out of trouble, the defendant fixed all the dents in the car caused by the collision and had the vehicle painted a different color. The friend, distraught about hitting and killing someone, eventually turned himself in and told the police what he had done and what the defendant had done for him. The defendant was charged as an accomplice to vehicular manslaughter in a state that follows the modern trend regarding accomplice liability. He should be found:
15	Auto Company. a corporation, was a small dealer in big new cars and operated a service department. Peter wanted to ask Mike, the service manager, whether Auto Company would check the muffler on his small foreign car. Peter parked on the street near the service department with the intention of entering that part of the building by walking through one of the three large entrances designed for use by automobiles. There was no street entrance to the service department for individuals, and customers as well as company employees often used one of the automobile entrances. As Peter reached the building, he glanced behind him to be sure no vehicle was approaching that entrance. Seeing none, he walked through the entrance, but immediately he was struck on the back of the head and neck by the large overhead door which was descending. The blow knocked Peter unconscious and caused permanent damage. Peter did not know how the door was raised and lowered: however, the overhead door was operated by the use of eitherof two switches in the building. One switch was located in the office of the service manager and the other was located near the door in the service work area for the convenience of the mechanics. On this occasion, no one was in the service work area except three Auto Company mechanics. Mike, who had been in his office, and the three mechanics denied having touched a switch that would have lowered the door. Subsequent investigation showed, however, that the switches were working properly and that all of the mechanisms for moving the door were in good working order. If Peter asserts a claim based on negligence against Auto Company, Peter probably will
16	A woman took her car in for scheduled maintenance. The mechanic certified that the car was in perfect working order. Later that day, the woman was driving beyond the posted speed limit when her brakes failed, causing her car to strike a pedestrian. If the pedestrian brings an action against the mechanic who certified the woman's car as operable, what will be the probable outcome?
17	Landco owns and operates a 12-story apartment building containing 72 apartments, 70 of which are rented. Walker has brought an action against Landco alleging that while he was walking along a public sidewalk adjacent to Landco's apartment building a flower pot fell from above and struck him on the shoulder, causing extensive injuries. The action was to recover damages for those injuries. If Walker proves the foregoing facts and offers no other evidence explaining the accident, will his claim survive a motion for directed verdict offered by the defense?
18	A locksmith knew that his friend had been having marital troubles. The friend had told the locksmith that he suspected his wife was having an affair with his rival. One afternoon, the friend, visibly upset, asked to borrow some of the locksmith's tools, telling him that he knew that his rival was going to meet up with his wife later that day. The locksmith gave his friend the tools, advising him not do anything that he would regret later. The friend stated that it would be others who would have regrets. The friend went to his rival's apartment and picked the door lock with the locksmith's tools. He found his wife and rival in bed together. The friend stabbed his rival, seriously wounding him. A few minutes later the locksmith called the apartment to try to warn the rival that his friend might come over. After the friend was arrested, he agreed to plead guilty to aggravated battery and attempted voluntary manslaughter in exchange for testifying against the locksmith, who was charged as an accomplice to attempted murder. Can the locksmith be convicted of that charge?
19	Daniel and a group of his friends are fanatical basketball fans who regularly meet at each others' homes to watch basketball games on television. Some of the group are fans of team A, and others are fans of team B. When the group has watched televised games between these two teams, fights sometimes have broken out among the group. Despite this fact, Daniel invited the group to his home to watch a championship game between teams A and B. During the game, Daniel's guests became rowdy and antagonistic. Fearing that they would begin to fight, and that a fight would damage his possessions, Daniel asked his guests to leave. They refused to go and soon began to fight. Daniel called the police, and Officer was sent to Daniel's home. Officer sustained a broken nose in his efforts to stop the fighting. Officer brought an action against Daniel alleging that Daniel was negligent in inviting the group to his house to watch this championship game. Daniel has moved to dismiss the complaint. The best argument in support of this motion would be that
20	A leading question is LEAST likely to be permitted over objection when
21	A statute of the state of Illitron declares that after five years of continuous service in their positions all state employees, including faculty members at the state university, are entitled to retain their positions during "good behavior." The statute also contains a number of procedural provisions. Any state employee who is dismissed after that five-year period must be given reasons for the dismissal before it takes effect. In addition, such an employee must, upon request, be granted a postdismissal hearing before an administrative board to seek reinstatement and back pay. The statute precludes any other hearing or opportunity to respond to the charges. That post-dismissal hearing must occur within six months after the dismissal takes effect. The burden of proof at such a hearing is on the state, and the board may uphold the dismissal only if it is supported by a preponderance of the evidence. An employee who is dissatisfied with a decision of the board after a hearing may appeal its decision to the state courts. The provisions of this statute are inseverable. A teacher who had been employed continuously for seven years as a faculty member at the state university was dismissed. A week before the dismissal took effect, she was informed that she was being dismissed because of a charge that she accepted a bribe from a student in return for raising the student's final grade in her course. At that time she requested an immediate hearing to contest the propriety of her dismissal. Three months after her dismissal, she was granted a hearing before the state administrative board. The board upheld her dismissal, finding that the charge against her was supported by a preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing. The faculty member did not appeal the decision of the state administrative board to the Illitron state courts. Instead, she sought a declaratory judgment in federal district court to the effect that the state statute prescribing the procedures for her dismissal is unconstitutional. In this case, the federal district court should
22	A woman was stopped at a police roadblock to check for drunk drivers. The police were stopping every third vehicle that came through the checkpoint, and the woman's car turned out to be a third vehicle. After failing a field sobriety test, the woman was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated. Was the stop of the woman's car legal?
23	Congress has enacted a law providing that all disagreements between the United States and a state over federal grant-in-aid funds shall be settled by the filing of a suit in the federal district court in the affected state. The law further provides: "The judgment of the federal court shall be transmitted to the head of the federal agency dispensing such funds, who, if satisfied that the judgment is fair and lawful, shall execute the judgment according to its terms." This law is:
24	A state statute requires that a person who is suspected of committing a crime must be informed of the nature of that crime before questioning may begin. The state supreme court has held that statements obtained in violation of a suspect's statutory rights may not be admitted into evidence. The defendant, who was arrested on suspicion of committing an arson, was told "You have the right to remain silent; anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law; you have the right to the presence of an attorney during questioning; and if you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you." In response to questioning, the defendant gave a statement implicating himself in the arson. He was charged and brought to trial in state court for arson. At trial, should the statement be excluded from evidence?
25	A woman aboard an airplane informed a flight attendant that she had witnessed another passenger stealing several small bottles of alcohol from a serving cart. The flight attendant alerted the airline's private on-board security guard, dressed in plain clothes, who approached the passenger, displayed his gun, and demanded that the passenger step into a service area for further questioning. The accused passenger quickly complied. On further investigation, it was determined that the woman was mistaken, and what she had actually witnessed was another flight attendant from a different section of the plane getting more supplies for a serving cart. If the passenger sues the airline on the theory of assault, he likely will:
26	Owen held in fee simple Farmdale, a large tract of vacant land. The state wherein Farmdale is situated has a statute which provides, in substance, that unless the conveyance is recorded, every deed orother conveyance of an interest in land is void as to a subsequent purchaser who pays value without notice of such conveyance. The following transactions occurred in the order given. First: Owen conveyed Farmdale, for a fair price, to Allred by general warranty deed. Allred did not immediately record. Second: Owen executed a mortgage to secure repayment of a loan concurrently made to Owen by Leon. Leon had no notice of the prior conveyance to Allred and promptly duly recorded the mortgage. Third: Owen, by general warranty deed, gratuitously conveyed to Niece, who promptly duly recorded this deed. Fourth: Allred duly recorded his deed from Owen. Fifth: Niece, by general warranty deed, conveyed Farmdale to Barrett. Barrett had no actual notice of any of the prior transactions, paid full value, and promptly duly recorded the deed. Asserting that his title was held free of any claim by Leon, Allred instituted suit against Leon to quiet title to Farmdale. Judgment should be for
27	Davidson and Smythe were charged with burglary of a warehouse. They were tried separately. At Davidson's trial, Smythe testified that he saw Davidson commit the burglary. While Smythe is still subject to recall as a witness, Davidson calls Smythe's cellmate, Walton, to testify that Smythe said, "I broke into the warehouse alone because Davidson was too drunk to help." This evidence of Smythe's statement is
28	In which of the following situations is Defendant most likely to be guilty of larceny?
29	The key witness in the prosecution's case against the defendant is the only eyewitness to have seen the commission of the felony for which the defendant is being charged. The witness, a recent immigrant, has a total hearing impairment and is mute. In addition, the system of "signing" for the deaf is different in the witness's country of origin from the method used in the United States. The only person in the county conversant with the witness's signing method is a clerk in the county prosecutor's office. The clerk had assisted the police in their questioning of the witness prior to the defendant's arrest, and also when the witness identified the defendant in a lineup. Should the court allow the witness to testify using the clerk as an interpreter?
30	While Defendant was in jail on a procuring charge, his landlord called the police because rent had not been paid and because he detected a disagreeable odor coming from Defendant's apartment into the hallways. The police officer who responded to the call knew that Defendant was in jail. He recognized the stench coming from Defendant's apartment as that of decomposing flesh and, without waiting to obtain a warrant and using the landlord's passkey, entered the apartment with the landlord's consent. The lease to these premises gave the landlord a right of entry, at any reasonable hour, for the purpose of making repairs. The police officer found a large trunk in the bedroom which seemed to be the source of the odor. Upon breaking it open, he found the remains of Rosette, Defendant's former mistress. If Defendant undertakes to challenge the search of his apartment, he has

On Sand's grounds there was a chute with polished metal sides for loading sand and gravel into trucks. The trucks being loaded stopped on the public street below the chute. After closing hours, a plywood screen was placed in the chute and the ladder used for inspection was removed to another section of the installation. For several months, however, a number of children, 8 to 10 years of age, had been playing on Sand's property and the adjoining street after closing hours. The children found the ladder and also discovered that they could remove the plywood screen from the chute and slide down to the street below. Sand knew of this activity. One evening, the children were using the chute as a play device. As an automobile driven by Commuter approached the chute, Ladd, an 8-year-old boy, slid down just in front of the automobile. Commuter applied her brakes, but they suddenly failed, and she hit and injured Ladd. Commuter saw the child in time to have avoided hitting him if her brakes had worked properly. Two days previously, Commuter had taken her car to Garage to have her brakes inspected. Garage inspected the brakes and told her that the brakes were in perfect working order. Claims were asserted on behalf of Ladd by his proper legal representative against Sand, Commuter, and Garage. On Ladd's claim against Commuter, Commuter's best defense is that
32	David built in his backyard a garage that encroached two feet across the property line onto property owned by his neighbor, Prudence. Thereafter, David sold his property to Drake. Prudence was unaware, prior to David's sale to Drake, of the encroachment of the garage onto her property. When she thereafter learned of the encroachment, she sued David for damages for trespass. In this action, will Prudence prevail?
33	Farquart had made a legally binding promise to furnish his son Junior and the latter's fiancee a house on their wedding day, planned for June 10, 1972. Pursuant to that promise, Farquart telephoned his old contractor-friend Sawtooth on May 1, 1971, and made the following oral agreementeach making full and accurate written notes thereof: Sawtooth was to cut 30 trees into fireplace logs from a specified portion of a certain one-acre plot owned by Farquart, and Farquart was to pay therefor S20 per tree. Sawtooth agreed further to build a house ,n the plot conforming to the specifications of Plan OP5 published by Builders, Inc. for a construction price of Sl8,000. Farquart agreed to make payments of $2,000 on the first of every month for nine months beginning August I, 1971, upon monthly presentation of a certificate by Builders. Inc. that the specifications of Plan OP5 were being met. Sawtooth delivered the cut logs to Farquart in July 1971, when he also began building the house. Farquart made three S2.,000 payments forthe work done in July, August, and September 1971, without requiring a certificate. Sawtooth worked through October, but no work was done from November 1, 1971. to the end of February 1972. because of bad weather: and Farquart made no payments during that period. Sawtooth did not object. On March 1, 1972, Sawtooth demanded payment of $2,000 but Farquart refused on the grounds that no construction work had been done for four months and Builders had issued no certificate. Sawtooth thereupon abandoned work and repudiated the agreement. Assuming that Sawtooth committed a total breach on March 1, 1972, and assuming further that he was aware when the agreement was made of the purpose for which Farquart wanted the completed house, which of the following, if true, would best support Farquart's claim for consequential damages on account of delay beyond June 10, 1972, in getting the house finished'?
34	Furrow leased in writing a 100-acre farm from Quark for five years at $2,000 per year, with an option to purchase "five acres of the land for $10,000 cash" at the end of the lease term. Before the lease was executed, Quark orally promised to have a five-acre parcel surveyed before the end of the lease term. Furrow took possession of the farm and paid the rent for five years. During the fifth year, having decided that he would exercise the purchase option, Furrow planted several fruit trees and built a large grain silo on the property. At the end of the term, Furrow tendered Quark $10,000 and demanded a conveyance, but Quark repudiated the option agreement and retook possession of the farm. He had never had the five-acre parcel surveyed. Assume for this question only that Quark is not liable to Furrow for breach of a land-sale contract. In an action by Furrow against Quark for the reasonable value of the improvements that Furrow added to the farm, which of the following theories would best support Furrow's claim?
35	A plaintiff sued a defendant for negligence when the tractor that he was driving at a construction site collided with the plaintiff's car. The plaintiff alleged that she was driving in a proper lane when the tractor collided with her car. The plaintiff's counsel called the responding police officer to testify that the defendant's employee made a statement to the police officer, in the defendant's presence, that the defendant "accidentally went too far into traffic," and the defendant did not say anything. The trial judge should rule that this evidence is:
36	A utility company working underground installed a guardrail around its access hole for safety. Although the guardrail completely surrounded the hole, there was an opening in one part of the rail to make it easier to pass down tools to those working below. The owner of a show dog living across the street from the utility access hole frequently walked his dog in his front yard without a leash. One afternoon, the dog unexpectedly chased a squirrel out of the dog owner's yard and ran through the opening of the guardrail, falling into the open hole and suffering broken bones and internal injuries. Although expert veterinary care saved the dog's life, the dog was no longer of "show quality" after the injuries. The dog owner brought a negligence claim against the utility company to recover his economic losses resulting from the injuries to his dog. At trial, the dog owner presented the above facts. The utility company presented uncontested evidence that the guardrail used by the company meets typical industry standards, and that the opening in the guardrail was not large enough for a person to have fallen through. At the close of the evidence, the utility company moved for a directed verdict.
37	A new college graduate entered into an oral agreement with a freshman to lease the freshman her mini-refrigerator for a term of four years. The freshman was to pay the graduate $20 a month, of which $10 of the monthly charge was to be paid directly to the graduate's parents, in satisfaction of a debt the graduate owed her parents. While the graduate was putting the agreement into writing she accidentally did not include the agreement to pay her parents directly. The freshman also failed to notice that the direct payment provision was missing before she signed the contract, which the graduate signed. If the parents bring an action against the freshman, which of the following will have the greatest effect on the outcome?
38	Paulsen was eating in a restaurant when he began to choke on a piece of food that had lodged in his throat. Dow, a physician who was sitting at a nearby table, did not wish to become involved and did not render any assistance, although prompt medical attention would have been effective in removing the obstruction from Paulsen's throat. Because of the failure to obtain prompt medical attention, Paulsen suffered severe brain injury from lack of oxygen. If Paulsen asserts a claim against Dow for his injuries, will Paulsen prevail?
39	While negligently driving his father's uninsured automobile, 25-year-old Arthur crashed into an automobile driven by Betty. Both Arthur and Betty were injured. Charles, Arthur's father, erroneously believing that he was liable because he owned the automobile, said to Betty: "I will see to it that you are reimbursed for any losses you incur as a result of the accident." Charles also called Physician and told him to take care of Betty, and that he, Charles, would pay the bill. Arthur, having no assets, died as a result of his injuries. Dodge, one of Arthur's creditors, wrote to Charles stating that Arthur owed him a clothing bill of $200 and that he was going to file a claim against Arthur's estate. Charles replied: "If you don't file a claim against Arthur's estate, I will pay what he owed you." If Physician discontinued treating Betty before she had fully recovered and Betty brought an action against Physician for breach of contract, which of the following arguments, if any, by Physician would probably be effective in defense? I. Betty furnished no consideration, either express or implied. II. Physician's contract was with Charles and not with Betty. III. Whatever contract Physician may have had with Betty was discharged by novation on account of the agreement with Charles.
40	Congress enacted a statute imposing an additional 2% national retail sales tax on all goods sold in the United States. The purpose of the tax was to fund unemployment payments during the recession. An association of newspaper and book publishers sued to remove the tax from newspaper and book publications, claiming that the tax placed an unconstitutional burden on the freedom of speech and press. Assuming that the association has standing, it:
41	Alice entered into a contract with Paul by the terms of which Paul was to paint Alice's office for $1,000 and was required to do all of the work over the following weekend so as to avoid disruption of Alice's business. For this question only, assume the following facts. If Paul had started to paint on the following Saturday morning, he could have finished before Sunday evening. However, he stayed home that Saturday morning to watch the final game of the World Series on TV, and did not start to paint until Saturday afternoon. By late Saturday afternoon, Paul realized that he had underestimated the time it would take to finish the job if he continued to work alone. Paul phoned Alice at her home and accurately informed her that it was impossible to finish the work over the weekend unless he hired a helper. He also stated that to do so would require an additional charge of $200 for the work. Alice told Paul that she apparently had no choice but to pay "whatever it takes" to get the work done as scheduled. Paul hired Ted to help finish the painting and paid Ted $200. Alice has offered to pay Paul $1,000. Paul is demanding $1,200. How much is Paul likely to recover?
42	Defendant was tried for robbery. Victim Worth were the only witnesses called to.t tify. Victim testified that Defend; threatened her with a knife, grabbed her pur and ran off with it.

43	Company designed and built a processing plant for the manufacture of an explosive chemical. Engineer was retained by Company to design a filter system for the processing plant. She prepared an application for a permit to build the plant's filter system and submitted it to the state's Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). As required by DEP regulations, Engineer submitted a blueprint to the DEP with the application for permit. The blueprint showed the entire facility and was signed and sealed by her as a licensed professional engineer. After the project was completed, a portion of the processing plant exploded, injuring Plaintiff. During discovery in an action by Plaintiff against Engineer, it was established that the explosion was caused by a design defect in the processing plant that was unrelated to the filter system designed by Engineer. In that action, will Plaintiff prevail?
44	A state suffering from a severe loss of tax revenues, due to an initiative that cut state sales taxes in half, enacted legislation that ended cost-of-living increases in all state employees' pensions. A state organization of employees brought suit against the appropriate state official in the federal court to reinstate the increase. The most likely result will be that:
45	A man was arrested in a state for armed robbery. A combined preliminary hearing to determine probable cause and initial appearance was held within 20 hours of his arrest. Probable cause was found, and bail was properly denied under the state's Bail Reform Act. A state statute provided that when a defendant is in custody, his trial must begin within 50 days of his arrest. After 50 days had passed since the man's arrest and no trial had been held, he filed a motion for dismissal for violation of his right to a speedy trial under the state constitution, which tracked verbatim the speedy trial provision of the United States Constitution. The trial judge held that he was bound to follow federal interpretations of the speedy trial provision and granted the man's motion on that basis. On appeal, the state supreme court agreed with the trial judge. The state prosecutor seeks to challenge the ruling in the United States Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court thinks that the state court wrongly decided that the man was denied his right to a speedy trial under federal standards, it should:
46	A brother and sister, Bruce and Sharon, acquired as joint tenants a twenty-acre parcel of land called Greenacre. They contributed equally to the purchase price. Several years later, Bruce proposed that they build an apartment development on Greenacre. Sharon rejected the proposal but orally agreed with Bruce that Bruce could go ahead on his own on the northerly half of Greenacre and Sharon could do what she wished with the southerly half of Greenacre. Bruce proceeded to build an apartment development on, and generally developed and improved, the northerly ten acres of Greenacre. Sharon orally permitted the southerly ten acres of Greenacre to be used by the Audubon Society as a nature preserve. Bruce died, leaving his entire estate to his son, Stanley. The will named Sharon as executrix of his will, but she refused so to serve. In an appropriate action to determine the respective interests of Sharon and Stanley in Greenacre, if Stanley is adjudged to be the owner of the northerly ten acres of Greenacre, the most likely reason for the judgment will be that
47	Buyer mailed a signed order to Seller that read: "Please ship us 10,000 widgets at your current price." Seller received the order on January 7 and that same day mailed to Buyer a properly stamped, addressed, and signed letter stating that the order was accepted at Seller's current price of $10 per widget. On January 8, before receipt of Seller's letter, Buyer telephoned Seller and said, "I hereby revoke my order." Seller protested to no avail. Buyer received Seller's letter on January 9. Because of Buyer's January 8 telephone message, Seller never shipped the goods. Under the relevant and prevailing rules, is there a contract between Buyer and Seller as of January 10?
48	The State of Yuma provides by statute, ''No person may be awarded any state construction contract without agreeing to employ only citizens of the state and of the United States in performance of the contract.' In evaluating the constitutionality of this state statute under the supremacy clause, which of the following would be most directly relevant?
49	A statute in a jurisdiction makes it a crime to sell ammunition to a minor (defined as a person under the age of eighteen). The courts have interpreted this statute as creating a strict liability offense that does not require knowledge of the age of the purchaser and as creating vicarious liability. Duncan, who was sixteen years old, but looked four or five years older, entered a store owned by Matthews and asked a clerk for a box of .22 caliber shells. Matthews had instructed her employees not to sell ammunition to minors. The clerk asked Duncan his age. Duncan said he was twenty. The clerk then placed a box of shells on the counter and asked, "Anything else?" Duncan said that was all he wanted but then discovered he did not have enough money to pay for the shells, so the clerk put the box back onto the shelf. If Matthews, the owner of the store, is charged with attempting to violate the statute, her best argument would be that
50	To protect the minor children living in the area, a town council enacted an ordinance that prohibited advertisements that include a depiction of a nude person, whether male or female. The owner of a local video rental shop often posts large posters to advertise movies he has available for rent. A substantial part of his business consists of the rental of adult movies, which are kept in a separate part of the shop. In the adult room he hangs movie advertisements, many of them depicting nude or partially nude people. He does not allow minors to enter the adult room. If the owner challenges enforcement of the ordinance against him, how will the court most likely rule?
51	A high school graduate was asked by his elderly aunt to live with her in her large brownstone and attend to the household activities for the rest of her life, in exchange for the house. The graduate agreed, and moved from his parents' home to the brownstone. For eight years, he attended to his aunt's personal needs, and maintained the household. No further discussion was ever had between the graduate and his aunt regarding conveyance of the brownstone. Shortly after his aunt died, the graduate was contacted by the aunt's estranged daughter, who stated that in the aunt's last will and testament, she had devised the house to her. When the graduate refused to vacate the brownstone, the daughter brought action for possession of the house. If the graduate prevails in the action, it will be because:
52	A car owner was having problems with her car's brakes. The brake shop to which she brought her car told her that the entire hydraulic brake system needed to be replaced at a cost of $1,800. The car owner agreed to have the work performed, and the shop replaced the brake system. When the car owner picked up the car, she insisted on testing the brakes before paying for the work. During a test drive, the brakes squeaked when compressed but otherwise worked perfectly. The mechanic told the car owner that the squeak would disappear on its own in a few days. The car owner stated that she would pay the shop when the squeak disappeared and left with her car. A month later, the brakes still squeaked and the car owner refused to pay for the work. The shop files suit to collect the $1,800 contract price.
53	A steelmaker purchased a tube rolling machine from a manufacturer of heavy machinery. The machine was sold unassembled for a price of $150,000, with $25,000 payable on delivery and the balance ($125,000) to be paid in 10 monthly installments of $12,500 each. After the machine parts were delivered, the steelmaker contacted an assembly company that specialized in assembly and installation of large and complex manufacturing machinery, and told the company that the machinery had to be up and running within 45 days, or the steelmaker would be in breach of a major contract that it relied on for much of its current revenue. The company agreed, in a written contract with the steelmaker, to assemble and install the tube rolling machine within 45 days at a price of $15,000. Two weeks later, the manufacturer that sold the tube rolling machine to the steelmaker learned that the assembly company was planning to stop work, due to a strike by its labor union. The manufacturer orally offered the assembly company a $3,500 bonus if it would agree to finish the job for the steelmaker. The company accepted the manufacturer's promise and completed the assembly and installation of the tube rolling machine with supervisory personnel within the 45-day time limit set in the agreement between the company and the steelmaker. However, the manufacturer refused to pay the assembly company the $3,500 bonus, so the company sued the manufacturer. Which of the following would be the assembly company's strongest argument to prevail?
54	A general contractor advertised in a trade publication that she planned to bid on the construction of a new building. The advertisement welcomed bids from subcontractors to perform various functions, such as plumbing, electrical work, and masonry. The lowest plumbing bid she received was from a plumber for $10,000. The general contractor used that bid in preparing her bid and submitted the bid to the client. Shortly thereafter, the plumber called her and explained that there was a mistake in his bid and he could not perform the work for less than $12,000. The general contractor was awarded the contract and told the plumber she was accepting his $10,000 bid, but the plumber reiterated that he would not do the work for less than $12,000. The general contractor hired a different company to do the plumbing work on the building at a cost of $12,000. She now sues the plumber for damages. She is entitled to recover:
55	The defendant planned to break into a home, steal any valuables that he could easily pawn, and then burn down the home using gasoline from his lawnmower. When the defendant got to the home that night, he realized that he had forgotten the gas at home. Nonetheless, the defendant broke into the home through a basement window. Unbeknownst to him, the police were alerted by a silent alarm and arrested the defendant just as he was leaving the home with a sack filled with valuables. At common law, the defendant has committed:
56	An entrepreneur entered into a written leaseoption to purchase an office building. The option to purchase the building could be exercised at any time during the five-year term of the lease by giving the building's owner a written 30-day notice of the intent to exercise the option. A few months later, the entrepreneur assigned his leaseoption to a dentist looking for office space by written agreement. If the dentist fully performs under the lease, can the dentist exercise the option to purchase that was given to the entrepreneur?
57	A blacksmith ran a small forge in a tourist attraction depicting village life in the 1800s, and produced small metal trinkets for sale as souvenirs. A tourist came into the forge and started ridiculing the blacksmith, telling him that he was foolish for practicing such an out-of-date trade when modern equipment could produce the same trinkets faster and far more cheaply. Although he maintained a calm demeanor, the blacksmith was enraged by the time the customer finished and headed back out the door. He picked up an anvil and hurled it in the general direction of the customer. The anvil fell harmlessly to the ground after traveling maybe a foot. If the blacksmith is charged with assault, which of the following statements would be most helpful for his defense:
58	In Polk's negligence action against Dell arising out of a multiple-car collision, Witt testified for Polk that Dell went through a red light. On crossexamination, Dell seeks to question Witt about her statement that the light was yellow, made in a deposition that Witt gave in a separate action between Adams and Baker. The transcript of the deposition is self-authenticating. On proper objection, the court should rule the inquiry
59	The owner of a semi-pro baseball team offered a former player a position as the team's manager. During negotiations, the owner agreed to pay the manager $300 per week, but insisted that if the manager quit during the season, he would have to pay a "penalty" of $200 per week for each week that he did not manage the team, because it would cost the owner several hundred dollars to replace him during the season. The parties agreed in writing to those terms. The manager managed the team for 14 weeks with only mixed success. Nevertheless, with 10 weeks left in the season, he was offered and accepted a job as manager of a professional baseball team. Fortunately for the owner of the semi-pro team, the manager's replacement had great success with the team, causing attendance to skyrocket. If the owner of the semi-pro team brings suit against the manager to recover $2,000, the amount due under the "penalty" provision, the owner will:
60	While Hill was in her kitchen, she heard the screech of automobile tires. She ran to the window and saw a tricycle flying through the air. The tricycle had been hit by a car driven by Weber, who had been speeding. She also saw a child's body in the grass adjacent to the street. As a result of her shock from this experience, Hill suffered a heart attack. In a claim by Hill against Weber, the issue on which Hill's right to recover will depend is whether
61	A man who lived in the state of Green was injured when the automobile that he was driving crossed over the yellow line and crashed into an automobile being driven by a woman in the state of Green. The woman was a domiciliary of the state of Orange. The man suffered severe injuries in the crash and his automobile was totally destroyed. The woman's automobile was severely damaged, but she received only minor cuts and bruises as a result of the crash. At the time of the crash, the man was legally intoxicated. The woman brought suit against the man in a proper Green state court to recover $20,000 for the damages to her car. The man filed a counterclaim against the woman for $400,000 for his personal injuries and damages to his automobile. The state of Green has adopted a pure comparative negligence rule. The court found that the man was 90% at fault and the woman was 10% at fault and entered a final judgment against the woman for $22,000 after offsetting her damages against the man's damages. The man then filed suit in the state of Orange to enforce his judgment against the woman. The state of Orange has adopted partial comparative negligence by statute. The woman appeared at the state of Orange proceeding and argued that the Green judgment should not be enforced because the state of Orange has a strong public policy against both drunk driving and allowing a tortfeasor who was more than 50% at fault from recovering from someone who was less than 50% at fault. How should the Orange state court rule?
62	A man was approached by his cousin, who planned to rob a bank, to act as the escape driver. The man pretended to agree, and he planned to report his cousin to the police before the crime was committed. On the day appointed for the crime, the man picked up his cousin and drove him to the bank, and they stopped at a convenience store on the way. He left the car running with his cousin inside and from the store he called the police to warn that a bank robbery was about to occur. The police officer answering the phone thought it was a prank call and hung up. After another unsuccessful attempt the man went back to the car to talk his cousin out of the bank robbery, but he found the car missing. The cousin had grown nervous after a few minutes, driven to the bank, and robbed it at gunpoint. He fled the scene, but was apprehended soon thereafter. If the man is charged with conspiracy, the trial court is most likely to find him:
63	A landowner conveyed her parcel of land to "my brother and my sister jointly, with right of survivorship." Shortly thereafter, the brother was in an automobile accident. The driver of the other vehicle sued the brother on a theory of negligence, and obtained a judgment in the amount of $250,000. Because the brother did not have insurance or enough cash to satisfy the judgment, the driver levied on the brother's interest in the land. The driver will get:
64	The defendant and the victim, both of whom were drinking, got into a heated exchange of words in a bar. After several minutes, both calmed down and continued drinking. When the victim started to stagger out of the bar after several more hours, the defendant yelled an insult directed at the victim and picked up a chair as if he were going to strike the victim. However, the defendant immediately dropped the chair when the victim turned around. The defendant was charged with assault, and defends on the basis that he was so intoxicated at the time that he did not realize what he was doing. Which of the following would be least helpful to this defense?
65	A suspect was arrested for burglarizing an apartment. He was duly given Miranda warnings, and invoked his right to remain silent. When the suspect was put into the lockup, the police took from him his wallet, watch, and other personal possessions. Following standard procedure, a police officer immediately began to make an inventory of the suspect's personal effects. During the course of the inventory, the officer noticed that the suspect's watch bore an inscription with the name of a person whose apartment had been burglarized two days earlier. The officer concluded that the suspect had probably burglarized that apartment as well as the one for which he was arrested. She reported the inscription on the watch to the detective who had arrested the suspect, and the suspect was subsequently charged with the earlier burglary as well. Did the officer violate the suspect's constitutional rights by reading the inscription?
66	Dean was prosecuted in federal court for making threats against the President of the United States. Dean was a voluntary patient in a private psychiatric hospital and told a nurse, shortly before the President came to town, that Dean planned to shoot the President. The nurse reported the threat to FBI agents. Dean's motion to prevent the nurse from testifying is likely to be
67	For this question only, assume that no other correspondence passed between Stationer and Lawyer until the following April 15 (four months later), when Stationer received from Lawyer a faxed order for "100 reams of your paper, catalog item #101." Did Lawyer's April 15 fax constitute an effective acceptance of Stationer's offer at the prices specified in the catalog?
68	Gasco owns a storage facility where flammable gases are stored in liquefied form under high pressure in large spherical tanks. The facility was constructed for Gasco by Acme Company, a firm that specializes in the construction of such facilities. After the facility had been in use for five years, an explosion in the facility started a large fire that blanketed the surrounding countryside with a high concentration of oily smoke and soot. Farber owns a large truck farm near the facility. His entire lettuce crop was destroyed by oily deposits left by the smoke. Johnson, who lives near the facility, inhaled a large amount of the smoke and thereafter became obsessed by a fear that the inhalation would destroy his health and ultimately cause his death. If Farber asserts a claim against Acme Company for the loss of his lettuce crop will Farber prevail?
69	While Driver was taking a leisurely spring drive, he momentarily took his eyes off the road to look at some colorful trees in bloom. As a result, his car swerved a few feet off the roadway, directly toward Walker, who was standing on the shoulder of the road waiting for a chance to cross. When Walker saw the car bearing down on him, he jumped backwards, fell, and injured his knee. Walker sued Driver for damages, and Driver moved for summary judgment. The foregoing facts are undisputed. Driver's motion should be
70	A psychotherapist group hired a construction company to construct a one-story building for $700,000 to use as the group's offices. The contract provided that the group would pay one-third of the contract price (i.e., $233,333) on completion of the foundation, another one-third ($233,333) on completion of the walls and roof, and the balance ($233,334) when the rooms were customized for group and private sessions. After completing work on the foundation, the construction company abandoned the project. The group hired another contractor to complete the building. The construction company can recover:
71	Farquart had made a legally binding promise to furnish his son Junior and the latter's fiancee a house on their wedding day, planned for June 10, 1972. Pursuant to that promise, Farquart telephoned his old contractor-friend Sawtooth on May 1, 1971, and made the following oral agreementeach making full and accurate written notes thereof: Sawtooth was to cut 30 trees into fireplace logs from a specified portion of a certain one-acre plot owned by Farquart, and Farquart was to pay therefor S20 per tree. Sawtooth agreed further to build a house ,n the plot conforming to the specifications of Plan OP5 published by Builders, Inc. for a construction price of Sl8,000. Farquart agreed to make payments of $2,000 on the first of every month for nine months beginning August I, 1971, upon monthly presentation of a certificate by Builders. Inc. that the specifications of Plan OP5 were being met. Sawtooth delivered the cut logs to Farquart in July 1971, when he also began building the house. Farquart made three S2.,000 payments forthe work done in July, August, and September 1971, without requiring a certificate. Sawtooth worked through October, but no work was done from November 1, 1971. to the end of February 1972. because of bad weather: and Farquart made no payments during that period. Sawtooth did not object. On March 1, 1972, Sawtooth demanded payment of $2,000 but Farquart refused on the grounds that no construction work had been done for four months and Builders had issued no certificate. Sawtooth thereupon abandoned work and repudiated the agreement. Assuming that Sawtooth committed a total breach on March 1. 1972, what would be the probable measure of Far-quart's damages in an action against Sawtooth for breach of contract?
72	A corporation was in the business of purchasing real property at below-market prices and reselling the properties to investors. The bylaws of the corporation authorized the chief executive officer ("CEO") and the director of the marketing division to enter into contracts on behalf of the corporation for the purchase or sale of properties. The corporation had recently purchased a large parcel of beachfront property for resale. The CEO secretly opened negotiations with an amusement park to sell the property. However, unknown to the CEO or anyone else in the corporation, the marketing director had already reached an agreement with a hotel for the sale of the property. On April 23, the marketing director and the hotel signed a written contract providing for sale of the property by the corporation to the hotel for $35 million. On April 25, the board of directors amended its bylaws, effectively depriving the marketing director of authorization to bind the corporation in purchase or sale transactions. This action was immediately publicized and became known to both the marketing director and the hotel. On April 26, the hotel duly recorded its contract. On May 1, the CEO, still unaware of the marketing director-hotel agreement, approved sale of the property to the amusement park for $39 million. The necessary documents of title were prepared and properly recorded by the amusement park on May 5. Two days later, the amusement park learned of the marketing director-hotel agreement. On May 10, the date scheduled for closing of the hotel's sale agreement, the CEO refused to accept the hotel's tender of $35 million and refused its demand for a deed to the property. In a subsequent action by the hotel against the corporation and the amusement park for specific performance of the contract signed by the marketing director and to quiet title to the property, judgment will likely be for:
73	A federal statute designed to stop organized crime enumerated certain activities as crimes and provided that, in addition to charging these activities as the crimes they constitute, the activities would also constitute the criminal act of intentional furtherance of the goals of organized crime. Among the enumerated activities was the interstate distribution of cocaine. The statute's constitutionality has been upheld by the Supreme Court. The defendant was arrested by federal agents after having driven a truck containing cocaine from Florida to Illinois, where he delivered his illicit cargo as directed. At trial, the defendant is convicted of interstate distribution of cocaine in violation of federal law, and convicted of a violation of the federal statute above. The defendant may be sentenced:
74	A large delivery truck collided with a car. At the time of the accident, the driver of the truck said to the car driver, "The accident was my fault; I wasn't paying any attention. Don't worry, my company will make it right." The delivery company had not authorized the truck driver to make that statement. The subsequent investigation of the accident by the delivery company revealed that the truck driver had been drinking on the day of the accident. He was fired. The car driver brings an appropriate action against the delivery company for damages resulting from the accident. The truck driver has disappeared. The car driver now seeks to testify as to what the truck driver said at the time of the accident. The evidence is:
75	Owner and his employee, Driver, consult Attorney about a motor vehicle collision resulting in a suit by Litigant against Owner and Driver as joint defendants. Attorney calls Irving, his investigator, into the conference to make notes of what is said, and those present discuss the facts of the collision and Owner's insurance. Owner thereafter files a cross-claim against Driver for indemnity for any damages obtained by Litigant. Driver calls Irving in his defense against the cross-claim. He seeks to have Irving testify to admissions made by Owner in the conference. On objection by Owner, the court should rule Irving's testimony
76	Park sued Officer Dinet for false arrest. Dinet's defense was that, based on a description he heard over the police radio, he reasonably believed Park was an armed robber. Police radio dispatcher Brigg, reading from a note, had broadcast the description of an armed robber on which Dinet claims to have relied. The defendant offers the following items of evidence: I. Dinet's testimony relating the description he heard. II. Brigg's testimony relating the description he read over the radio. III. The note containing the description Brigg testifies he read over the radio. Which of the following are admissible on the issue of what description Dinet heard?
77	A landowner devised her campground in her will "to my niece, her heirs, and assigns, so long as it is used for camping and recreational purposes; if used for any other purpose during her lifetime, then to the Girl Scouts of America." Subsequently, the landowner died. The residuary clause of her will left all property not devised in the remainder of the will to her daughter and sole heir. Soon thereafter, the daughter died intestate, her only heir being her son. Last month, the niece entered into a contract to sell the campground to a buyer for its reasonable market value. After the buyer received the title report called for in the contract, he refused to proceed with the purchase, claiming that the niece could not convey good title. The niece, the Girl Scouts of America, and the buyer then execute a new contract calling for the former two parties to sell the property at the same price to the latter. The jurisdiction follows the common law Rule Against Perpetuities, and a statute provides that future estates and interests are alienable, and may be devised or inherited, all in the same manner as possessory estates or interests. Should the buyer proceed with the new purchase transaction?
78	A patient was late for an appointment with her doctor across town. Because of this, she was driving recklessly through traffic at a high speed and ran through a red light. There were a number of people crossing the street at the time, and the patient accidentally hit one of them. The person she hit was seriously injured and was rushed to the hospital, but recovered. The patient was arrested and charged with attempted murder. The patient should be:
79	A new federal law prohibited the use of various pesticides in areas with a certain population density near navigable waters. A city located in the southeastern United States was plagued by a sharp increase in disease-carrying mosquitoes. The city's board of health recommended that all residential areas be sprayed with a pesticide proven to be highly effective against mosquitoes. Despite the fact that the federal law would prohibit use of that pesticide in these areas, the city council passed an ordinance adopting the board of health plan, relying on the opinions of several independent experts that the health benefits of reducing the mosquito population outweighed the risks of spraying. An environmentally minded citizen of the city brought an action in federal court challenging the ordinance. Assuming that the citizen has standing, the court will most likely find the ordinance:
80	Paul, the Plaintiff in a personal injury action, called Wes as a witness to testify that Dan's car, in which Paul had been riding. ran a red light. Wes, however, testified that Dan's car did not run the light. Paul then called Vic to testify that Dan's car did run the light. The trial judge should rule that Vic's testimony is
81	A plaintiff sued an elevator company for injuries he suffered when his foot caught in one of its moving walkways. The company's chief engineer prepared a report of the accident at the request of its insurance company, and the report was given to the attorney who was hired to represent the elevator company in this trial. As part of its case-in-chief, the company's attorney seeks to introduce the report into evidence, and states that its expert witness relied on it. The report states that the walkway was in good mechanical condition at the time of the plaintiff's injury. The plaintiff's attorney objects. The report is:
82	A shoe manufacturer entered into a contract to purchase all cowhide refined by a tannery for the next five years at a price set at 95% of the domestic market price at the time of delivery. The shoe manufacturer agreed to purchase no less than 500 pounds of cowhide a week. At the time this contract was signed, the shoe manufacturer gave written notice to the tannery that it intended to buy all cowhide produced by the tannery until further notice. For the first year, the shoe manufacturer continued to purchase all cowhide produced by the tannery. However, by the end of that year, the tannery doubled its production of cowhide. At a meeting between the tannery and the shoe manufacturer, the tannery's president noted that the shoe manufacturer was getting as much cowhide as it needed, and that the tannery intended to sell the extra cowhide it was producing on foreign markets at a higher price than the shoe manufacturer was paying. The shoe manufacturer agreed to maintain its purchases at the first year's level and signed an addendum to the original agreement reflecting this change. The modification of this contract made by the addendum was:
83	A package delivery service that operates throughout the United States is based in a southwestern state. The company specializes in transporting packages to airports, where air freight companies or commercial airlines transport the packages to their cities of destination. However, the company's entire fleet of trucks operate only in the state in which it is based. The company purchased the trucks from dealers within the state. The company's drivers pick up packages from shippers within the state and the packages are then delivered to an airport located in the state, where employees of the airlines load the packages onto their planes. Each shipper is charged a service fee by the company. The state wishes to impose a 5% transaction tax on each of the fees collected by the company for the services that the company renders in the state. The federal courts would probably rule that such a tax is:
84	On November 1, Debbit, an accountant, and Barrister, a lawyer, contracted for the sale by Debbit to Barrister of the law books Debbit had inherited from his father. Barrister agreed to pay the purchase price of $10,000 when Debbit delivered the books on December 1. On November 10, Barrister received a signed letter from Debbit that stated: "I have decided to dispose of the book stacks containing the law books you have already purchased. If you want the stacks, I will deliver them to you along with the books on December 1 at no additional cost to you. Let me know before November 15 whether you want them. I will not sell them to anyone else before then." On November 14, Barrister faxed and Debbit received the following message: "I accept your offer of the stacks." Debbit was not a merchant with respect to either law books or book stacks. For this question only, assume that on November 12 Debbit told Barrister that he had decided not to part with the stacks. Will this communication operate as a legally effective revocation of his offer to deliver the stacks?
85	Alex and Betty, who were cousins, acquired title in fee simple to Blackacre, as equal tenants in common, by inheritance from Angela, their aunt. During the last 15 years of her lifetime, Angela allowed Alex to occupy an apartment in the house on Blackacre, to rent the other apartment in the house to various tenants, and to retain the rent. Alex made no payments to Angela; and since Angela's death 7 years ago, he has made no payments to Betty. For those 22 years, Alex has paid the real estate taxes on Blackacre, kept the building on Blackacre insured, and maintained the building. At all times, Betty has lived in a distant city and has never had anything to do with Angela, Alex, or Blackacre. Recently, Betty needed money for the operation of her business and demanded that Alex join her in selling Blackacre. Alex refused. The period of time to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is 10 years. There is no other applicable statute. Betty brought an appropriate action against Alex for partition. Alex asserted all available defenses and counterclaims. In that action, the court should
86	Two police officers noticed a car was weaving and generally being driven in an erratic manner. They pursued the vehicle and curbed it. When the driver emerged from the car, he was obviously intoxicated. The officers arrested him and put the driver in their squad car to take him to the station house. The driver's wife was in the passenger seat, and she followed the police in the car to the local precinct. As the driver was being booked, one officer took a standard police inventory sheet and began searching the car. Beneath the passenger seat he found the passenger's purse. He opened the purse and found a plastic zip-lock bag containing a small amount of marijuana. The passenger was charged with possession of marijuana. Prior to trial, her attorney moved to suppress the admission of the marijuana seized from the passenger's purse into evidence. Should the court rule favorably on the motion?
87	The legislature of State X enacts a statute that it believes reconciles the state's interest in the preservation of human life with a woman's right to reproductive choice. That statute permits a woman to have an abortion on demand during the first trimester of pregnancy but prohibits a woman from having an abortion after that time unless her physician determines that the abortion is necessary to protect the woman's life or health. If challenged on constitutional grounds in an appropriate court, this statute will probably be held
88	A man who belonged to an ancient religion whose rituals require the use of bald eagle feathers traveled to an area where bald eagles were known to roost. After searching the area, he found a fallen eagle feather and returned home. A few weeks later, the man showed the feather to an acquaintance, who happened to be a national park ranger, and explained how the feather was obtained. The ranger informed the man that a federal anti-poaching law makes any possession of a bald eagle feather without a special permit a crime. The ranger then cited the man for possession of the feather and confiscated it. At the man's trial for violating the federal bald eagle feather possession statute, which of the following constitutional arguments is most appropriate for the prosecution to make?
89	An artist was adept at copying the paintings of famous artists. In need of money, he made a copy of a painting by a recently deceased artist, complete with her signature. The artist then contacted an art collector and asked whether he would be interested in purchasing this "recovered" painting. The art collector examined the painting and, still believing it to be an original, offered the artist $1 million for it, which the artist eagerly accepted. The art collector gave the artist a check and left with the painting. The artist promptly deposited the check, which cleared several days later. At common law, the artist is guilty of:
90	A bottler markets water in lightweight plastic bottles that are sold by grocery stores, sporting goods stores, and other retail outlets. A hiker purchased several bottles of the water from a retailer and took them with him on a hike. While the hiker left his backpack unattended, a thief took one of the unopened containers without permission and drank some of the water. He immediately became violently ill. Tests were run on the water and showed that it contained impurities. If the thief maintains a negligence action against the bottler, which of the following arguments would be the most helpful to the bottler in avoiding liability?
91	Small retailers located in the state of Yellow are concerned about the loss of business to certain large retailers located nearby in bordering states. In an effort to deal with this concern, the legislature of Yellow enacted a statute requiring all manufacturers and wholesalers who sell goods to retailers in Yellow to do so at prices that are no higher than the lowest prices at which they sell them to retailers in any of the states that border Yellow. Several manufacturers and wholesalers who are located in states bordering Yellow and who sell their goods to retailers in those states and in Yellow bring an action in federal court to challenge the constitutionality of this statute. Which of the following arguments offered by these plaintiffs is likely to be most persuasive in light of applicable precedent? The state statute
92	A neighborhood handyman did some work over the summer for an elderly homeowner who lived down the street. When the work was completed, the handyman sent the homeowner a bill for $500, the price they had agreed to. The homeowner told the handyman that he did not have the money but would make the necessary arrangements to pay him. After the homeowner talked to his brother-in-law, who owed him $500, and extracted a promise from the brotherin-law that he would pay the handyman, the homeowner told the handyman to expect a $500 check from his brother-in-law withintthe week. In a conference call on the telephone, the handyman expressly agreed with the brother-inlaw and the homeowner that the brother-in-law would assume the homeowner's duties under the contract. However, when the bill was sent to the brother-in-law, he inexplicably ignored it and used the $500 to buy a new television instead. The handyman has not yet filed suit against the brother-in-law but is weighing his options. Does the handyman have a right to recover the debt from the homeowner?
93	A state law provides that all persons who have been residents of the state for more than three years shall be entitled to free tuition at the state's main university. It further provides that persons who have resided in the state for three years or less shall pay the nonresident tuition rate, which is significantly higher. A student at the state's university who had been a state resident for less than three years filed a class action in federal court on behalf of himself and other similarly situated university students, seeking a declaration that the state statute is unconstitutional. When the case came to trial, the student had been a resident of the state for more than three years and was no longer required to pay tuition. By that time, a number of amicus curiae briefs had been filed in the case, some supporting and some opposing the student's position. Nevertheless, the state moved to dismiss the case as moot. Should the state's motion to dismiss be granted?
94	A plumber working for a company providing plumbing services to commercial and industrial establishments was required to be "on call" for emergency plumbing services 24 hours a day, and was required to drive his company van home each night so he would have all of his tools and equipment at hand for any calls. However, he was not permitted to use the company van for personal errands. On his way home one afternoon, he took a detour toward a supermarket a few blocks away to pick up some items for dinner. While entering the supermarket parking lot, he drove negligently and struck a pedestrian, seriously injuring him. The pedestrian filed suit against the plumber's company in a jurisdiction that maintains traditional common law rules regarding contribution and indemnity, and the jury awarded him $100,000 in damages, which the company paid. If the company sues the plumber to recoup its loss in the lawsuit, which party will prevail?
95	A federal statute prohibits the construction of nuclear energy plants in this country without a license from the Federal Nuclear Plant Siting Commission. The statute provides that the Commission may issue a license authorizing the construction of a proposed nuclear energy plant 30 days after the Commission makes a finding that the plant will comply with specified standards of safety, technological and commercial feasibility, and public convenience. In a severable provision, the Commission's enabling statute also provides that the Congress, by simple majorities in each house, may veto the issuance of a particular license by the Commission if such a veto occurs within 30 days following the required Commission finding. Early last year, the Commission found that Safenuke, Inc., met all statutory requirements and, therefore, voted to issue Safenuke, Inc., a license authorizing it to construct a nuclear energy plant. Because they believed that the issuance of a license to Safenuke, Inc., was not in accord with the applicable statutory criteria, a majority of each of the two houses of Congress voted, within the specified 30-day period, to veto the license. On the basis of that veto, the Commission refused to issue the license. Subsequently, Safenuke, Inc., sued the Commission in an appropriate federal district court, challenging the constitutionality of the Commission's refusal to issue the license. In this suit, the court should hold the congressional veto of the license of Safenuke, Inc., to be
96	The mayor of a town received several complaints from residents regarding the growing number of adult theaters and nude dancing establishments in a nearby town. To allay fears, the mayor asked the town's attorney what could be done to prevent or at least limit such establishments from setting up business in their town, which currently follows a zoning plan that provides for residential, commercial, and light industrial uses. Which of the following most correctly describes the town's constitutional options?
97	Seller and Buyer execute an agreement for the sale of real property on September 1, 1971. The jurisdiction in which the property is located recognizes the principle of equitable conversion and has no statute pertinent to this problem. Assume for this question only that Seller dies before closing and his will leaves his personal property to Perry and his real property to Rose. There being no breach of the agreement by either party, which of the following is correct'?
98	A state statute required all persons operating a catering business within the state to be licensed by the state board of health. The statute further provided that licenses will be granted only to applicants who have resided in the state for five years and who are citizens of the United States. A long-time resident of the state who was not a United States citizen challenges the requirement that applicants for licenses must be citizens of the United States. This provision is most likely:
99	Seller owned Blackacre, improved with an aging four-story warehouse. The warehouse was built to the lot lines on all four sides. On the street side, recessed loading docks permitted semi-trailers to be backed in. After the tractors were unhooked, the trailers extended into the street and occupied most of one lane of the street. Over the years, as trailers became larger, the blocking of the street became more severe. The municipality advised Seller that the loading docks could not continue to be used because the trailers blocked the street; it gave Seller 90 days to cease and desist. During the 90 days, Seller sold and conveyed Blackacre by warranty deed for a substantial consideration to Buyer. The problem of the loading docks was not discussed in the negotiations. Upon expiration of the 90 days, the municipality required Buyer to stop using the loading docks. This action substantially reduced the value of Blackacre. Buyer brought an appropriate action against Seller seeking cancellation of the deed and return of all monies paid. Such action should be based upon a claim of
100	Responding to an open bid solicitation from the procurement office of the Defense Department, a technologies company submitted a bid for the development of a new flame-resistant fabric. On review of the bids, the company was notified that it was the low bidder; however, its bid for the contract was denied because of its failure to meet guidelines on minority representation that the procurement office imposed on firms contracting with the Defense Department. Several months later, the project was rebid. Although the company did not participate, company officials later learned that the contract had been awarded to another regional company after the procurement office waived its minority representation guidelines for that project. The company whose bid had previously been rejected filed an action in federal district court seeking only to enjoin performance of the contract. The court should:
101	An architectural historian bought a house, financing $150,000 of the purchase price with a loan from a bank, secured by a mortgage on the property. The bank recorded its mortgage. Ten years later, the historian borrowed $5,000 from a finance company, using the house as security. The finance company recorded its mortgage on the property. Five years later, the historian obtained a $40,000 mortgage from a savings and loan association to pay for an addition to the house. The savings and loan association did not record its mortgage. Subsequently, the historian lost her job and was unable to make payments on either the finance company or the savings and loan mortgages. The finance company filed foreclosure of its mortgage, and the house was sold to a buyer at the foreclosure sale. After acquiring the property at the sale, what is the buyer's obligation regarding the bank's and the savings and loan association's mortgages?
102	In a suit by Palmer against Denby, Palmer sought to subpoena an audiotape on which Denby had narrated his version of the dispute for his attorney. Counsel for Denby moves to quash the subpoena on the ground of privilege. The audiotape is most likely to be subject to subpoena if
103	A patient troubled by an irritating skin rash consulted a dermatologist for treatment. The dermatologist diagnosed the rash as a genetic condition that had no cure and would ultimately spread and lead to disfigurement. The patient was shocked and upset by the diagnosis. On the advice of her family, a week later the patient consulted another doctor. That doctor immediately diagnosed the skin rash as a common bacterial infection and prescribed an ointment that cleared up the condition in a few days. Because the doctor was a friend of the family, the patient was not charged for that visit. Can the patient recover from the dermatologist for the emotional distress caused by his erroneous diagnosis?
104	A swimmer went to a privately owned lake resort whose owner charged a fee for admission. The beach had a roped-in swimming area and large signs directing swimmers not to swim anywhere but within the ropes. The lifeguards regularly enforced this rule. The resort also rented canoes and rowboats to its patrons, who could take them anywhere on the lake. The swimmer and two of his friends had rented a canoe and started to paddle out toward the other side of the lake when the swimmer saw a volleyball game starting on the beach that he wanted to join. He left his friends in the canoe and started swimming to shore. He was only a few yards outside of the roped-in swimming area when he started, but he angled away from the swimming area toward the area of the beach where the volleyball net was set up. Although the lifeguard on duty saw him, she did not warn him to return to the swimming area. When the depth of the water was about four feet, he put his foot down and was severely cut by the jagged edge of a rusted metal stake protruding a few inches out of the bottom of the lake. The swimmer had not seen the stake even though the water was clear and it was visible if he had looked down. If the swimmer sues the resort for his injury, he will:
105	A plaintiff sues her employer for sexual harassment. During the trial, the plaintiff attempts to introduce into evidence company records that include written complaints from other employees alleging that they too were sexually harassed by the employer. The defense objects to the admission of the records on the basis of hearsay. The objection should be:
106	A pet shop entered into a written contract with a distributor of pet products, whereby the distributor agreed to supply the pet shop with whatever quantity of pet food it might order, at a mutually agreed price, for two years, with an option to renew. Also, the contract required that the pet shop buy its pet food from the distributor only. For the first six months of the contract, the pet shop ordered from the distributor 10 cases of pet food per month. In the seventh month, the owner of the pet shop sold the shop, inventory, and accounts receivable to a chain operation. As part of the sale, the pet shop assigned to the chain operation its contract with the distributor. The chain operation promptly notified the distributor of the sale and assignment. That same month, looking to stock the pet food in stores throughout its chain, the chain operation sent the distributor an order for 5,000 cases of pet food "on the terms and conditions of the agreement expressed in the contract which has been assigned to us." The distributor did not have the means to fill such a large order and refused to deliver 5,000 cases. If the chain operation brings suit to compel the distributor to fill the order for 5,000 cases of pet food, who will prevail?
107	Oscar purchased a large bottle of No-Flake dandruff shampoo, manufactured by Shampoo Company. The box containing the bottle stated in part: "CAUTION--Use only 1 capful at most once a day. Greater use may cause severe damage to the scalp." Oscar read the writing on the box, removed the bottle, and threw the box away. Oscar's roommate, Paul, asked to use the No-Flake, and Oscar said, "Be careful not to use too much." Paul thereafter used No-Flake twice a day, applying two or three capfuls each time, notwithstanding the label statement that read: "Use no more than one capful per day. See box instructions." The more he used No-Flake, the more inflamed his scalp became, the more it itched, and the more he used. After three weeks of such use, Paul finally consulted a doctor who diagnosed his problem as a serious and irreversible case of dermatitis caused by excessive exposure to the active ingredients in No-Flake. These ingredients are uniquely effective at controlling dandruff, but there is no way to remove a remote risk to a small percentage of persons who may contract dermatitis as the result of applying for prolonged periods of time amounts of No-Flake substantially in excess of the directions. This jurisdiction adheres to the traditional common-law rules pertaining to contributory negligence and assumption of risk. If Paul asserts a claim against Oscar for his dermatitis injuries, Oscar's best defense will be that
108	To satisfy a debt owing to her friend, a granddaughter executed and delivered to the friend a warranty deed to a vacant tract of land. The friend promptly and properly recorded his deed. Shortly thereafter, the friend built a house on the property and has lived there since. The granddaughter did not actually own the vacant tract of land at the time. Her grandfather was the record title holder, but he had promised to leave the land to her. Later, the grandfather died and his will devised the land to the granddaughter. Pressed for money, the granddaughter sold the land to a creditor by warranty deed, which it promptly and properly recorded. Although the creditor paid full value for the land, it did not conduct a title search of the land before accepting the deed. Both the friend and the creditor now claim ownership of the land. The jurisdiction in which the land is located has the following statute: "No unrecorded conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value without notice unless the conveyance is recorded." Who has title to the land?
109	An acquaintance asked the defendant to give him a lift downtown because he did not have bus fare. While riding on the defendant's motorcycle, the acquaintance asked to stop at a convenience store to get a bottle of wine, showing the defendant a tire iron in his backpack that he was going to use. The defendant stopped at the store and waited in the parking lot while the acquaintance went in. He demanded money from the clerk, brandishing the tire iron. The clerk tried to grab a gun under the counter while he was filling a bag with money, and a struggle ensued. The gun discharged, killing the clerk. The defendant heard the gunshot and raced off, but was eventually apprehended. The jurisdiction's criminal code provides that a death caused during the commission of certain felonies, including robbery, is first degree felony murder, for which the death penalty is permitted. The code also permits cumulative penalties for first degree felony murder and for the underlying felony. The defendant was charged and convicted of both robbery and felony murder. After appropriate consideration of all relevant circumstances, the jury imposed the death penalty. On appeal, the defendant challenged both the convictions and the sentence. Assuming that the above facts were properly admitted into evidence, how should the appellate court rule?
110	A delivery company employed several messengers to deliver packages by car to nearby towns. The company also allowed some employees to use company cars for personal use from time to time. A clerical employee had her car in a body shop because she had run a red light and been broadsided by another vehicle. This was the second time she had run a light and been hit. She borrowed a company car for the weekend and was using it to do some grocery shopping. The employee negligently went through a red light and crossed the path of a rented van. The man driving the van swerved to avoid the employee and struck a light post and several parked cars, severely damaging the van. At the time of the accident, the driver of the van was exceeding the posted speed limit; he would have been able to avoid hitting the light post and the cars had he been going the proper speed. The leasing company that had rented the van to the driver brought a lawsuit against the delivery company employee and the delivery company. The jurisdiction retains traditional contributory negligence rules. If the delivery company prevails in the lawsuit, it will be because:
111	Under a written agreement Superpastries, Inc., promised to sell its entire output of baked buns at a specified unit price to Bonnie's Buns, Inc., a retailer, for one year. Bonnie's Buns promised not to sell any other supplier's baked buns. For this question only, assume the following facts. The parties' contract included a provision for termination by either party at any time upon reasonable notice. After six months of performance on both sides, Superpastries, claiming that its old bun-baker had become uneconomical and that it could not afford a new one, dismantled the bun-baker and began using the space for making dog biscuits. Superpastries' output of baked buns having ceased, Bonnie's Buns sued for breach of contract. Bonnie's Buns moves for summary judgment on liability, and Superpastries moves for summary judgment of dismissal. Which of the following should the court rule?
112	A defendant is charged with federal mail fraud based upon misrepresentations in his application for medical insurance coverage and for claims on policies that were subsequently issued. The application and claim forms containing the misrepresentations were mailed to the insurance company through the United States Postal Service. Specifically, the defendant failed to state his previous illnesses on both the application and claim form. The defendant denies the charges of having misrepresented his medical history. The prosecution wishes to offer as proof of his fraud the testimony of the defendant's physician, who will testify as to the defendant's history of previous illnesses. The defendant's attorney objects to the physician's testimony. The jurisdiction's physician-patient privilege applies to both civil and criminal proceedings. The court should rule that the physician's testimony is:
113	For this question only, assume the following facts. On October 1, Buyer told Seller, "I'm increasingly unhappy about our June 1 contract because of the current cattle market, and do not intend to buy your ranch unless I'm legally obligated to do so." If Seller sues Buyer on October 15 for breach of contract, Seller will probably
114	On March 1, Zeller orally agreed to sell his land, Homestead, to Byer for $46,000 to be paid on March 31. Byer orally agreed to pay $25,000 of the purchase price to Quincy in satisfaction of a debt which Zeller said he had promised to pay Quincy. On March 10, Byer dictated the agreement to his secretary but omitted all reference to the payment of the $25,000 to Quincy. In typing the agreement, the secretary mistakenly typed in $45,000 rather than $46,000 as the purchase price. Neither Byer nor Zeller carefully read the writing before signing it on March 15. Neither noticed the error in price and neither raised any question concerning omission of the payment to Quincy. Which of the following would be most important deciding an action by Quincy against Byer for $25,000 ?
115	Five years ago, Sally acquired Blackacre, improved with a 15-year-old dwelling. This year Sally listed Blackacre for sale with Bill, a licensed real estate broker. Sally informed Bill of several defects in the house that were not readily discoverable by a reasonable inspection, including a leaky basement, an inadequate water supply, and a roof that leaked. Paul responded to Bill's advertisement, was taken by Bill to view Blackacre, and decided to buy it. Bill saw to it that the contract specified the property to be "as is" but neither Bill nor Sally pointed out the defects to Paul, who did not ask about the condition of the dwelling. After closing and taking possession, Paul discovered the defects, had them repaired, and demanded that Sally reimburse him for the cost of the repairs. Sally refused and Paul brought an appropriate action against Sally for damages. If Sally wins, it will be because
116	A wholesaler persuaded a retailer to order a line of dolls for the Christmas season, even though the retailer was skeptical of the dolls' marketability. The contract provided that the retailer would pay $1,500 for its order of 100 dolls if they sold during the Christmas season. Some dolls did sell, but on February 12, the retailer had 80 of them in inventory. He sent the wholesaler notice that he would be returning the 80 dolls. The wholesaler replied that it did not want the dolls back, that the retailer should continue to try to sell them. Despite this reply, the retailer sent the wholesaler a check for $300 and shipped the dolls to the wholesaler, who refused to accept them but did accept the check. Thereafter, the retailer held the dolls at his warehouse. The wholesaler brought an action to recover the $1,200 balance. The wholesaler will:
117	Deben was charged with using a forged prescription from a Dr. Kohl to obtain Percodan* from Smith's Drugstore on May 1. At trial, Smith identified Deben as the customer, but Deben testified that he had not been in the store. In rebuttal, the prosecutor calls Wallman and Witler to testify that on May 1 a man they identified as Deben had presented prescriptions for Percodan' from a Dr. Kohl at, respectively, Wallman's Drugs and Witler's Drugstore. Wallman's and Witler's testimony is
118	The owner of a neighborhood tavern ordered 20 kegs of domestic beer from a brewery. The written contract between the parties provided that the brewery would deliver the beer by January 31, and the tavern owner would pay the brewery $1,400 upon delivery. The tavern owner was expecting a big crowd for Super Bowl Sunday, four days after the scheduled delivery date. The brewery did not deliver the beer to the tavern owner until February 16, but the tavern owner still accepted it. Did a duty to pay the $1,400 arise upon the tavern owner's acceptance of the beer on February 16?
119	The defendant was arrested, given Miranda warnings, and charged with burglary. At the police station, he telephoned his mother and asked her to come to the station to post bail. Instead, his mother immediately called the family attorney. In the meantime, the police had begun questioning the defendant. Although he never told the police to stop the questioning, his answers were at first vague or clearly unresponsive. During the course of the questioning, the family attorney phoned the station and told the police that she had been hired to represent the defendant and would be there in half an hour. The police did not inform the defendant of the attorney's call. Ten minutes later, the defendant admitted to committing the burglary, and signed a statement to that effect prepared by the police. The attorney arrived a few minutes later and advised the defendant to remain silent, but he told her that he had already signed a confession. How should the court rule on the attorney's pretrial motion to exclude the confession as evidence at trial?
120	A husband was on trial for the murder of his wife. During the course of the trial, the prosecution sought to introduce evidence that, six months before the wife's death, the husband had purchased a large insurance policy on her life, and two weeks prior to her death he purchased two more large policies on the wife's life from separate insurance carriers. If the defense objects to admission of such evidence, the objection should be:
121	Plaintiff is suing Doctor for medical malpractice occasioned by allegedly prescribing an incorrect medication, causing Plaintiff to undergo substantial hospitalization. When Doctor learned of the medication problem, she immediately offered to pay Plaintiff's hospital expenses. At trial, Plaintiff offers evidence of Doctor's offer to pay the costs of his hospitalization. The evidence of Doctor's offer is
122	A woman is suing a fast-food restaurant for injuries she suffered when she fell after slipping on a wet spot on the floor of the restaurant. At trial, the woman introduced evidence that someone had spilled a drink on the floor and that an employee had just finished mopping up the spill before she walked over the wet spot and fell, injuring her back. The woman then calls the restaurant's manager, as a hostile witness, and attempts to elicit testimony that, after her fall, the restaurant instituted a policy requiring that bright yellow signs with red warnings be placed after mopping the floor. Will this evidence be permitted?
123	While investigating the most recent of a series of murders, the detective in charge of the crime scene was approached by an onlooker who seemed to have detailed knowledge of the murders. The detective remembered seeing the onlooker at other murder scenes and became suspicious. He told the onlooker not to leave until the detective had the opportunity to ask him a few questions. After finishing with the crime scene, the detective started to question the onlooker at the scene of the crime without giving the onlooker the Miranda warnings. The onlooker eventually revealed details of the crime that were never made available to the public. As a result, the onlooker was arrested and charged with several murders. At trial, the onlooker testified that he believed that he could not leave until he had spoken with the detective. The onlooker's defense counsel moves to suppress the statements made to the homicide detective. What is the most likely result?
124	The owner of a small antique shop had purchased a 200-year-old powder horn inscribed with the name of a Revolutionary War hero. The curator of a nearby museum, which displays numerous other artifacts owned by the war hero, offered to buy the powder horn from the shop owner. The price offered was slightly higher than what the shop owner had been planning to ask for it when he offered it for sale and was a very fair price for an item of that nature. The shop owner, however, refused to sell to the curator because he did not like the way she had done business with other antique dealers in the past. The curator then turned to threats, saying that she had a power of attorney from the heirs of the war hero and that the law allowed her to bring a replevin action to seize it from the shop owner if he did not accept her offer. In fact, her statements were false and she knew that she had no power to obtain the powder horn. However, the shop owner believed her and reluctantly agreed to sell her the item for the price that she had offered. Can the shop owner recover damages in a misrepresentation suit against the curator?
125	The state of Red sent three of its employees to a city located in the state of Blue to consult with a chemical laboratory there about matters of state business. While in the course of their employment, the three employees of Red negligently released into local Blue waterways some of the chemical samples they had received from the laboratory in Blue. Persons in Blue injured by the release of the chemicals sued the three Red state employees and the state of Red in Blue state courts for the damages they suffered. After a trial in which all of the defendants admitted jurisdiction of the Blue state court and fully participated, plaintiffs received a judgment against all of the defendants for $5 million, which became final. Subsequently, plaintiffs sought to enforce their Blue state court judgment by commencing a proper proceeding in an appropriate court of Red. In that enforcement proceeding, the state of Red argued, as it had done unsuccessfully in the earlier action in Blue state court, that its liability is limited by a law of Red to $100,000 in any tort case. Because the three individual employees of Red are able to pay only $50,000 of the judgment, the only way the injured persons can fully satisfy their Blue state court judgment is from the funds of the state of Red. Can the injured persons recover the full balance of their Blue state court judgment from the state of Red in the enforcement proceeding they filed in a court of Red?
126	A mechanic was tried for the aggravated assault of a nurse. The mechanic called a witness to the witness stand. The witness was to testify that the night before the alleged crime, the mechanic stated to the witness that he was going to visit his mother in a distant city some 1,000 miles away. The testimony is:
127	Parr sued Davis for damages for physical injuries allegedly caused by Davis's violation of the federal civil rights law. The incident occurred wholly within the state of Chippewa but the case was tried in federal court. The Chippewa state code says, "The common-law privileges are preserved intact in this state." At trial, Davis called Dr. Webb, Parr's physician, to testify to confidential statements made to him by Parr in furtherance of medical treatment for the injuries allegedly caused by Davis. Parr objects, claiming a physicianpatient privilege. The court should apply
128	A store security guard who reasonably but mistakenly thought that a shopper had tried to steal a scarf directed her to accompany him to the manager's office, which had an interior window overlooking the sales floor. Because the blinds were up on the window, the occupants of the office could be seen from the sales floor. After the security guard described what he had seen, the manager began to berate her for trying to steal the scarf and threatened to prosecute her as a shoplifter. However, the manager had neglected to make sure that the public address system that he used to announce specials was turned off, and his statements were broadcast to everyone in the store. In an action against the store for defamation, the shopper will:
129	On April 1, a music store offered to sell a rare piano to a concert pianist for $100,000. The following day, the pianist wrote to the store owner: "I have decided to purchase the piano. A check for $100,000 is enclosed. I am leaving for Canada for six months and will pick up the piano when I return. I will pay you to store the piano in an air-conditioned warehouse." The letter that the pianist wrote to the store owner is:
130	At the trial of an action against Grandmother on behalf of Patrick, the following evidence has been introduced. Grandson and his friend, Patrick, both aged eight, were visiting at Grandmother's house when, while exploring the premises, they discovered a hunting rifle in an unlocked gun cabinet. They removed it from the cabinet and were examining it when the rifle, while in Grandson's hands, somehow discharged. The bullet struck and injured Patrick. The gun cabinet was normally locked. Grandmother had opened it for dusting several days before the boys' visit, and had then forgotten to relock it. She was not aware that it was unlocked when the boys arrived. If the defendant moves for a directed verdict in her favor at the end of the plaintiff's case, that motion should be
131	The plaintiff, an electrical contractor, sued the defendant homeowner for refusal to pay for extensive wiring repairs performed on his home by the plaintiff's employee. The plaintiff called the employee to the stand. The employee, under oath, testified that he did not perform any work at the defendant's home. The employee also denied writing a letter to a friend telling the friend that the employee was going to do electrical work on the home. Without releasing the employee as a witness, the plaintiff offers into evidence the letter written by the employee to his friend. If the employee's letter to his friend is properly authenticated, the trial court should:
132	A homeowner owed a contractor $1,400 for work that the contractor did on her home. Pursuant to the contract between the parties, the $1,400 was due on September 1. After the homeowner told the contractor that she probably would not be able to pay the $1,400 on September 1, the contractor agreed to extinguish the debt if the homeowner, who was the manager of an appliance store, purchased a washer and dryer that the contractor's mother wanted and had it delivered to the mother's home and set up by September 15. Because the homeowner's manager discount would allow her to pay only $1,000 for the washer and dryer, which had a list price of $1,200, she agreed and the parties signed a writing to that effect on August 26. Is the new agreement between the homeowner and the contractor legally enforceable?
133	In 1945 Owen, owner of both Blackacre and Whiteacre, executed and delivered two separate deeds by which he conveyed the two tracts of land as follows: Blackacre was conveyed "To Alpha and his heirs as long as it is used exclusively for residential purposes, but if it is ever used for other than residential purposes, to the American Red Cross." Whiteacre was conveyed "To Beta and her heirs as long as it is used exclusively for residential purposes, but if it is used for other than residential purposes prior to 1965, then to the Salvation Army." In 1950 Owen died leaving a valid will by which he devised all his real estate to his brother, Bill. The will had no residuary clause. Owen was survived by Bill and by Owen's daughter, Della, who was Owen's sole heir. For the purpose of this set of questions, it may be assumed that the common law rule against perpetuities applies in the state where the land is located and that the state also has a statute providing that, "All future estates and interests are alienable, descendible, and devisable in the same manner as possessory estates and interests." In 1946 the interest of the American Red Cross in Blackacre could be best described as a
134	Under the terms of a written contract, Karp agreed to construct for Manor a garage for $10,000. Nothing was said in the parties' negotiations or in the contract about progress payments during the course of the work. For this question only, assume the following facts. After completing 25% of the garage strictly according to Manor's specifications, Karp assigned his rights under the contract to Banquo as security for an $8,000 loan. Banquo immediately notified Manor of the assignment. Karp thereafter, without legal excuse, abandoned the job before it was half-complete. Karp subsequently defaulted on the loan from Banquo. Karp has no assets. It will cost Manor at least $8,000 to get the garage finished by another builder. If Banquo sues Manor for $8,000, which of the following will the court decide?
135	Penkov suffered a severe loss when his manufacturing plant, located in a shallow ravine, was flooded during a sustained rainfall. The flooding occurred because City had failed to maintain its storm drain, which was located on City land above Penkov's premises, and because Railroad had failed to maintain its storm drain, which was located on Railroad land below Penkov's premises. The flooding would not have occurred if either one of the two storm drains had been maintained properly. Penkov sued Railroad to recover compensation for his loss. The evidence in the case established that the failures of the two drains were caused by the respective negligence of City and Railroad. There is no special rule insulating City from liability. In his action against Railroad, Penkov should recover
136	The plaintiff brought suit against the defendant for breach of a contract involving the sale of 100 imported coffee tables, alleging that the defendant improperly rejected a shipment of tables. The defendant defends by introducing evidence that the shipment delivered to his place of business was only 68 coffee tables, which he rejected. The plaintiff introduced part of a letter he sent to the defendant the day after the contract was signed stating that import issues may briefly delay the plaintiff's acquisition of the entire quantity of tables. The defendant then offers evidence that another part of the letter stated, "There is no obligation to receive any coffee tables unless they are delivered in one lot of 100 tables." If the plaintiff objects to this evidence, the court will likely rule that:
137	An owner of a store heard several gunshots and rushed out into the street. He found a victim lying on the sidewalk, bleeding profusely. She gasped to the owner, "I'm going to die. My upstairs neighbor shot me." The victim lapsed into unconsciousness and died on the way to the hospital without uttering another word. The neighbor was arrested and charged with the murder of the victim. At the neighbor's trial, the prosecution seeks to have the store owner testify as to the victim's statement. Such testimony should be ruled:
138	Pemberton and three passengers, Able, Baker, and Charley, were injured when their car was struck by a truck owned by Mammoth Corporation and driven by Edwards. Helper, also a Mammoth employee, was riding in the truck. The issues in Pemberton v. Mainmmoth include the negligence of Edwards in driving too fast and failing to wear glasses, and of Pemberton in failing to yield the eight of way. Mammoth's counsel seeks to have Sheriff testify that while he was investigating the accident he was told by Pemberton, "This was probably our fault." The judge should rule the proffered evidence
139	A landowner with a 40-acre tract of land had inherited 30 acres and had acquired the other 10 acres by adverse possession from a rancher. The landowner entered into a land sale contract promising to convey the 40 acres to a developer. The contract provided that the landowner would convey marketable title. The developer paid the landowner the purchase price and accepted a deed from him. The developer promptly recorded the deed. The rancher, having learned of the sale, brought a successful action against the developer to quiet title. The developer realized for the first time that there were no covenants for title in his deed. The developer brings an action against the landowner. What is the most likely outcome of the suit?
140	A new synthetic liquid was created that could safely double the output of electrical power plants. One byproduct of the production of the liquid was a hazardous chemical that was not biodegradable in the environment. A stateof-the-art manufacturing plant was built to produce this liquid, and the manufacturing plant secured an expert opinion on how to dispose of the hazardous chemical byproduct. The expert concluded that the earth beneath the disposal site was impermeable, and that there was no danger of contaminating the underground waters if the chemical were buried. Based on this expert opinion, the hazardous chemical was buried in a depression on the land because the head of the manufacturing plant reasonably believed that it was safe. The chemical, nonetheless, seeped through the underlying soil strata, and was carried by the flow of percolating water to a neighboring well used by the adjacent sheep farm to water the sheep. The chemical rendered the water in the well unfit for consumption by sheep. The sheep farmer had bought the farm after the plant was built. While he was unaware of the hazardous chemical disposal underground when he bought the farm, the sheep farmer was later told his well may be contaminated, and he did nothing about it. The sheep were harmed by drinking from the contaminated well, and the sheep farmer asserts a claim against the manufacturing plant for damages to the sheep in a jurisdiction that follows traditional contributory negligence rules. Which of the following is the manufacturing plant's best defense?
141	A man shopping for a leather jacket at a clothing store could not decide between two jackets, so the proprietor, who knew the man and his family well, let him take one of the jackets on approval. No mention was made by the proprietor of the method of payment he expected. The man wore the jacket on a visit to his grandfather, who liked it so much that when the man told him what the jacket cost and that he had taken it on approval, the grandfather said he would buy it for him if he promised to give some of his old clothes to a favorite charity for the poor at Christmastime. The man wholeheartedly agreed to donate the clothes to the charity at Christmas. Very pleased, the grandfather called the shop and told the proprietor to send the bill for the jacket to him, which he did. Before the bill was paid and before the Christmas season arrived, the grandfather fell ill and died. The grandfather's executor has refused to pay the bill, and the man has not yet given any old clothing to the charity. Will the proprietor be able to recover the price of the jacket from the estate?
142	A worker at a petrochemical plant was severely burned when a pipe carrying hot oil exploded. The worker brought a negligence action against the company that manufactured and installed the pipe. At trial, the worker established what happened and the injuries he suffered. He also presented evidence that the pipe burst because it had corroded at a higher than normal rate, which according to testimony of the worker's experts indicated a defect in the manufacture of the pipe. At the close of the worker's case, the manufacturer moved for a directed verdict. The court should:
143	The defendant is on trial for fraudulently signing a check for $10,000. The defendant has denied that she signed the check. The prosecutor calls the landlord of the apartment building in which the defendant has resided for three months before her arrest. The landlord intends to testify that it is the defendant's signature on the check, and he bases his opinion of the authenticity of her signature on the ground that he saw her sign the lease to his apartment. The trial court should find this testimony:
144	A citizen who is unhappy about a recent decision of his city council stood in front of city hall and gave an extemporaneous speech belittling each member of the city council. During the diatribe, the citizen made the following statement: "If there is a God, the city council members will surely burn in hell forever." A state statute, enacted in 1898, prohibited "the public utterance of any blasphemy or sacrilege," and provided criminal penalties for its violation. On hearing the citizen's utterances, a police officer arrested him for violating the 1898 statute. The local district attorney decided to proceed with prosecution of the case, only the third recorded such prosecution in the state's history. Which of the following arguments would not be helpful for the citizen's defense?
145	Current national statistics show a dramatic increase in the number of elementary and secondary school students bringing controlled substances (drugs) to school for personal use or distribution to others. In response, Congress enacted a statute requiring each state legislature to enact a state law that makes it a state crime for any person to possess, use, or distribute, within 1,000 feet of any elementary or secondary school, any controlled substance that has previously been transported in interstate commerce and that is not possessed, used, or distributed pursuant to a proper physician's prescription. This federal statute is
146	A landowner and her neighbor owned adjoining tracts of land. No public road abut the neighbor's land, so the landowner grante the neighbor an express easement over the north 25 feet of the landowner's land. However, the following month the county extended the public road to the neighbor's land, and he ceased using the easement for ingress and egress. Twenty years later, the neighbor conveyed the easement to his friend, who owned the land adjoining the other side of the landowner. The following year, the neighbor conveyed his land to the landowner. None of the parties has used the easement since the public road was extended. The jurisdiction has a 15-year statute of limitations for acquiring property interests by adverse possession. At what point was the easement extinguished?
147	A builder of racing cars entered into a contract with a buyer to sell him a hand-built car for $25,000. The price was to be paid and the car was to be delivered one week later. Unbeknownst to the buyer, the builder's wife had a one-half interest in the car. The day after the contract was signed, the builder called the buyer and told him about his wife's half interest in the car, and that she would not go along with the sale at $25,000 but would agree to a sale for $40,000. If the buyer sues the builder for breach of contract, will the court find that there is an enforceable contract for $25,000?
148	A state's legislature passed a statute that required every used car sold in the state to be tested prior to sale to determine whether it was in compliance with a set of strict exhaust emission standards that were also included in the legislation. Used cars would have to be brought up to standard and pass the emissions test prior to sale. Certain persons in the state object to the legislation because one of its results will be to raise the average price of used cars in the state. Only cars to be sold for junk are exempt from the statute. Among the following, who would be most likely to have standing to raise a constitutional challenge to the legislation?
149	A woman and a man had lived together for several years but had never married because the man was already married. During the time the woman and the man lived together, they had accumulated property. One day, the man told the woman to move out. The state in which they lived recognized in general the validity of property agreements entered into by unmarried couples who lived together, but there was a statute that provided that such agreements were void as being against public policy when one of the parties living together was married to another. The woman brought suit against the man, alleging that they had an agreement to share equally all property accumulated by them during the time they lived together, and challenging the constitutionality of the statute. Will the woman prevail in her challenge to the statute?
150	O'Neal entered into a written contract to sell her house and six acres known as Meadowacre to Perez for $75,000. Delivery of the deed and payment of the purchase price were to be made six months after the contract. The contract provided that Meadowacre was to be conveyed "subject to easements, covenants, and restrictions of record"' The contract was not recorded. After the contract was signed but before the deed was delivered, Electric Company decided to run a highvoltage power line in the area and required an easement through a portion of Meadowacre. O'Neal, by deed, granted an easement to Electric Company in consideration of $5,000; the deed was duly recorded. The power line would be a series of towers with several high-voltage lines that would be clearly visible from the house on Meadowacre but would in no way interfere with the house. When Perez caused the title to Meadowacre to be searched, the deed of easement to Electric Company was found. O'Neal appeared at the time and place scheduled for the closing and proffered an appropriate deed to Perez and demanded the purchase price. Perez refused to accept the deed. In an appropriate action for specific performance against Perez, O'Neal demanded $75,000. In this action, O'Neal should
151	Which of the following acts by the United States Senate would be constitutionally IMPROPER?
152	A seller owned a two-acre tract of land, on which he built a single-family residence. The seller entered into a contract to sell the land to a buyer for $200,000. One week before closing, the buyer had a survey of the property made. It revealed that a portion of the seller's house was 5.98 feet from the sideline. The applicable zoning ordinance requires a six-foot sideline setback. The buyer refused to go ahead with the purchase of the land on the ground that the seller's title was not marketable. If the seller brings suit against the buyer for specific performance, will he prevail?
153	An ex-convict, who spent nine years in prison for car theft, vowed to get even with the prosecutor of his trial. While in prison, the ex-convict was told by another prisoner, a drug dealer, that when the prosecutor was in private practice as a criminal defense attorney, he had represented the drug dealer in a drug charge. The drug dealer claimed that because he did not have the cash to pay the prosecutor his fees, he offered to pay his fees with five ounces of cocaine, and the prosecutor accepted. Although the ex-convict had no independent reason to know whether what the drug dealer said was true, he believed that it was. When he got out of prison he learned that the prosecutor was running for district attorney. The ex-convict went to one of the local papers and sold them the story for $1,000. In the article that resulted, the ex-convict was quoted as saying, "I only hope that the prosecutor suffers like I had to suffer for the last nine years." Although the allegation was false, the prosecutor withdrew from the race as a result of the article. In a suit by the prosecutor against the ex-convict for defamation, the probable result would be:
154	Dooley was a pitcher for the City Robins, a professional baseball team. While Dooley was throwing warm-up pitches on the sidelines during a game, he was continuously heckled by some spectators seated in the stands above the dugout behind a wire mesh fence. On several occasions, Dooley turned and looked directly at the hecklers with a scowl on his face, but the heckling continued. Dooley wound up as though he was preparing to pitch in the direction of his catcher; however the ball traveled from his hand at high speed, at a 90-degree angle from the line to the catcher and directly toward the hecklers in the stands. The ball passed through the wire mesh fence and struck Patricia, one of the hecklers. Patricia brought an action for damages against Dooley and the City Robins, based upon negligence and battery. The trial court directed a verdict for the defendants on the battery count. The jury found for the defendants on the negligence count because the jury determined that Dooley could not foresee that the ball would pass through the wire mesh fence. Patricia has appealed the judgments on the battery counts, contending that the trial court erred in directing verdicts for Dooley and the City Robins. For this question only, assume that, on appeal, the court holds that the question of whether Dooley committed a battery is a jury issue. The judgment entered on the directed verdict in favor of the City Robins should then be
155	A defendant who had been arrested for running an illegal narcotics operation hired the top criminal defense attorney in the area to represent him. Before his trial, he was notified that virtually all of his money was going to be seized by the government because he had earned it by selling drugs. The government then entered a restraining order to that effect, preventing him from making payments on services for which his attorney had billed him. May the government seize the funds earmarked for the defendant's attorneys' fees?
156	Defendant is on trial for the murder of his father. Defendant's defense is that he shot his father accidentally. The prosecutor calls Witness, a police officer, to testify that on two occasions in the year prior to this incident, he had been called to Defendant's home because of complaints of loud arguments between Defendant and his father, and had found it necessary to stop Defendant from beating his father. The evidence is
157	The proprietor of a food brokerage entered into oral negotiations with a manufacturer of gourmet food products for restaurants and select retail outlets. The proprietor wished to secure an exclusive distributorship for the manufacturer's products in the six New England states. At the end of the first stage of oral negotiations, the parties had come to an agreement on the major points, and only a few minor points of disagreement remained. Both, however, were anxious to begin distribution of the food products in New England, and the manufacturer assured the proprietor, "Don't worry about it; we'll work these things out." Assuming from this that he would be the New England distributor for the food products, the proprietor leased larger facilities, bought a number of trucks, and hired new workers. Shortly thereafter, the manufacturer informed the proprietor that another distributor, and not the proprietor, would receive the New England distributorship. If the proprietor prevails in a suit against the manufacturer, it will most likely be because the court applies which of the following theories?
158	Two years ago, an expert gemologist told the owner of a sapphire ring that the ring was probably worth about $6,000, although the gemologist never gave a formal appraisal. The ring's owner now is in need of cash and offered to sell it to his friend. She liked the ring but had no idea of its value. She therefore suggested that the owner take it to a reputable jeweler for an appraisal, and if the price was not too high, she would buy it from him. The owner did not tell his friend about the gemologist's opinion because he hoped the ring's value had increased. The owner took the ring to a reputable jeweler, who told the owner in good faith that there was a tiny flaw in the stone that reduced the ring's value to $4,800. The jeweler noted that if the stone were perfect, the ring would be worth $6,200. Although the ring's owner was disappointed, he told his friend that she could have it for its appraised value: $4,800. Unbeknownst to the friend or the ring's owner, the jeweler was suffering from a minor eye infection that caused him to find a "flaw" where none, in fact, existed. After she purchased the ring from its owner for $4,800, the friend sought her own appraisal for insurance purposes. A reputable jeweler issued the friend an appraisal document accurately stating the ring's value at $6,200. The ring's (now-former) owner learned of this and demanded return of the ring in exchange for the money she had paid for it. The friend refused. If the original owner of the ring sues his friend to replevy the ring, will the court rule in his favor?
159	In a trial between Jones and Smith, an issue arose about Smith's ownership of a horse, which had caused damage to Jones's crops. Jones seeks to introduce in evidence a photograph of his cornfield in order to depict the nature and extent of the damage done. The judge should rule the photograph
160	A federal statute requires United States civil service employees to retire at age 75. However, that statute also states that civil service employees of the armed forces must retire at age 65. Prentis, a 65-year-old civil service employee of the Department of the Army, seeks a declaratory judgment that would forbid his mandatory retirement until age 75. The strongest argument that Prentis can make to invalidate the requirement that he retire at age 65 is that the law
161	For many years, civil service rules have provided that any member of the city's police department must serve a one-year probationary period before he or she will be considered a permanent employee. However, because the rules were enacted before the city's police academy was established, a prospective police officer now spends six months in the academy before being hired by the city. A graduate of the police academy was with the city police department for eight months after graduation when she was terminated. There were no city ordinances or state laws that required that she be given either a reason for the termination or a hearing, and she was given neither. The graduate brought suit against the city in state court because of the termination of her employment, alleging a violation of her due process rights. Which of the following would most likely give her a constitutional basis to require the city to give her a statement of reasons for the termination and an opportunity for a hearing?
162	A witness was in a store when she heard a screeching of brakes and immediately rushed out of the store. She saw a car speeding off into the distance and found a victim, badly injured and lying in the street. The victim gasped to the witness, "I'm going to die. The car that hit me had license number DD666!" The victim then lapsed into unconsciousness. The witness gave her information to the police, including a description of the car and the victim's comment on the license plate. The police traced the registration to the defendant. The victim recovered from his injuries and filed suit against the defendant for his injuries. At the trial, the victim wants to have the witness testify as to the victim's statement regarding the defendant's license number. The court should rule that such testimony by the witness is:
163	Doctor, a licensed physician, resided in her own home. The street in front of the home had a gradual slope. Doctor's garage was on the street level, with a driveway entrance from the street. At two in the morning Doctor received an emergency call. She dressed and went to the garage to get her car and found a car parked in front of her driveway. That car was occupied by Parker, who, while intoxicated, had driven to that place and now was in a drunken stupor in the front seat. Unable to rouse Parker, Doctor pushed him into the passenger's side of the front seat and got in on the driver's side. Doctor released the brake and coasted the car down the street, planning to pull into a parking space that was open. When Doctor attempted to stop the car, the brakes failed to work, and the car crashed into the wall of Owner's home, damaging Owner's home and Parker's car and injuring Doctor and Parker. Subsequent examination of the car disclosed that the brake linings were badly worn. A state statute prohibits the operation of a motor vehicle unless the brakes are capable of stopping the vehicle within specified distances at specified speeds. The brakes on Parker's car were incapable of stopping the vehicle within the limits required by the statute. Another state statute makes it a criminal offense to be intoxicated while driving a motor vehicle. If Parker asserts a claim against Doctor for his injuries, Parker will probably
164	The police received a tip from a reliable informant that a former student at the local university was selling narcotics. A brief investigation revealed that the former student, a college dropout, still hung around the university campus, had no visible means of support, and yet drove a large luxury car and wore flashy clothing and jewelry. The police picked up the former student the next time he showed up on campus, took him to the station, and questioned him all night long without a break and without letting him communicate with anyone else. When the former student tired from the interrogation, he admitted that he sold cocaine to his friend, who is a current student at the university. Based on this information, the police went to the current student's dormitory room. When they arrived, they found the door open but no one was in the room. The police entered, searched the room, and discovered a vial of white powder. Later laboratory tests established the powder to be cocaine. The former student was then charged with the sale of narcotics. At his trial, the prosecution attempted to admit the cocaine discovered in the dormitory room into evidence. What is the former student's best argument for preventing the cocaine from being admitted into evidence?
165	Trelawney worked at a day-care center run by the Happy Faces Day Care Corporation. At the center, one of the young charges, Smith, often arrived with bruises and welts on his back and legs. A statute in the jurisdiction requires all day-care workers to report to the police cases where there is probable cause to suspect child abuse and provides for immediate removal from the home of any suspected child abuse victims. Trelawney was not aware of this statute. Nevertheless, he did report Smith's condition to his supervisor, who advised him to keep quiet about it so the day-care center would not get into trouble for defaming a parent. About two weeks after Trelawney first noticed Smith's condition, Smith was beaten to death by his father. Trelawney has been charged with murder in the death of Smith. The evidence at trial disclosed, in addition to the above, that the child had been the victim of beatings by the father for some time, and that these earlier beatings had been responsible for the marks that Trelawney had seen. Smith's mother had been aware of the beatings but had not stopped them because she was herself afraid of Smith's father. Trelawney's best argument that he is NOT guilty of murder is
166	An owner conveyed her parcel of land to her church "for the life of my son, and from and after the death of my said son to all of my grandchildren and their heirs and assigns in equal shares; provided that the church shall use the premises for church purposes only." In an existing building on the property, the church immediately began to conduct religious services and other church activities. Subsequently, the church granted a construction company the right to remove sand and gravel from a one-half acre portion of the property on payment of a royalty. The construction company has regularly removed sand and gravel since and paid a royalty to the church. The church has continued to conduct religious services and other church activities on the property. All four of the living grandchildren of the owner, joined by a guardian ad litem to represent unborn grandchildren, instituted suit against the church and the construction company seeking damages for the removal of sand and gravel and an injunction preventing further acts of removal. There is no applicable statute. Which of the following best describes the likely disposition of this lawsuit?
167	A state statute makes criminal "all speechmaking, picketing, or public gathering of any sort on the steps of the supreme courthouse Monday through Friday, between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., when court is in session." A citizen is upset about a supreme court decision that was just released and stands on the steps of the courthouse at noon, while court is in session, handing out leaflets and exhorting passersby to vote the state supreme court justices out of office. If the citizen is prosecuted for violation of the statute, which of the following best describes the applicable burden of proof?
168	Chemco manufactured a liquid chemical product known as XRX. Some XRX leaked from a storage tank on Chemco's property, seeped into the groundwater, flowed to Farmer's adjacent property, and polluted Farmer's well. Several of Farmer's cows drank the polluted well water and died. If Farmer brings an action against Chemco to recover the value of the cows that died, Farmer will
169	A landowner validly conveyed a parcel of land to a veterinarian "for so long as the property is used as an animal shelter, but if the property is used for any other purpose, it is to go to the American Cancer Society." Two years later, the landowner died, validly devising all of his property to his friend. The landowner's only heir is his daughter. Although this jurisdiction is a common law jurisdiction with respect to all real property considerations, the state's probate laws provide that future interests or estates in real property may be passed by will or descent in the same manner as present or possessory interests. Last month, the veterinarian approached the daughter and asked her to join with him to sell the parcel of land, which he had been using as an animal shelter, in fee simple absolute to a developer. The veterinarian and the daughter entered into a contract of sale with the developer. However, after consultation with an attorney, the veterinarian decided against the sale. The developer sued the daughter and the veterinarian for specific performance. The requested relief will be:
170	A water pipe burst in the basement of Supermart, a grocery store, flooding the basement and damaging cases of canned goods on the floor. The Plumbing contractor's workmen, in repairing the leak, knocked over several stacks of canned goods in cases, denting the cans. After settling its claims against the landlord for the water leak and against the plumbing contractor for the damage done by his workmen, Supermart put the goods on special sale. Four weeks later Dotty was shopping in Supermart. Several tables in the market were covered with assorted canned foods, all of which were dirty and dented. A sign on each of the tables read: "Damaged Cans-Half Price." Dotty was having Guest for dinner that evening and purchased two dented cans of tuna, packed by Canco, from one of the tables displaying the damaged cans. Before Guest arrived, Dotty prepared a tuna casserole which she and Guest ate. Both became ill and the medical testimony established that the illness was caused by the tuna's being unfit for consumption. The tuna consumed by Dotty and Guest came from the case that was at the top of one of the stacks knocked over by the workmen. The tuna in undamaged cans from the same Canco shipment was fit for consumption. If Dotty asserts a claim against Canco based on negligence, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is
171	At the request of local police, airport security officials made random searches of passenger luggage for contraband as it was being sent to the baggage claim area, although they did not have legal authority to search bags without a warrant. The searches were conducted so that there was no delay in the luggage being released to those claiming their bags. A traveler went to the baggage claim area but his luggage, which contained a number of valuables but no contraband, did not appear. It had been selected for a search but the X-ray machine had malfunctioned and security officers were having difficulty getting it unlocked to search it by hand. When the traveler inquired about the luggage, he was told that it was being inspected and that he would have to remain in the area if he wanted to claim it when it was released, and that its return could not be guaranteed if he was not around when it was released. About 30 minutes later, the luggage was returned to the traveler with an apology for the delay. The delay caused the traveler to miss his train to the city, so he had to pay for cab fare. Assuming there are no issues of governmental immunity, can the traveler bring an action against the airport security officials for false imprisonment?
172	The owner of a small fleet of taxicabs had his cabs serviced by a national chain of auto service centers. One of his cabs went through a stop sign when its brakes failed without warning. The ensuing collision seriously injured the passenger. An investigation revealed that brake repairs had been made on the cab a week before, but the service center's mechanic had used the wrong parts and had made numerous errors in reassembling the brakes. If the passenger sues the cab company owner for her injuries:
173	A paraplegic woman was sitting in her wheelchair in the park when a disheveled man approached her and grabbed her tightly by her hands and began to pray. The man claimed that he was a faith healer and that he could heal the woman so that she could walk again. In actuality, the man was an outpatient at a local hospital's mental health section. The woman brought a suit against the man for battery. At trial, the trier of fact determined that the man knew she had not consented to his grasping her hands, but that he truly believed that he had the ability to heal her. If the man asserts as a defense that he was mentally disabled, this defense is:
174	In a tort case involving personal injury, a hospital orderly is called to the stand. There is some dispute as to whether the plaintiff ever lost consciousness. The plaintiff's attorney wishes to have the orderly, who was working in the hospital emergency room when the plaintiff was brought in, testify that the plaintiff was unconscious at the time she entered the emergency room. Would such testimony be admissible over the defendant's objection?
175	Growers of potatoes in the state recently began spraying a pesticide onto their crops to prevent the spread of a pest that can destroy young potato plants. The pesticide is manufactured exclusively by one company at its plant. When the plant is producing the pesticide it emits a fine, sticky, harmless mist as a byproduct. The mist drifts over a plaintiff's property, which is adjacent to the company's plant. Although the company uses the best technology available, it is unable to prevent the release of the mist. The plaintiff brings suit against the company on the theory of private nuisance to enjoin the production of the pesticide at the company's plant. Which of the following facts, if established, will be most helpful to the company's defense?
176	A passenger on a cruise ship went to the ship's spa for a hot rock massage. A hostess had the passenger lie on her stomach and placed warm stones on her back. The hostess told the passenger that the ship's licensed masseuse would be in to begin her massage when the rocks cooled, in approximately half an hour. Only several minutes later, however, a man came into her room and began rubbing her back. Unbeknownst to the passenger, the man was not the masseuse but another passenger on the ship acting on a dare from his friends. The man continued to massage the passenger awkwardly for several minutes, at times pinching her back uncomfortably. When the passenger finally spoke up in protest, the man ran out of the room, laughing hysterically. The incident humiliated the passenger and caused her extreme distress. If the passenger sues the cruise ship for negligence, which of the following defenses would most likely show that the cruise ship is not liable?
177	A homeowner contracted for construction of a custom-built, elevated deck in his backyard. The deck's designer supervised the construction, which was carried out by several employees of a local building company. The homeowner was pleased with the appearance of the deck, but the first time he stepped on it, a support on one side of the deck gave way, causing the homeowner to fall and be injured. The homeowner brought an action joining the building company and the deck's designer as defendants, alleging negligence. In his complaint, he alleged that he does not know which of the defendants is responsible for the damages. Which of the following doctrines would be most helpful against the designer?
178	A suspect was arrested for a misdemeanor battery and was not provided Miranda warnings at that time. He was placed in a "holding pen" while waiting to post bond. Before he could do so, a detective in charge of investigating a string of burglaries noticed that the suspect matched the description of the serial burglar. The detective brought the suspect from the holding pen into a room specifically reserved for interrogation. The detective had the suspect take a seat next to the door, which the detective left open. The detective gave him Miranda warnings and then began questioning him about the burglaries. Caught by surprise that he was being questioned for the burglaries rather than the battery, the suspect signed the rights waiver and provided a statement confessing to the burglaries. On proper motion, should the suspect's statement be suppressed?
179	Plaza Hotel sued Plaza House Hotel for infringement of its trade name. To establish a likelihood of name confusion, Plaintiff Plaza Hotel offers a series of memoranda which it had asked its employees to prepare at the end of each day listing instances during the day in which telephone callers, cab drivers, customers, and others had confused the two names. The memoranda should be
180	A federal statute appropriated $7 million for a nationwide essay contest on "How the United States Can Best Stop Drug Abuse." The statute indicates that its purpose is to generate new, practical ideas for eliminating drug abuse in the United States. Contest rules set forth in the statute provide that winning essays are to be selected on the basis of the "originality, aptness, and feasibility of their ideas." The statute expressly authorizes a first prize of $1 million, 50 second prizes of $100,000 each, and 100 third prizes of $10,000 each. It also states that judges for the contest are to be appointed by the President of the United States with the advice and consent of the Senate, and that all residents of the United States who are not employees of the federal government are eligible to enter and win the contest. A provision of the statute authorizes any taxpayer of the United States to challenge its constitutionality. In a suit by a federal taxpayer to challenge the constitutionality of the statute, the court should
181	A mining company closed down operations at an isolated mine it owned and informed the electric company that electricity in the power poles that led to the mine should be cut off. However, the electric company, following its standard policy, left the power running in the line to deter thieves from stealing valuable transformers and cables. The mining company was unaware that the power was left on. A hitchhiker who was passing by the entrance to the mine saw that it was closed, so he went onto the property and climbed up a power pole to steal a transformer. He received an electric shock and fell from the pole, suffering serious injuries. If the hitchhiker sues the mining company, which of the following is the mining company's strongest defense?
182	In which of the following situations is Defendant most likely to be guilty of the crime charged?
183	Congress created the National Agency for Burglar Alarms ("NABA"), giving it the power to regulate both burglar alarm hardware and installation personnel. NABA adopted a regulation requiring that all burglar alarm installation companies be licensed, and providing that anyone installing an alarm without a license could be fined. The regulation also provided that any company in the installation business on the day the regulation was adopted automatically would receive a license, but to obtain a license thereafter, an applicant would have to show that he has worked as an installer at a licensed company for at least three years. A man who has been installing alarm systems for eight years sold his installation business a few months before the NABA regulation was adopted and went to work for the purchaser servicing his old accounts. A few months after the NABA regulation was adopted, a representative from a national department store chain approached the man with an offer to hire him as an independent contractor to revamp the chain's alarm systems. The man quit his job and applied for an NABA installer's license. His application was denied because he was not in business on the day the NABA regulation was adopted and had worked for a licensed installer for only a few months. The man decided to install the alarm systems anyway. Can the man properly be fined for installing alarms?
184	Dirk is on trial for the brutal murder of Villas. Dirk's first witness, Wesley, testified that in her opinion Dirk is a peaceful and nonviolent person. The prosecution does not crossexamine Wesley, who is then excused from further attendance. Which one of the following is INADMISSIBLE during the prosecution's rebuttal?
185	Landover, the owner in fee simple of Highacre, an apartment house property, entered into an enforceable written agreement with VanMeer to sell Highacre to VanMeer. The agreement provided that a good and marketable title was to be conveyed free and clear of all encumbrances. However, the agreement was silent as to the risk of fire prior to the closing, and there is no applicable statute in the state where the land is located. The premises were not insured. The day before the scheduled closing date, Highacre was wholly destroyed by fire. When VanMeer refused to close, Landover brought an action for specific performance. If Landover prevails, the most likely reason will be that
186	The State of Aurora requires licenses of persons "who are engaged in the trade of barbering." It will grant such licenses only to those who are graduates of barber schools located in Aurora, who have resided in the state for two years, and who are citizens of the United States. Assume that a resident of the state of Aurora was denied a license because she had been graduated from an out-of-state barber school. Her suit in federal court to enjoin denial of the license on this ground would be
187	To encourage her neighbor to continue pursuing her avocation of photography, an art patron promised to buy her first photographic work that wins a prize in a juried art show. To show that she was serious, the art patron gave her neighbor a contract to sign which stated that she agreed to buy and the neighbor agreed to sell the neighbor's first framed photograph that wins a ribbon (first, second, or third prize) in a juried art show, with payment due within 14 days of delivery. Price was not mentioned in the contract, which was enforceable in all other respects. Both parties signed the contract. Some months later, the neighbor won first prize for one of her photos set in an expensive frame. The parties made arrangements for the art patron to take possession of the piece. The neighbor insisted on a price of $1,200, pointing to the expensive frame and the prestige of the art show that awarded the prize. The art patron instead tendered $700, a good faith approximation of the value of the photo display, and sued when the neighbor refused to deliver it. If the neighbor defends on the ground that no price was fixed in the contract and the parties have been unable to agree on a price, the court should hold that:
188	A small business owner filed a treble damages civil antitrust suit against a large corporation. While the corporation's director of marketing was on the stand, the corporation's attorney produced a "synopsis of sales," a document generated by the corporation's marketing division. In response to an objection by the small business owner's attorney that the record was hearsay, the corporation's attorney contended that the document is admissible as a business record. The small business owner's attorney argued that the document was actually a self-serving writing concocted for the litigation rather than made in the ordinary course of business, and demanded a hearing to determine whether this qualifies as a business record. Which of the following is the most appropriate way for the issue to be decided?
189	A witness is called in a contract action between a plaintiff and a defendant. The witness takes his oath and testifies. During cross-examination, the defendant's attorney asked the witness this question: "Isn't it true that even though you took an oath to tell the truth so help you God, you are an atheist and don't even believe in God?" Upon the proper objection, will the judge require that the witness answer truthfulness.
190	A property owner owned a tract of commercial property that he conveyed in joint tenancy to his twin sons as a birthday present. Unfortunately, a few years after the conveyance, the property owner and his sons had a serious falling out over how to run the family business. The property owner no longer wished the sons to control valuable commercial property, and so he demanded that they return the deed with which he conveyed the property to them. The sons returned the deed, and the property owner destroyed it. A few months later, one of the twins learned that he was seriously ill and not likely to live much longer. He executed a quitclaim deed conveying "any interest I have in the commercial property conveyed to me and my brother from my father" to his daughter. The twin who conveyed the property subsequently died. Who owns the property?
191	Adam owned Blackacre. Adam entered into a written three-year lease of Blackacre with Bertha. Among other provisions, the lease prohibited Bertha from "assigning this lease, in whole or in part, and from subletting Blackacre, in whole or in part." In addition to a house, a barn, and a one-car garage, Blackacre's 30 acres included several fields where first Adam, and now Bertha, grazed sheep. During the following months, Bertha: I. By a written agreement allowed her neighbor Charles exclusive use of the garage for storage, under lock and key, of his antique Packard automobile for two years, charging him $240. II. Told her neighbor Doris that Doris could use the fields to practice her golf as long as she did not disturb Bertha's sheep. Which, if any, of Bertha's actions constituted a violation of the lease?
192	A state statute defines all murders as second degree murders unless deliberation and premeditation can be shown, in which case the crime is elevated to first degree murder. Manslaughter is defined as at common law. The defendant wanted to steal some papers from a business associate's office, and so he arranged to have a meeting with her at her office. When the associate left the room, the defendant put a knockout drug in her coffee. After she passed out from drinking the coffee, the defendant rummaged through her files, finding and stealing the papers that he wanted. Unfortunately, the defendant miscalculated the dosage, and the business associate died. The crimes below are listed in descending order of seriousness. What is the most serious offense of which the defendant can be convicted?
193	As part of a comprehensive federal aid-to-education program, Congress included the following provisions as conditions for state receipt of federal funds: (1) Whenever textbooks are provided to students without charge, they must include no religious instruction and must be made available on the same terms to students in all public and private schools accredited by the state educational authority. (2) Salary supplements can be paid to teachers in public and private schools, up to ten percent of existing salary schedules, where present compensation is less than the average salary for persons of comparable training and experience, provided that no such supplement is paid to any teacher who instructs in religious subjects. (3) Construction grants can be made toward the cost of physical plant at private colleges and universities, provided that no part of the ant is used for buildings in which instruction in religious subJect matters is offered. Federal taxpayer Allen challenges the provision that allows the distribution of free textbooks to students in a private school where religious instruction is included in the curriculum. On the question of the adequacy of Allen's standing to raise the constitutional question, the most likely result is that standing will be
194	A man owned a tract of land in fee simple. Fifteen years ago, he built a barn on five acres that he believed were part of his property. One year later, the man discovered that the five acres on which he had built his barn were not part of his property. The five acres actually belonged to a woman. The next year, the woman died, leaving all of her property to her one-year-old daughter. Now the man brings a quiet title action against the daughter. The statutory period for adverse possession in this jurisdiction is 10 years. Who will prevail?
195	A landlord leased office space to a businessman for five years, ending on November 1, reserving a yearly rent of $24,000, payable monthly. On October 1 of the fifth year, the businessman notified the landlord that he was preparing to move, but would greatly appreciate if the landlord could extend the lease for a month or two. On October 10, the landlord wrote to the businessman that she thought they could reach a satisfactory arrangement, but did not hear back from the businessman. The businessman did not vacate the office until November 20. On November 30, the landlord received a check from the businessman in the amount of $1,333 for "November's rent" and a note that he had vacated the premises. If the landlord brings an action against the businessman for additional rent, the court will rule that:
196	Amy Docent, a state college instructor, was discharged because of her refusal to comply with a state statute requiring public employees to swear or affirm that they will (1) "uphold and defend" the state and federal constitutions and (2) "oppose the overthrow" of the state or federal governments "by force, violence, or by any improper method." The statute had previously been held constitutional by the state supreme court. Docent filed a complaint in federal district court alleging the unconstitutionality of the statute and seeking an injunction and damages. Which of the following is the state's strongest argument for sustaining the validity of the statute?
197	In 1970, Oscar, owner of a 100-acre tract, prepared and duly recorded a subdivision plan called Happy Acres. The plan showed 90 one-acre lots and a ten-acre tract in the center that was designated "Future Public School." Oscar published and distributed a brochure promoting Happy Acres which emphasized the proximity of the lots to the school property and indicated potential tax savings "because the school district will not have to expend tax money to-acquire this property." There is no specific statute concerning the dedication of school sites. Oscar sold 50 of the lots to individual purchasers. Each deed referred to the recorded plan and also contained the following clause: "No mobile home shall be erected on any lot within Happy Acres." Sarah was one of the original purchasers from Oscar. In 1976, Oscar sold the remaining 40 lots and the ten-acre tract to Max by a deed which referred to the plan and contained the restriction relating to mobile homes. Max sold the 40 lots to individual purchasers and the ten-acre tract to Pete. None of the deeds from Max referred to the plan or contained any reference to mobile homes. Assume for this question only that in 1977 the school board of the district in which Happy Acres is situated has voted to erect a new school on the ten-acre tract. In an appropriate action between the school board and Pete to determine title, the result will be in favor of
198	Dawson was charged with felony murder because of his involvement in a bank robbery. The evidence at trial disclosed that Smith invited Dawson to go for a ride in his new car, and after a while asked Dawson to drive. As Smith and Dawson drove around town, Smith explained to Dawson that he planned to rob the bank and that he needed Dawson to drive the getaway car. Dawson agreed to drive to the bank and to wait outside while Smith went in to rob it. As they approached the bank, Dawson began to regret his agreement to help with the robbery. Once there, Smith got out of the car. As Smith went out of sight inside the bank, Dawson drove away and went home. Inside the bank, Smith killed a bank guard who tried to prevent him from leaving with the money. Smith ran outside and, finding that his car and Dawson were gone, ran down an alley. He was apprehended a few blocks away. Dawson later turned himself in after hearing on the radio that Smith had killed the guard. The jurisdiction has a death penalty that applies to felony murder. Consistent with the law and the Constitution, the jury may convict Dawson of
199	The federal government contracted with a number of communications utilities to install fiberoptic communication lines between major federal offices across the country. The utilities, which maintained ownership of the lines, contracted with the federal government to install the lines on a "cost plus fixed fee" basis, whereby all installation costs would be reimbursed by the government. One such line was installed in a state's capital city, where the Department of the Interior maintained its western regional office. The state imposes a tax on the installation of all communication lines in the state, including fiberoptic cable lines. It seeks to impose the tax on the line running to the federal office. Will the state be permitted to impose the tax?
200	A defendant is charged with trafficking in firearms, in violation of federal firearms control laws, as well as receiving stolen property. The charges arise from the defendant's having attempted to sell a semi-automatic weapon identified as one of dozens that were stolen from a warehouse a year ago. The defendant denies intending to sell the gun or knowing that it had been stolen. At trial, which of the following would the court be least likely to allow the prosecution to introduce as evidence against the defendant?
201	A wealthy philanthropist owned a mansion built to his exact specifications, featuring a pipe organ built into the wall of the music room. The organ was impressive, with beautiful hand-carved wood scrollwork. The accompanying bench was made from the same wood as the organ and was carved to match the patterns on the organ. The bench was fully movable and could be slid into a niche beside the organ when not in use, although the philanthropist usually left the bench in front of the organ for its matching effect, even when the organ was not being played. The philanthropist died, and his will left all of his personal property to his daughter and all of his real property to a local charity. After the will was admitted to probate, the daughter removed all of the furniture and other movables from the mansion, including the organ bench. The daughter refused the charity's request to return the bench to the mansion. If the charity brings suit against the daughter to replevy the bench, the court will rule in favor of:
202	A contractor gave the low bid for some electrical repairs to a homeowner's house. Based on this bid, the contractor and the homeowner entered into a contract stating that the contractor would perform the electrical repairs for $6,000. Before beginning work on the project, the contractor notified the homeowner that he would lose money on the job at that price, and would not proceed with the work unless the homeowner would agree to increase the price to $9,000. The homeowner thereupon, without notifying the contractor, entered into a contract with an electrician to make the repairs for $7,500, which was the fair market cost of the work to be done. The electrician finished the house on schedule and then showed the homeowner that he (the electrician) had spent $8,500 on the job. The homeowner thereupon paid the electrician the full balance of their contract price plus an additional $1,000, so that the electrician would not lose money on the job. In a contract action by the homeowner against the contractor, the homeowner will recover:
203	Acorp and Beeco are companies that each manufacture pesticide X. Their plants are located along the same river. During a specific 24-hour period, each plant discharged pesticide into the river. Both plants were operated negligently and such negligence caused the discharge of the pesticide into the river. Landesmann operated a cattle ranch downstream from the plants of Acorp and Beeco. Landesmann's cattle drank from the river and were poisoned by the pesticide. The amount of the discharge from either plant alone would not have been sufficient to cause any harm to Landesmann's cattle. If Landesmann asserts a claim against Acorp and Beeco, what, if anything, will Landesmann recover?
204	A retailer entered into a written contract with a wholesaler whereby the wholesaler agreed to sell, and the retailer agreed to buy, 100 boxes of sunglasses manufactured by a large corporation located in a neighboring city. The agreed-upon price was $75 per box. Two weeks before the specified delivery date, the wholesaler told the retailer that it would not be able to fill its order, because of unexpected high demand for sunglasses this season. Although the retailer learned that the needed quantity of the same brand of sunglasses could be shipped within two days for $83 per box from a supplier in another area, the retailer instead purchased 100 boxes of the sunglasses locally at a cost of $90 per box. These sunglasses were of a slightly higher quality than the sunglasses that were originally contracted for. A few days before the original delivery date, the wholesaler notified the retailer that it would fill the order, and tendered 100 boxes of the sunglasses on the date of delivery. However, the retailer refused to accept them. At that time, the wholesale market price of the sunglasses had declined to $80 per box. If the retailer sues the wholesaler for damages based on the wholesaler's alleged breach, the retailer is likely to recover:
205	A state legislature revised its tax laws to reclassify inherited money as "income," making it subject to the state's high income tax. The legislation was exceedingly complicated and difficult for laypersons, or even trained professionals, to comprehend. Additionally, a provision stated: "Any person who knowingly fails to declare as income any monies received during a tax year shall be guilty of a felony." During the first tax year in which the new tax law was in effect, a woman inherited $3,500 from her uncle. When the woman received her tax forms, she was confused because of all the complicated computation schedules and fine print. The State Department of Revenue had planned to include a supplemental booklet explaining the new law along with the tax forms. However, a computer glitch caused the booklet not to be included in the mailings. The woman called her attorney and asked him if the inherited money needed to be included on her income tax return. The attorney assured her that the income tax applied only to earned income, interest, and dividends. The woman also called the regional branch of the State Department of Revenue. The telephone operator transferred her call to a part-time intern in the revenue department, who, after explaining who he was, told the woman that inherited funds were not "income" for purposes of the income tax. The woman filed her state income tax return, but did not declare the $3,500 inherited from her uncle. If the woman is subsequently charged with a felony pursuant to the statute quoted above, which of the following represents the woman's best defense?
206	Although they were never legally married, a couple had lived together for many years and had held themselves out to be husband and wife. They were driving through a sparsely populated area of a state when the wife complained to the husband of severe pains in her abdominal area. She asked her husband to stop in the next city to have a doctor at the city's hospital examine her. After the city, the next town was more than 100 miles away. Thinking that the wife's condition was not serious, and because it was getting to be late in the afternoon and the husband had a reservation at the inn in the town that would be automatically canceled if they did not arrive before 6 p.m., he refused to stop at the city and drove on toward the town. In fact, the wife was suffering from an attack of acute appendicitis. Her appendix burst before they reached the town, and she was on the point of expiring when the husband arrived at the town's clinic. A nurse attended to the wife and called a doctor, the only physician in the county, and he arrived 30 minutes later. The doctor negligently concluded that it was too late to save the wife's life, and she died two hours later. The autopsy also revealed that the wife had a fatal form of cancer that would have caused her death in a few months. After a coroner's inquest into the death of the wife, the husband was charged with murder. Which of the following is most beneficial to the husband's defense in a jurisdiction that follows the common law as to homicide crimes?
207	Peter was rowing a boat on a mountain lake when a storm suddenly arose. Fearful that the boat might sink, Peter rowed to a boat dock on shore and tied the boat to the dock. The shore property and dock were the private property of Owner. While the boat was tied at the dock, Owner came down and ordered Peter to remove the boat, because the action of the waves was causing the boat to rub against a bumper on the dock. When Peter refused, Owner untied the boat and cast it adrift. The boat sank. Peter was wearing a pair of swimming trunks nothing else. He had a pair of shoes and a parka in the boat, but they were lost when Owner set it adrift. Peter was staying at a cabin one mile from Owner's property. The only land routes back were a short rocky trail that was dangerous during the storm, and a 15-mile road around the lake. The storm continued with heavy rain and hail, and Peter having informed Owner of the location of his cabin, asked Owner to take him back there in Owner's car. Owner said, " You got here by yourself and you'll have to get back home yourself." After one hour the storm stopped, and Peter walked home over the trail. If Peter asserts a claim against Owner for loss of the boat, the most likely result is that Owner will
208	A landowner contracted in writing to sell a lot to a brother and a sister, as joint tenants, for $60,000. The brother and the sister put up $6,000 as earnest money. Before the closing date, the landowner died. Shortly thereafter, and also before the closing date, a garage on the lot burned down. The garage had a fair market value of $6,500 and was a complete loss. After the fire, the brother demanded that the executor of the landowner's estate return the $6,000, because the brother and sister were no longer interested in the property. The executor refused and told the brother that he expected the brother and sister to tender the $54,000 due on the property when the closing date arrived. The brother and sister did not do so. The brother filed suit demanding a refund of the $6,000. The executor countersued, demanding specific performance by the brother and sister or, in the alternative, monetary damages. Absent any applicable statutes, how should the court rule?
209	Adam entered into a valid written contract to sell Blackacre, a large tract of land, to Betsy. At that time, Blackacre was owned by Adam's father, Fred; Adam had no title to Blackacre and was not the agent of Fred. After the contract was executed and before the scheduled closing date, Fred died intestate, leaving Adam as his sole heir. Shortly thereafter, Adam received an offer for Blackacre that was substantially higher than the purchase price in the contract with Betsy. Adam refused to close with Betsy although she was ready, willing, and able to close pursuant to the contract. Betsy brought an appropriate action for specific performance against Adam. In that action, Betsy should be awarded
210	A student purchased a chemistry set from the manufacturer through its website. The set contained printed warnings instructing users to mix the chemicals only according to the formulas provided. Nevertheless, the student combined a variety of chemicals in an attempt to make an adhesive remover. The chemicals he mixed generated toxic fumes, which caused him to suffer lung damage. The student brought a strict liability action against the manufacturer. If the manufacturer prevails, it will be because:
211	While driving at a speed in excess of the statutory limit, Dant negligently collided with another car, and the disabled vehicles blocked two of the highway's three northbound lanes. When Page approached the scene two minutes later, he slowed his car to see if he could help those involved in the collision. As he slowed, he was rear-ended by a vehicle driven by Thomas. Page, who sustained damage to his car and was seriously injured, brought an action against Dant to recover damages. The jurisdiction adheres to the traditional common-law rules pertaining to contributory negligence. If Dant moves to dismiss the action for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, should the motion be granted?
212	A man and a woman lived together for many years but never got married. Although the state in which they reside does not recognize common law marriage, it has statutes that prohibit discrimination on the basis of marital status. The man and the woman purchased a large property, taking title as joint tenants. Subsequently, the woman accumulated a $20,000 debt. She was too embarrassed to tell the man but was able to convince a bank to hold a mortgage on the property in exchange for the money. The bank was also willing to accept the woman's signature alone, and the man never learned about the mortgage. Two years later, the woman died without having paid off the mortgage. She left no will, and her only heir at law is her sister. The state in which the property is located is a "lien theory" mortgage state. Who has title to the property?
213	A businessman entered into a contract to sell his office complex to a purchaser for $1 million. The purchaser paid the businessman $100,000 in earnest money. The day before the date set for closing, the purchaser died intestate, leaving her niece as her only heir. The niece showed up at the closing with a certified check for $900,000. Which of the following is correct?
214	A candidate for a state legislature brought an action under the Fourteenth Amendment against a privately owned cab company to compel the company to accept his political advertisements on its vehicles. The cab company is licensed by a rural county within the state in which the candidate is running. As part of its taxi business, the cab company uses pickup trucks to ferry its largely rural-based customers and the agriculturally related items they often carry around. The company sells space on the wooden slats surrounding the bed of each pickup truck to commercial advertisers, but it refuses to carry any political advertising. Which of the following is the strongest justification for the trial court's denying the candidate any relief?
215	David entered the county museum at a time when it was open to the public, intending to steal a Picasso etching. Once inside, he took what he thought was the etching from an unlocked display case and concealed it under his coat. However, the etching was a photocopy of an original that had been loaned to another museum. A sign over the display case containing the photocopy said that similar photocopies were available free at the entrance. David did not see the sign. Burglary in the jurisdiction is defined as "entering a building unlawfully with the intent to commit a crime." David is guilty of
216	A statute of the state of Texona prohibits any retailer of books, magazines, pictures, or posters from "publicly displaying or selling to any person any material that may be harmful to minors because of the violent or sexually explicit nature of its pictorial content." Violation of this statute is a misdemeanor. Corner Store displays publicly and sells magazines containing violent and sexually explicit pictures. The owner of this store is prosecuted under the above statute for these actions. In defending against this prosecution in a Texona trial court, the argument that would be the best defense for Corner Store is that the statute violates the
217	A wholesale seller of turquoise received a fax from a retail seller of Indian jewelry, a long-time customer, which read: "Send 200 16-inch strands of Kingman turquoise beads at your usual price of $45 per strand." The wholesaler faxed the customer back a confirmation, promising to ship the strands within 10 days. However, the wholesaler currently had no strands in stock and so began making phone calls to locate them in sufficient quantity. Ultimately, he secured the strands of beads. However, before he could ship the beads to the retailer, he received another fax from the retailer canceling the order without explanation. The wholesaler immediately set out to find another buyer for the beads, but found that Kingman turquoise had fallen out of favor. Consequently, the wholesaler was forced to sell the strands of beads at a "salvage" price of $4,000. If the wholesaler sues the retailer for damages, how much should he receive?
218	A landowner owned a large parcel of land in a rural area. He built his home on the northern half of the property, and developed a large orchard of fruit trees on the southern portion. A county road ran in front of the northern portion. To service his orchard, the landowner built a driveway directly from the county road across the northern portion of the property to the orchard. To provide electricity to his house, the landowner ran an overhead power line across the orchard property to hook up to the only available electric power pole located on the far southern side of the property. Subsequently, the landowner conveyed the northern parcel to his brother and the southern parcel to his daughter, who said that she did not mind having the power line on the property. Recently, the brother has begun parking his car on the driveway, thus blocking the daughter's access to the southern parcel. Finding no recorded document granting an easement for the power line, the daughter has decided to remove it. If the brother is successful in preventing the daughter from removing the power line, it will be because:
219	A homeowner borrowed $50,000 from a bank, secured by a mortgage on his home. Shortly thereafter, the homeowner sold his home to a buyer for $70,000 by a deed containing a recital signed by both parties that title passed "subject to" the bank's mortgage, "which obligation grantee expressly assumes." The buyer paid the homeowner $20,000, took possession of the house, and began making monthly payments of principal and interest to the bank. A few years later, a chemical manufacturing firm built a huge sulfur processing plant just down the road from the home, which caused the house to immediately decline in value to $35,000. Subsequently, the buyer stopped making the monthly payments to the bank. The bank exercised its contractual right of nonjudicial foreclosure and sold the house at a public auction for $34,000. The bank then brought suit against the homeowner and the buyer for $14,000, the difference between the proceeds of the foreclosure sale and the $48,000 principal remaining due on the original loan to the homeowner. The jurisdiction does not bar deficiency judgments. The bank should be granted a judgment for $14,000 against:
220	A franchised United States dealer of a very popular German car contracted with a doctor to sell him the car for $29,000 cash, the sale to be consummated after delivery to the dealer of the car, which the dealer ordered from the manufacturer specifically for the doctor. The average retail markup in such sales is 30%. The signed retail contractual document was a form drafted by the dealer's lawyer, and the doctor did not question or object to any of its terms. When the car arrived from Germany, the doctor repudiated the contract. The dealer at once sold the car for $29,000 cash to another buyer, for whom the dealer had also ordered from the manufacturer a car identical to the doctor's. In an action against the doctor for breach of contract, the dealer will probably recover:
221	A music show promoter was handing out leaflets at a county fair, advertising a commercial country and western music concert scheduled at the fairgrounds two weeks after the county fair was due to end. The fair manager approached the promoter and politely asked him to stop distributing leaflets because it was in contravention of the fair's rules. The promoter refused to stop, and the manager summoned a county police officer. In the officer's presence, the manager again told the promoter to stop handing out the leaflets. The promoter ignored the manager again and continued to hand out leaflets, at which point he was arrested for criminal trespass and charged in municipal court. At trial, the promoter defended against the charges by claiming a violation of his First Amendment rights. Which of the following, if true, is most damaging to the promoter's First Amendment claims?
222	A defendant is on trial for aggravated assault. The defendant claims that he was merely a bystander and that another person was the actual aggressor. The defendant calls a witness to testify that the defendant has a reputation for being a "good and loving person who would never hurt anyone." The trial judge should rule the testimony:
223	Traveler was a passenger on a commercial aircraft owned and operated by Airline. The aircraft crashed into a mountain, killing everyone on board. The flying weather was good. Traveler's legal representative brought a wrongful death action against Airline. At trial, the legal representative offered no expert or other testimony as to the cause of the crash. On Airline's motion to dismiss at the conclusion of the legal representative's case, the court should
224	In the application for a life insurance policy, Mary answered in the negative the question, "Have you ever had any heart disease?" Both the application and the insurance policy which was issued provided: "Applicant warrants the truthfulness of the statements made in the application and they are made conditions to the cont ract of insurance." Unknown to Mary, she had had a heart disease at a very early age. The policy provided that the proceeds were not to be paid over to the named beneficiary, Mary's daughter, Joan, "until she reaches the age of 21." No contingent beneficiary was named in the policy. Mary was killed in an automobile accident two months after the policy was issued. Joan died one month later at the age of 19 from injuries incurred in the same accident. If no objection is made concerning Mary's misstatement in the application, how is the court most likely to construe the clause dealing with the payment of the proceeds to Joan?
225	An owner of land gave his valet a deed which conveyed a specified piece of property. He then died. The owner's son introduces evidence that the owner had promised him in writing that, if he was ever going to get rid of that piece of property, the son would have the right to purchase it first. The trial court will:
226	A father and his son were arguing on the front lawn of the son's house. The father, who was a bigger and slower man, attempted to end the argument by pushing his son as hard as he could. The son, fearful that his father would continue to escalate the fight as he has done in the past, tackled the father and pinned him to the ground, although the son could have easily escaped into his house. If the son is tried for battery, he should be found:
227	An interior decorator asked a woodworker she met at a crafts fair to build a curly maple armoire. They entered into a written contract, with a contract price of $6,500 to be paid upon the decorator's receipt of the armoire. When the work was completed, the woodworker shipped the armoire to the decorator. After inspecting it, the decorator felt that it was not of the same high level of workmanship as she was expecting, given the other furniture that the woodworker had showcased at the fair, and a good faith dispute arose between the parties as to the workmanship. The decorator sent the woodworker a check for $4,000 marked "payment in full." The woodworker indorsed and cashed the check, then sued the decorator to recover the $2,500 balance. Most courts would hold that:
228	A defendant was charged under the Federal Kidnapping Act when he kidnapped his ex-girlfriend and took her across state lines, holding -her against her will for five days until she was reported missing and finally found. During the defendant's federal trial, the ex-girlfriend rebuts his assertion that she voluntarily accompanied him by stating that she inflicted severe gashes on his body with her fingernails during her attempts to escape, and that the defendant had to be treated by a physician to prevent infection. The defendant denies seeking treatment for any such injuries. The prosecution calls a physician, who will testify that he treated the defendant's wounds the day after the kidnapping took place. The defendant's attorney objects. The jurisdiction's physicianpatient privilege applies to both civil and criminal proceedings. The court should rule that the physician's testimony is:
229	A plaintiff purchased a new car manufactured by a corporation from a local dealership. While the plaintiff was driving home from the dealership, she stopped at a stop sign. She was struck from behind by a jeep driven by a driver who had negligently failed to stop. On impact, the plaintiff was injured when she hit her head on the front windshield. The plaintiff was wearing a seat belt at the time of the impact which should have prevented this, but the seat belt buckle was defective and failed to hold the plaintiff. Assume that a state law requires all automobiles to be equipped with seat belts that will prevent drivers from hitting their heads on windshields on impact. If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the driver, the plaintiff will:
230	Allen and Bradley were law school classmates who had competed for the position of editor of the law review. Allen had the higher grade point average, but Bradley was elected editor, largely in recognition of a long and important note that had appeared in the review over her name. During the following placement interview season, Allen was interviewed by a representative of a nationally prominent law firm. In response to the interviewer's request for information about the authorship of the law review note, Allen said that he had heard that the note attributed to Bradley was largely the work of another student. The firm told Bradley that it would not interview her because of doubts about the authorship of the note. This greatly distressed Bradley. In fact the note had been prepared by Bradley without assistance from anyone else. If Bradley asserts a claim against Allen based on defamation, Bradley will
231	A salesman in a highly visible and competitive field went to the police station to post bond for his son, who had been arrested for possession of a small quantity of narcotics. A photographer for the local newspaper who was at the police station took a picture of the salesman flanked by two bulky police officers. The photo, which looked like the pictures of alleged criminals being taken into custody, ran on a quarter of the front page because it was a slow news day. The photo was accompanied by a very small caption giving the salesman's name and stating that his son had been arrested for possession of narcotics. The salesman's boss was hypersensitive about the reputation of his company and fired the salesman after he saw the picture in the newspaper. If the salesman sues the newspaper, he will:
232	Owner owned a hotel, subject to a mortgage securing a debt Owner owed to Lender One. Owner later acquired a nearby parking garage, financing a part of the purchase price by a loan from Lender Two, secured by a mortgage on the parking garage. Two years thereafter, Owner defaulted on the loan owed to Lender One, which caused the full amount of that loan to become immediately due and payable. Lender One decided not to foreclose the mortgage on Owner's hotel at that time, but instead brought an action, appropriate under the laws of the jurisdiction and authorized by the mortgage loan documents, for the full amount of the defaulted loan. Lender One obtained and properly filed a judgment for that amount. A statute of the jurisdiction provides: "Any judgment properly filed shall, for ten years from filing, be a lien on the real property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person against whom the judgment is rendered." There is no other applicable statute, except the statute providing for judicial foreclosure of mortgages, which places no restriction on deficiency judgments. Lender One later brought an appropriate action for judicial foreclosure of its first mortgage on the hotel and of its judgment lien on the parking garage. Lender Two was joined as a party defendant, and appropriately counterclaimed for foreclosure of its mortgage on the parking garage, which was also in default. All procedures were properly followed and the confirmed foreclosure sales resulted as follows: Lender One purchased the hotel for $100,000 less than its mortgage balance. Lender One purchased the parking garage for an amount that is $200,000 in excess of Lender Two's mortgage balance. The $200,000 surplus arising from the bid paid by Lender One for the parking garage should be paid
233	Congress passed a bill to relocate a special forces training center. The bill included funds to facilitate the move and mandated that the funds be so spent. The bill was signed into law by the President. Thereafter, the senators from the state in which the training center is currently located informed the President that they would withdraw their support for an important bill he favored if the move takes place. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the power of the President on this issue?
234	A student and a few of his friends were making their way to spring break. Along the way, the old van that they were driving broke down. Not wanting to miss any part of spring break festivities, the student asked the mechanic on duty at the repair shop for a rush job. The mechanic provided the student with a repair estimate, and the student, on the basis of the estimate, authorized the repair and promised to pay when he came back to pick up the van. When the mechanic called the student to tell him that the van was repaired, the student, rather than paying for the repair, told one of his friends that the mechanic had agreed to finance the repair charges and that the only thing left to do was pick up the van in the garage's parking lot. The student handed the friend a key to the van and told him to go pick the van up so that they could continue their trip to spring break. The friend did so. If the mechanic makes a criminal complaint against the student for larceny of the van, the student will most likely be found:
235	The federal statute admitting the state of Blue to the Union granted Blue certain public lands, and established some very ambiguous conditions on the subsequent disposition of these lands by Blue. This federal statute also required the new state to write those exact same conditions into its state constitution. One hundred years later, a statute of Blue dealing with the sale of these public lands was challenged in a state court lawsuit on the ground that it was inconsistent with the conditions contained in the federal statute, and with the provisions of the Blue Constitution that exactly copy the conditions contained in the federal statute. The trial court decision in this case was appealed to the Blue Supreme Court. In its opinion, the Blue Supreme Court dealt at length with the ambiguous language of the federal statute and with cases interpreting identical language in federal statutes admitting other states to the union. The Blue Supreme Court opinion did not discuss the similar provisions of the Blue Constitution, but it did hold that the challenged Blue statute is invalid because it is "inconsistent with the language of the federal statute and therefore is inconsistent with the identical provisions of our state constitution." If the losing party in the Blue Supreme Court seeks review of the decision of that court in the United States Supreme Court, the United States Supreme Court should
236	A federal law requiring that all automobiles driven on United States military bases be equipped with air bags would most probably be justified by:
237	Jones and Smith, who were professional rivals, were attending a computer industry dinner where each was to receive an award for achievement in the field of data processing. Smith engaged Jones in conversation and expressed the opinion that if they joined forces, they could do even better. Jones replied that she would not consider Smith as a business partner and when Smith demanded to know why, told him that he, Smith, was incompetent. The exchange was overheard by Brown, who attended the dinner. Smith suffered emotional distress but no pecuniary loss. If Smith asserts a claim against Jones based on defamation, will Smith prevail?
238	The police of a resort town discovered that a well-known cat burglar was currently living in town under an assumed name. To try to catch her in the act of burglary, an undercover officer approached the burglar with a plan for a burglary. The undercover officer told the burglar that he knew who she was and that he had a plan to steal jewels from someone staying in one of the town's resorts. The burglar initially refused the offer; however, after lengthy cajoling, she finally agreed to the plan. As the time for the burglary drew near, the burglar had second thoughts. Three hours before the theft was scheduled to take place, the burglar called the police and told them of the plan. She told them that she was not going to show up, but that her cohort (the undercover officer) would be there, and told them how to recognize the undercover officer. Is the burglar guilty of conspiracy at common law?
239	A witness testified against a defendant in a contract action. The defendant then called a friend to the stand, who testified that the witness had a bad reputation for truth and veracity. The defendant then also called the witness's employee to testify that the witness once perpetrated a hoax on an insurance company, for which she was convicted. The employee's testimony is:
240	In an automobile collision case brought by Poe against Davies, Poe introduced evidence that Ellis made an excited utterance that Davies ran the red light. Davies called Witt to testify that later Ellis, a bystander, now deceased, told Witt that Davies went through a yellow light. Witt's testimony should be
241	A defendant was charged with the murder of a victim. During the course of the criminal trial, a witness testified on behalf of the defense that, at the time the murder took place, he saw someone who looked like the defendant dancing at a local nightclub. The defendant is eventually acquitted of the charge. Following the acquittal, the appropriate survivors of the victim bring a wrongful death action against the defendant. As part of her defense, the defendant wishes to introduce the testimony given at the criminal trial by the witness. who the defendant shows is now incarcerated in a prison in another state. The testimony of the witness is:
242	After the release of various news stories about the President's possible violation of political campaign funding laws, a federal grand jury investigation and an investigation by a special Senate subcommittee were initiated. The Senate subcommittee subpoenaed documents and records from several top officers of the executive branch. Learning of the subpoenas, the President ordered all executive officials to refuse to turn over materials, claiming "executive privilege." Which of the following statements is most accurate?
243	An investor who owned several thriving shopping malls was negotiating to purchase a local mall from the company that currently owned it. A staff attorney for the state transportation department who shopped at the mall regularly learned of the negotiations and contacted the investor. The mall had deteriorated noticeably during the time the current company had owned it and the attorney believed that new ownership would revitalize the mall considerably. Although the attorney had no information to support this, she told the investor that the state was currently planning to construct a new interchange for the turnpike only three blocks from the mall. The investor went ahead with the purchase, believing that the new interchange would boost sales. In fact, no interchange was being considered by the state at that time, and nothing that the investor did after he purchased the mall could stem the decline in sales. He ended up selling the property at a substantial loss several years after the purchase. Does the investor have a cause of action against the attorney for his losses?
244	A businesswoman owned an office building. She sold the building to an investor, who paid her a fair price for the property. The investor failed to record the deed and left for an extended trip. Two days after he departed, the businesswoman died suddenly. Her will devised the office building to her daughter. The daughter knew nothing about the sale of the building to the investor, and she properly recorded her title to the building in the county recorder of deeds office. The daughter, who had no prior experience in business, applied to a lender for a $50,000 loan to start up her own business, offering a mortgage on the office building as collateral. The lender checked the recorder's records showing the daughter to have sole title to the building, and the loan and mortgage were executed. Unfortunately, the daughter's business failed and she was unable to repay her loan to the lender. The lender instituted foreclosure proceedings. Just as the building was about to be sold, the investor returned from his trip, deed in hand. The state in which the building is located has the following statute: "No conveyance or mortgage of an interest in land is valid against any subsequent purchaser for value without notice thereof, unless it is recorded." May the lender successfully take the office building?
245	In litigation over the estate of Baggs, who died intestate, Payton, who is eighteen years old, claimed to be Baggs's niece and entitled, therefore, to a share of his large estate. In support of her claim, Payton offered in evidence a Bible, properly identified as having belonged to Baggs's family, in the front of which was a list of family births, marriages, and deaths. The list recorded Payton's birth to Baggs's oldest sister. To prove that Payton is Baggs's niece, the Bible listing is
246	Parents purchased a new mobile home from Seller. The mobile home was manufactured by Mobilco and had a ventilating system designed by Mobilco with both a heating unit and an air conditioner. Mobilco installed a furnace manufactured by Heatco and an air conditioning unit manufactured by Coolco. Each was controlled by an independent thermostat installed by Mobilco. Because of the manner in which Mobilco designed the ventilating system, the first time the ventilating system was operated by Parents, cold air was vented into Parents' bedroom to keep the temperature at 68F (20'C). The cold air then activated the heater thermostat, and hot air was pumped into the bedroom of Child, the six-month-old child of Parents. The temperature in Child's room reached more than 170F (77'C) before Child's mother became aware of the condition and shut the system off manually. As a result, Child suffered permanent physical injury. Claims have been asserted by Child, through a duly appointed guardian, against Mobilco, Seller, Heatco, and Coolco. If Child's claims against Mobilco, Heatco, and Coolco are based on strict liability in tort, Child will probably recover against
247	Landco purchased a large tract of land intending to construct residential housing on it. Landco hired Poolco to build a large inground swimming pool on the tract. The contract provided that Poolco would carry out blasting operations that were necessary to create an excavation large enough for the pool. The blasting caused cracks to form in the walls of Plaintiff's home in a nearby residential neighborhood. In Plaintiff's action for damages against Landco, Plaintiff should
248	A husband and wife were installing a swimming pool in their backyard with help from a local handyman and a family friend when one of the pool's walls collapsed, injuring the handyman. The handyman sued the husband and wife on a negligence theory. The handyman's attorney seeks to have a paramedic who had responded to the accident testify that the family friend, who was a construction worker, made a statement to her that "I told the two of them that they needed more reinforcement in the concrete." The trial judge should rule this evidence:
249	Brill saved the life of Ace's wife, Mary, who thereafter changed her will to leave Brill $1,000. However, upon Mary's death she had no property except an undivided interest in real estate held in tenancy by the entirety of Ace. The property had been purchased by Ace from an inheritance. After Mary died, Ace signed and delivered to Brill the following instrument: "In consideration of Brill's saving my wife's life and his agreement to bring no claims against my estate based on her will, I hereby promise to pay Brill $1,000." Upon Ace's death, Brill filed a claim for $1,000. Ace's executor contested the claim on the ground that the instrument was not supported by sufficient consideration. In most states, would Brill's saving of Mary's life be regarded as sufficient consideration for Ace's promise?
250	A chef agreed in writing to lease a restaurant from the owner of the property. The term of the tenancy was two years, and rent was payable in monthly installments at the beginning of each month. At the end of the second year, there had been no discussions between the chef and the owner regarding renewal or termination. The chef did not vacate the premises at the end of the term; instead, she sent a check for the next month's rent to the owner. The owner cashed the check after the term had expired but informed the chef that his acceptance of the check did not mean that he was going to renew the lease or let the chef stay. At the end of that month, the owner seeks advice on whether he can evict the chef. How should the owner be advised to proceed?
251	An obsessive fan was heartbroken when her favorite actor announced his engagement to a well-known actress. The fan waited for the couple outside of a nightclub. When they arrived, the fan raised a gun and fired it at the actress, but as she fired, the actor's bodyguard spotted the gun and knocked it to one side. The bullet grazed the bodyguard's hand, causing minor injuries, and lodged in the actor's chest. Through prompt emergency medical treatment, the actor survived the shooting. The fan may be charged with attempted murder of:
252	A water pipe burst in the basement of Supermart, a grocery store, flooding the basement and damaging cases of canned goods on the floor. The Plumbing contractor's workmen, in repairing the leak, knocked over several stacks of canned goods in cases, denting the cans. After settling its claims against the landlord for the water leak and against the plumbing contractor for the damage done by his workmen, Supermart put the goods on special sale. Four weeks later Dotty was shopping in Supermart. Several tables in the market were covered with assorted canned foods, all of which were dirty and dented. A sign on each of the tables read: "Damaged Cans-Half Price." Dotty was having Guest for dinner that evening and purchased two dented cans of tuna, packed by Canco, from one of the tables displaying the damaged cans. Before Guest arrived, Dotty prepared a tuna casserole which she and Guest ate. Both became ill and the medical testimony established that the illness was caused by the tuna's being unfit for consumption. The tuna consumed by Dotty and Guest came from the case that was at the top of one of the stacks knocked over by the workmen. The tuna in undamaged cans from the same Canco shipment was fit for consumption. If Guest asserts a claim against Supermart, the most likely result is that Guest will
253	A state accredits both public and private schools, licenses their teachers, and supplies textbooks on secular subjects to all such schools. Country School. house, a private school that offers elementary and secondary education in the state, denies admission to all non-Caucasians. In a suit to enjoin as unconstitutional the continued racially exclusionary admissions policy of the Country Schoolhouse, which of the fol., lowing is the strongest argument AGAINST the school?
254	A mother brought her nine-year-old son to an indoor shopping mall. She was not planning on making any purchases that day, just spending some time with her son. When her son needed to use the men's restroom, his mother did some window shopping at the adjacent store. A child molester cornered the boy in the men's room and sexually molested him. The molester then quickly left the mall and has not been apprehended. The mother filed suit against the mall's owner on behalf of her son for the injuries he suffered. If the mall is found not liable, it will be because:
255	A homeowner purchased a ladder from a home supply retailer. While he was using the ladder, an improperly installed bolt fastening one of the rungs gave way, causing him to fall and break his leg. The homeowner sued the manufacturer of the ladder to recover damages for his injury. If it is established at trial that the home supply retailer could have discovered the defectively installed bolt if it had conducted a reasonable inspection of the ladder, the retailer's failure to inspect:
256	An employee of the United States Department of Labor was instructed by his superior to solicit subscriptions to the Department's bulletin on a door-to-door basis in the city in which he worked. While doing so, the employee was arrested for violation of a city ordinance that prohibited commercial solicitation of private residences. The employee's best defense is:
257	A child was injured when he was forcibly pulling on the safety harness in his highchair and the harness suddenly broke and snapped up, hitting him in his face. The highchair was manufactured overseas by a toy manufacturer and exported to the United States without the harness. When the highchair arrived in the United States, a company that makes safety equipment installed the harness on the highchair. The toy manufacturer had its factory representatives go to the safety company to inspect samples of the harness and conduct tests on a sample number of the highchairs after installation. The child's parents brought a negligence action against both the toy manufacturer and the safety company for his injuries. Evidence at trial shows that the toy manufacturer had conducted its normal tests with regard to the installations. The particular harness installed on the highchair, however, had some loose weaving that weakened the harness to the extent that it snapped from the child's continual pulling. Of the following, the best defense the toy manufacturer could assert against the parents is that:
258	Congress passed a law making it a crime to hunt a particular animal during certain months. The animal regularly migrated among several states and a federal wilderness area during the months that hunting was banned. One of the states adopted a statute allowing unlimited hunting of that animal during these months, because an overabundance of the animal was causing damage to the land. An entity that has been found to have standing in such matters filed an action in federal district court seeking to overturn the state statute. The district court most likely would declare the state statute to be:
259	A young woman went to her local shoe shop and selected a pair of shoes. She gave the salesperson cash for the shoes. As the salesperson was putting the shoes into a bag, a robber brandishing a gun entered the store, forced the salesperson to put all of the money in the register into the bag with the shoes, and fled with the bag, the money, and the shoes. After the police had come, the young woman asked the salesperson to get her another pair of shoes. He told the young woman that she would have to pay for them again. The young woman refused. If the young woman sues the shoe shop for another pair of shoes, who will prevail?
260	A fire broke out in a home that had been recently remodeled, destroying the house and injuring the homeowner. An investigation by the fire marshal established that the fire started from a short in some wiring behind a wall. A small section of wiring that ran to an outlet through a narrow gap between a furnace chimney and a hot water pipe had had part of its outer sheath cut off. The homeowner filed suit against the electrical company that did the rough wiring. The parties stipulated for trial that the company had installed the wiring in compliance with the blueprints, and that the wiring had been inspected and approved by the building inspector before the chimney and the water pipe had been installed and the walls put up, all by different contractors. At trial, the homeowner introduced the report of the fire marshal establishing how the fire started, and evidence of his medical expenses and other damages. At the end of the homeowner's case, the electrical company's attorney rested her case and moved for a directed verdict. The homeowner's attorney also moved for a directed verdict. How should the court rule on the directed verdict motions?
261	A privately held manufacturing corporation was the major employer in a local town. The chief executive officer ("CEO") of the marketing division of the corporation was a respected figure with a good reputation in the community. The CEO was suddenly fired by the executive vice president of the main corporation, prompting rumors in the town about the financial health of the marketing division. A reporter from the town newspaper interviewed the vice president and asked him why the CEO had been dismissed. The vice president said: "The CEO was fired because he was a bad manager and the marketing division lost money because of the CEO's stewardship." The vice president's statement was printed in the town newspaper, and was picked up by business-oriented publications. If the CEO sues the town newspaper for defamation, which of the following statements with regard to damages is correct?
262	A landowner's will left his ranch to a rancher, his heirs, and assigns, so long as the property was used exclusively for ranch purposes, then to the landowner's grandson. The remainder of the landowner's property passed through the residuary clause of his will to the grandson. Seven years after the landowner's death, the rancher began strip mining operations on the ranch. The grandson brought an action to quiet title to the ranch against the rancher, and the rancher counterclaimed on the same theory. Who should prevail?
263	The following facts concern a tract of land in a state which follows general United States law. Each instrument is in proper form, recorded, marital property rights were waived when necessary, and each person named was adult and competent at the time of the named transaction. 1. In 1940 Oleg, the owner, conveyed his interest in fee simple "to my brothers Bob and Bill, their heirs and assigns as joint tenants with right of survivorship." 2. In 1950 Bob died, devising his interest to his only child, "Charles, for life, and then to Charles's son, Sam, for life, and then to Sam's children, their heirs and assigns." 3. In 1970 Bill died, devising his interest "to my friend, Frank, his heirs and assigns." 4. In 1972 Frank conveyed by quitclaim deed "to Paul, his heirs and assigns whatever right, title and interest I own." Paul has never married. Paul has contracted to convey marketable record title in the land to Patrick. Can Paul do so?
264	A state statute makes it a felony for any teacher at a state institution of higher education to accept anything of value from a student at the same institution. Monroe, a student at the state university, offered Professor Smith, his English teacher, $50 in exchange for a good grade in his English course. Smith agreed and took the money. Professor Smith and Monroe are tried jointly for violation of the state statute. Professor Smith is charged with violating the statute and Monroe with aiding and abetting him. Monroe's best argument for a dismissal of the charge against him is that
265	A woman was injured when the car she was driving was struck by a moving truck. The woman brings an action for personal injuries against the moving company. The complaint alleges that the driver was drunk at the time of the accident and that the moving company was negligent in hiring him and permitting him to drive knowing that he had a drinking problem and convictions for drunk driving. The driver is called as a witness by the moving company and is expected to testify that he was not drunk at the time of the accident. Instead, the driver states on direct examination that he had had several beers as he drove his truck that evening and was under the influence of drugs when his truck struck the woman's car. The counsel for the moving company wants to confront the driver with his deposition testimony that he was completely sober at the time of the accident. Will this evidence be permitted?
266	A plaintiff was injured when the car she was driving was struck by a truck owned by the defendant and driven by its employee. The employee was just finishing his deliveries for the defendant when the accident occurred. At the scene of the accident, a bystander heard the employee say, "I can't believe it.. . I shouldn't have had all those beers." The plaintiff sued the defendant for her injuries and asked the bystander to testify at trial as to the employee's statement. The bystander's testimony should be ruled:
267	A company that owned a tract of land believed to be rich in mineral deposits contracted with a licensed excavator for the removal of soil from the property and delivery of the soil to the company's laboratories. While one of the excavator's trucks was on the way to the laboratory, the rear gate broke loose, dumping three tons of soil onto the highway. A motorist who was driving a short but safe distance behind the truck was unable to stop in time and collided with the soil, causing her serious injury. The rear gate had been negligently secured by one of the excavator's employees. If the motorist sues the company for his injuries and does not prevail, it will be because:
268	While on a hiking trip during the late fall, Page arrived, toward the end of the day, at a clearing where several similar cabins were located, none of which was occupied. One of the cabins belonged to Levin, Page's friend, who had given Page permission to use it. Page entered one of the cabins, which she thought was Levin's, and prepared to spend the night. In fact the cabin was owned, not by Levin, but by Dwyer. When the night turned cold, Page started a fire in the stove. Unknown to Page, there was a defect in the stove that allowed carbon monoxide fumes to escape into the cabin. During the night the fumes caused serious injury to Page. If Page asserts a claim against Dwyer for her injury, will Page recover?
269	A defendant was involved in an accident in which her car struck the rear end of the car driven by the plaintiff. The police issued tickets to the defendant, charging her with reckless driving and speeding. When the defendant's case came before the traffic court, her attorney entered into a plea bargain with the prosecutor. Under the plea bargain, the defendant agreed to plead guilty to speeding and to pay a fine of $100, and the prosecution agreed to drop the reckless driving charge. Accordingly, the defendant pleaded guilty and the court fined her $100. In the later civil suit, where the plaintiff is seeking damages from the defendant for personal injuries, is the guilty plea before the traffic court admissible?
270	An eight-year-old girl was playing catch on the sidewalk with her friend when her friend made an errant throw over the girl's head. The ball hit a pedestrian, who was walking on the sidewalk in the other direction. The pedestrian angrily threw the ball into the street. The girl ran out into the street to retrieve it and was hit and seriously injured by a car. If the girl's guardian brings an action on her behalf against the driver of the car, which of the following best states the pedestrian's liability?
271	An employer owned a tract of land in fee simple. As a bonus, the employer presented a deed conveying the tract to an employee. The deed was never recorded. Six months later, the employer found himself in dire financial straits and needed the tract back to complete its sale to a buyer. He asked the employee to please destroy the deed, which the employee dutifully and voluntarily did. Shortly thereafter, the employer and the employee were killed in an explosion in the factory where they both worked. Each of the successors in interest claim title to the tract. The probable outcome will be that:
272	Drew was tried for the July 21 murder of Victor. Drew called Warren to testify to alibi. On cross-examination of Warren, the prosecutor asked, "Weren't you on the jury that acquitted Drew of another criminal charge?" The best reason for sustaining an objection to this question is that
273	The owner of a sporting goods store noticed that her tent stock was running low. After consulting various manufacturers' catalogues, she decided to order from a large manufacturer of camping equipment whose catalogue listed the 9 x 12 tent that she wanted, at a cost of $70. On April 1, the store owner phoned the manufacturer and placed her order for 10 tents with the manufacturer's sales agent. The next day, the manufacturer mailed the store owner a letter informing her that the tents were now $72 and that they would be shipped to her on April 16. The store owner received the letter on April 4, but she never responded. On April 15, she received a catalogue from another tent company showing tents similar to the ones that she ordered, but for a cost of $50. She immediately called the manufacturer with whom she had placed her order to cancel it. Nevertheless, the manufacturer shipped the tents to her on April 16. If the manufacturer sues the store owner to enforce the contract, who will prevail?
274	A small print shop on the second floor of an older two-story industrial building kept its front door locked for security reasons, so most visitors gained access to the shop by using the shop's freight elevator in the rear of the building. This elevator did not have a call-button for use by the public, so anyone wanting to use it had to wait for one of the shop's employees to send down the elevator. A city fire inspector inspecting the building informed the shop foreman that he was going to inspect the lower floor, the trash area, and the elevator shaft. The foreman said that he would turn the elevator off until the inspector called up from downstairs that he was finished with his inspection. About 10 minutes later, as the inspector was under the elevator in the shaft, the freight elevator suddenly started descending. The inspector tried to get out of the way, but his leg was severed by the elevator. The inspector sued the print shop for the loss of his leg. At the time of the accident, there were three employees in the shop, but all deny that they pushed the button that would send the elevator to the first floor. Evidence at trial indicated that the foreman had turned the switch to "off" as he agreed to do. The inspector's expert testified that there was nothing wrong with the elevator that would cause it to malfunction and operate when it was turned off. The inspector most likely will:
275	To provide consistency in education in the state, a state law provides for the free distribution of textbooks on secular subjects to students in all public and private schools. A local private religious school accepts the secular textbooks for core academic subjects and supplements its students' education with religious texts. Which of the following is the strongest argument in favor of the constitutionality of free distribution of textbooks to the students at the private religious school?
276	Smith asked Jones if he would loan him $500, promising to repay the amount within two weeks. Jones loaned him the $500. The next day Smith took the money to the race track and lost all of it betting on horse races. He then left town for six months. He has not repaid Jones. Smith has committed
277	A police officer often visited an art gallery on his lunch break and became friends with one of the gallery's salespersons, whom he found to be honest and forthright. After hearing rumors that the gallery's owner sometimes dealt in stolen artwork, the officer decided to investigate. Acting without a warrant, he snuck into a back room and discovered various crates addressed to and from a country that was a well-known conduit for stolen artwork. The officer questioned his salesperson friend about the crates. She told the officer that she never saw what was inside any of the crates, but that she assumed they contained artwork for the owner's private collection that he maintained at home. The officer obtained a search warrant for the owner's home based on the foregoing information. Upon executing the warrant, the officer found several pieces of stolen artwork at the owner's home. The owner was subsequently tried for receiving stolen property. The salesperson was to be called to testify about what she knew about the gallery owner's activities related to the procurement of artwork. The salesperson's testimony will most likely be:
278	At a country auction, Powell acquired an antique cabinet that he recognized as a "Morenci," an extremely rare and valuable collector's item. Unfortunately, Powell's cabinet had several coats of varnish and paint over the original finish. Its potential value could only be realized if these layers could be removed without damaging the original finish. Much of the value of Morenci furniture depends on the condition of a unique oil finish, the secret of which died with Morenci, its inventor. A professional restorer of antique furniture recommended that Powell use Restorall to remove the paint and varnish from the cabinet. Powell obtained and read a sales brochure published by Restorall, Inc., which contained the following statement: "This product will renew all antique furniture. Will not damage original oil finishes." Powell purchased some Restorall and used it on his cabinet, being very careful to follow the accompanying instructions exactly. Despite Powell's care, the original Morenci finish was irreparably damaged. When finally refinished, the cabinet was worth less than 20% of what it would have been worth if the Morenci finish had been preserved. If Powell sues Restorall, Inc., to recover the loss he has suffered as a result of the destruction of the Morenci finish, will Powell prevail?
279	A state statute provides that no alien may own a restaurant within the state and that it is unlawful for anyone to give, sell, or otherwise convey a restaurant to an alien. A citizen of Canada who legally resides in the state has entered into a contract to buy a restaurant located within the state from a restaurant owner. If the buyer and the seller join in a declaratory judgment action to test the state statute in a federal court:
280	The owner of a one-acre parcel of land with a small house on it rented the property to a professor of a nearby college at a monthly rental of $500. Several years later, after the professor got tenure, the parties orally agreed that the professor would purchase the property from the owner for the sum of $60,000, payable at the rate of $500 a month for 10 years. They agreed that the owner would give the professor a deed to the property after five years had passed and $30,000 had been paid toward the purchase price, and that the professor would execute a note secured by a mortgage for the balance. The professor continued in possession of the property and made all monthly payments in a timely fashion. When he had paid $30,000, he tendered a proper note and mortgage to the property owner and demanded that she deliver the deed as agreed. The owner refused because valuable minerals had been discovered on adjacent parcels in recent months, causing the value of this parcel of land to increase to 10 times its former value. The professor brought suit against the property owner for specific performance. If the property owner wins, it will be because:
281	At an intersection of two busy streets, a motorcyclist failed to stop at a stop sign before entering the intersection. A truck driver who had the right of way saw the motorcycle crossing in front of him but was unable to stop because he had neglected to get his brakes repaired, even though he knew they were in poor condition. The two vehicles collided in the center of the intersection, injuring both parties. Immediately after that, a cabdriver who saw the accident decided to try to go around the vehicles, but she ended up colliding with both of them. All three parties were injured in the second collision. Each of the parties sues the other two in a jurisdiction that retains traditional contributory negligence rules. If the trier of fact finds that all three parties were at fault, which of the following is the most likely result?
282	A homeowner owned a parcel of land on which she built a single-family residence. To pay for the construction, she obtained financing from a bank in exchange for a mortgage on the land. The bank promptly and properly recorded its mortgage. When the house was completed, except for the absence of an oven in the kitchen, the homeowner leased the house to a tenant for a three-year term. There was no provision in the lease agreement regarding kitchen appliances. The homeowner bought an oven from an appliance company and had it installed in the space provided around the built-in cabinets in the kitchen. To make the purchase, the homeowner signed a security agreement with the appliance company granting it a security interest in the oven in exchange for financing. The appliance company did not file or record its security interest in the oven. By the end of the lease term, the homeowner was in serious default on her mortgage payments to the bank and to the appliance company. In preparing foreclosure proceedings against the homeowner, the bank learned that the tenant was planning to remove the oven and take it with him when he moved out within the next few weeks. The bank filed an action against the tenant claiming ownership of the oven, and joined the homeowner and the appliance company as parties. Which party has a superior claim to the oven?
283	In a will contest action, the decedent's children, who were not provided for in his will, claim that the decedent was not of sound mind at the time of executing the will. The plaintiffs' attorney calls as a witness the neighbor of the decedent, who was present when the will was executed but did not attest to the will. The attorney asks the neighbor to describe the decedent's mental state at the time of the will's execution. The neighbor states that the decedent appeared to be senile. The defense objects. How should the court rule?
284	Odum owned Brightacre (a tract of land) in fee simple. He conveyed it "to Pike, his heirs and assigns; but if Farley shall be living thirty years from the date of this deed, then to Farley, his heirs and assigns." The limitation "to Farley, his heirs and assigns" is
285	A shoplifter set a small fire in a store's trash basket. The shoplifter knew that the store's automatic sprinkler system would promptly douse the fire, but his purpose was merely to create a distraction so he could walk out with an expensive watch, which would constitute felony theft. The shoplifter was stopped after he set the fire but before he could take any merchandise. No serious damage was done to the store by the fire, but the flame charred the wall next to the trash basket and blistered the paint on the surrounding area. A statute in the jurisdiction extends the crime of arson to buildings other than dwellings. If the shoplifter is tried for the crime of arson, the court should find him:
286	In City of State Y, Maple Street is a local public thoroughfare, designated as a one-way street for northbound traffic. Pine Street is a public thoroughfare, designated is a One-way street for eastbound traffic. Maple and Pine Streets intersect at right angles. The intersection is controlled by traffic lights. There are two sets of lights, one at the northeast corner and one at the northwest corner, for traffic on Maple Street. There are two sets of lights, one at the northeast corner and one at the southeast corner, for traffic on Pine Street. Trucker was making a delivery to a market on the east side of Maple Street, just north of its intersection with Pine Street. There being insufficient space for his truck and enclosed trailer, he parked it with the rear of the trailer extending entirely across the crosswalk on the north side of the intersection. The height of the trailer was such that it entirely obscured the traffic light on the northeast corner from the vie" of traffic moving east on Pine Street. Unknown to Trucker, the traffic light at the southeast corner was not functioning, because a collision seventy-two hours earlier had knocked down the pole from which the light was suspended. Visitor, on his first trip to City, w as driving east on Pine Street. Not seeing any traffic light or pole, he entered the intersection at a time when the light was red for eastbound traffic and green for northbound traffic. Driver, proceeding north on Maple Street and seeing the green light, entered the intersection without looking for any cross traffic and struck Visitor's car. Driver received personal injuries, and Visitor's car was damaged severely as a result of the impact. Statutes of State Y make it a misdemeanor (1) to park a motor vehicle so that any part projects into a crosswalk and (2) to enter an intersection contrary to a traffic signal. If Driver asserts a claim against Trucker and establishes that Trucker was negligent, the likely result is that Trucker',s negligence is
287	While testifying as a witness in a civil trial, Walters was asked on cross-examination if he had been convicted in the circuit court of Jasper County of stealing $200 from his employer on August 16, 1977. Walters said, "No, I have never been convicted of any crime." In fact, Walters had pleaded guilty to such a charge and had been placed on probation. Walters was then charged with perjury on the ground that his statement denying the conviction was false. A statute in the jurisdiction defines perjury as knowingly making a false statement while under oath. At trial, the state proved Walters' statement and the prior conviction. Walters testified that the attorney who represented him in the theft case had told him that, because he had been placed on probation, he had not been convicted of a crime. Walters had served his probationary period satisfactorily and been discharged from probation. The alleged advice of the attorney was incorrect. If the jury believes Walters, it should find him
288	Mermaid owns an exceptionally seaworthy boat that she charters for sport fishing at a $500 daily rate. The fee includes the use of the boat with Mermaid as the captain, and one other crew member, as well as fishing tackle and bait. On May 1, Phinney agreed with Mermaid that Phinney would have the full-day use of the boat on May 15 for himself and his family for $500. Phinney paid an advance deposit of $200 and signed an agreement that the deposit could be retained by Mermaid as liquidated damages in the event Phinney canceled or failed to appear. For this question only, assume the following facts. On May 15 at 1 a.m., the Coast Guard had issued offshore "heavy weather" warnings and prohibited all small vessels the size of Mermaid's from leaving the harbor. This prohibition remained in effect throughout the day. Phinney did not appear at all on May 15, because he had heard the weather warnings on his radio. Which of the following is an accurate statement?
289	Detective received informal from Informant, who had given reliable information many times in the past, that Harry was a narcotics dealer. Specifically, Informant said that, two months before, he had visited Harry's apartment with Bill and that on that occasion he saw Harry sell Bill some heroin. Detective knew that Informant, Harry, and Bill were friends. Thereafter, Detective put all this information into affidavit form, appeared before a magistrate, and secured a search warrant for Harry's apartment. The search turned up a supply of heroin. Harry's motion to suppress introduction of the heroin into evidence will most probably be
290	Sue Starr, a minor both in fact and appearance, bought on credit and took delivery of a telescope from 30-year-old Paul Prism for an agreed price of $100. Upon reaching her majority soon thereafter, Starr encountered Prism and said, "I am sorry for not having paid you that $100 for the telescope when the money was due, but I found out it was only worth $75. So I now promise to pay you $75." Starr subsequently repudiated this promise and refused to pay Prism anything. In an action for breach of contract by Prism against Starr, Prism's probable recovery is
291	An engineering firm was having difficulty finding qualified engineers because most universities could not afford the costly hardware needed to train top engineering students. The firm's president wrote a letter to the dean of a highly respected university in the area, offering to provide, at cost, "all the necessary electronic drafting tables your university needs" for use in its engineering degree program. The dean received the letter and immediately mailed an acceptance. Two weeks later, before the dean had taken any other action, he received another letter from the firm president explaining that the firm was in the midst of an unforeseen financial crisis and it could not provide the drafting tables to the university at cost after all. If the dean, on the university's behalf, brings an action for breach of contract against the engineering firm, who will prevail?
292	A professional baseball player visited a sick boy in the hospital. The player told the boy that in consideration of the boy's courage, he would hit a home run for him in his next game. As the player was leaving the hospital, the boy's father stopped the player and told him how important the home run could be in improving his son's spirits and health. The father told the player he would pay him $5,000 if he did hit a home run in his next game. The player agreed and took extra batting practice before his next game to improve his chances. In his next game, the player hit two home runs. The player's contract with his ball club does not forbid him from accepting money from fans for good performance. The player has now asked the father for the $5,000. If the father refuses to pay and the baseball player brings an action against him for damages, which of the following is correct under the prevailing modern rule in contract law?
293	Ven owned Goldacre, a tract of land, in fee simple. Ven and Pur entered into a written agreement under which Pur agreed to buy Goldacre for $100,000, its fair market value. The agreement contained all the essential terms of a real estate contract to sell and buy, including a date for closing. The required $50,000 down payment was made. The contract provided that in the event of Pur's breach, Ven could retain the $50,000 deposit as liquidated damages. Before the date set for the closing in the contract, Pur died. On the day that Addy was duly qualified as administratrix of the estate of Pur, which was after the closing date, Addy made demand for return of the $50,000 deposit. Ven responded by stating that he took such demand to be a declaration that Addy did not intend to complete the contract and that Ven considered the contract at an end. Ven further asserted that Ven was entitled to retain, as liquidated damages, the $50,000. The reasonable market value of Goldacre had increased to $110,000 at that time. Addy brought an appropriate action against Ven to recover the $50,000. In answer, Ven made no affirmative claim but asserted that he was entitled to retain the $50,000 as liquidated damages as provided in the contract. In such lawsuit, judgment should be for
294	During the trial of a personal injury case, the plaintiff calls a witness to testify that he saw the defendant spill a slippery substance in the roadway. Following the testimony of the witness, the defendant calls the witness's neighbor, who testifies that the witness has a poor reputation for truthfulness in the community. The plaintiff's attorney then crossexamines the neighbor, asking her, in good faith, if she committed the crime of false pretenses last year. Last year, the neighbor had in fact been charged with and convicted of the crime of false pretenses. The defendant's attorney objects to this question. The objection should be:
295	Peri sues Denucci for a libelous letter received by Investigator. The authenticity and contents of the letter are disputed. Peri's attorney asks Investigator to testify that, a week before receiving the libelous letter, he had written to Denucci inquiring about Peri. The testimony is
296	Jack and Paul planned to hold up a bank. They drove to the bank in Jack's car. Jack entered while Paul remained as lookout in the car. After a few moments, Paul panicked and drove off. Jack looked over the various tellers, approached one and wispered nervously, "Just hand over the cash. Don't look around, don't make a false move-or it's your life." The teller looked at the fidgeting Jack, laughed, flipped him a dollar bill and said, "Go on, beat it." Flustered, Jack grabbed the dollar and left. Soon after leaving the scene, Paul was stopped by the police for speeding. Noting his nervous condition, the police asked Paul if they might search the car. Paul agreed. The search turned up heroin concealed in the lid of the trunk. The prosecution's best argument to sustain the validity of the search of Jack's car would be that
297	Able conveyed Blackacre to Baker by a warranty deed. Baker recorded the deed four days later. After the conveyance but prior to Baker's recording of the deed, Smollett properly filed a judgment against Able. The two pertinent statutes in the jurisdiction provide the following: 1) any judgment properly filed shall, for ten years from filing, be a lien on the real property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person against whom the judgment is rendered, and 2) no conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value and without notice unless the same be recorded according to law. The recording act has no provision for a grace period. Smollett joined both Able and Baker in an appropriate action to foreclose the judgment lien against Blackacre. If Smollett is unsuccessful, it will be because
298	A landlord leased residential property to a tenant. The written lease was for a period of one year, with the monthly rent of $1,000 payable on or before the first of each month. The termination date set out in the lease was October 1. On August 10 of the first year of her tenancy, the tenant received a letter from the landlord along with a new lease form. The lease was for a period to terminate on October 1 of the following year, and the rent stated in the new lease was $1,200 per month. Both the rent increase and the notice given were in full compliance with relevant state statutes. An accompanying letter, signed by the landlord, asked the tenant to sign the lease on the line marked "tenant." On September 15, the tenant sent the lease back to the landlord unsigned. On September 20, the tenant sent a letter to the landlord by certified mail. The landlord signed the return receipt, which the post office duly sent to the tenant. Enclosed with the tenant's letter was a check for $1,000 for "next month's rent." The landlord deposited the check into his bank account. With the landlord's acquiescence, the tenant remained in possession after October 1. Which of the following statements is most accurate?
299	A pedestrian was in a hurry and he crossed the street in the middle of the block rather than walking to the corner crosswalk. A police officer stopped the pedestrian and asked to see his driver's license. The pedestrian did not have a driver's license. When he told the officer this, she said, "All right, I'm taking you in for jaywalking," and seized his wrist, twisting it up and behind him in a personnel control lock. A black belt in judo, the pedestrian easily slipped the officer's grasp. The officer pulled her baton from her belt and attempted to strike the pedestrian, who moved swiftly to the side, chopped at her arm, and caused the baton to fall from her grasp to the pavement. At that point two other officers arrived on the scene and arrested the pedestrian. Jaywalking (crossing a street outside of a crosswalk or not at an intersection) is punishable in the jurisdiction by a fine. There is no other applicable statute. If the pedestrian brings an action against the first officer for battery, what is the probable outcome?
300	A grand jury was investigating a bank robbery. The only information known to the prosecutor was a rumor that a certain ex-convict might have been involved. The grand jury subpoenaed the ex-convict. He refused to answer questions about the robbery and was granted use immunity. He then testified that he and a friend had robbed the bank. The grand jury indicted both the ex-convict and his friend for the bank robbery. The prosecutor permitted the friend to enter a plea to a lesser offense in exchange for the friend's agreement to testify against the ex-convict. The prosecutor had no evidence as to the identity of the robbers except the testimony of the friend and the ex-convict. At the ex-convict's trial, his objection to his friend's being permitted to testify should be:
301	A landowner owned a large parcel of land that he divided into two equal parcels. Thirty years ago, the landowner deeded the eastern parcel to a purchaser by warranty deed, including an easement over the south 25 feet of the western parcel for access to the navigable river that ran along the westerly boundary of the western parcel. The landowner acknowledged the deed and easement, and the purchaser recorded the document. The recording officer maintains an alphabetical grantor-grantee index, but no tract index. The purchaser made no use of the easement until five years ago, one year after her neighbor had purchased the western parcel from the landowner. The neighbor had paid at least market value for the western parcel and was not aware of the purchaser's easement. The neighbor objected to the purchaser's use of the easement shortly after she began using it, but the purchaser paid no attention. The neighbor sues the purchaser to quiet his title and to restrain the purchaser from using the easement over the western parcel. The purchaser has reasonable access to a public highway on the easterly boundary of the eastern parcel. If the purchaser is successful, it will be because:
302	A man went to his local sporting goods store and told the salesperson that he wanted a tennis racket that was very high-end. The salesperson showed him a racket that he said was made of the finest titanium and would probably last for years. The man bought the racket and left the store. After playing with the racket for three days, it suddenly snapped in two when he hit a hard shot. He showed it to the tennis pro at his club, who informed him that the racket was painted plastic. If the man sues the sporting goods store for a refund, under which theory would he most likely prevail?
303	Tenant rented a commercial building from Landlord, and operated a business in it. The building's large front window was smashed by vandals six months before expiration of the Tenant-Landlord lease. Tenant, who was obligated thereunder to effect and pay for repairs in such cases, promptly contracted with Glazier to replace the window for $2,000, due 30 days after satisfactory completion of the work. Landlord was then unaware of the Tenant-Glazier contract. Glazier was aware that the building was under lease, but dealt entirely with Tenant. Sixty days after Glazier's satisfactory completion of the window replacement, and prior to the expiration of Tenant's lease, Tenant, then insolvent, ceased doing business and vacated the building. In so doing, Tenant forfeited under the lease provisions its right to the return of a $2,000 security deposit with Landlord. The deposit had been required, however, for the express purpose (as stated in the lease) of covering any damage to the leased property except ordinary wear and tear. The only such damage occurring during Tenant's occupancy was the smashed window. Glazier's $2,000 bill for the window replacement is wholly unpaid. Assuming that Glazier has no remedy quasi in rem under the relevant state mechanic's lien statute, which of the following would provide Glazier's best chance of an effective remedy in personam against Landlord?
304	Congress enacted a statute, over the President's veto, that granted Congress the power to compel the President to remove United States troops from foreign territory when such troops have for 60 days been engaged in hostilities and there has been no formal declaration of war. The statute also provided that Congress may force the President to withdraw the troops before the 60 days have elapsed by a two-thirds majority vote of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to that effect. Which of the following statements best describes the likely result of judicial review of the constitutional validity of this statute?
305	Drew was tried for the July 21 murder of Victor. In his case in chief, Drew called as his first witness Wilma to testify to Drew's reputation in his community as "a peaceable man." The testimony is
306	The defendant was on trial for the crime of reckless homicide after allegedly running over the victim with his car and killing him. The defendant testified that he was not driving recklessly. Defense counsel wants to call to the stand the defendant's colleague, who regularly shares rides with the defendant to and from work, to testify to his reputation for careful driving and for truthfulness. Should the testimony be admitted?
307	Phillips purchased a suit of thermal underwear manufactured by Makorp from synthetic materials. While he was attempting to stamp out a fire, Phillips' thermal underwear caught fire and burned in a melting fashion up to his waist. He suffered a heart attack a half hour later. In a suit against Makorp, Phillips alleged that negligence and breach of warranty caused both the burn and the heart attack. Phillips testified to the fpregoing. Phillips testified that his purchase of the underwear occurred on April 17th, a fact of minor importance in the case. He stated that he could identify the date because his secretary had taken the day off to attend the first game of the baseball season and he had checked his company's payroll records to verify the date. Makorp moves to strike the testimony as to the date. The motion should be
308	A driver and his passenger were involved in an accident with another car. They consulted a lawyer regarding their claim and decided to file a suit against the other driver. The lawyer's paralegal attended the consultation. The passenger subsequently sued the driver on a cross-complaint. Prior to trial, the paralegal left the lawyer's employ. At trial, the driver's lawyer called his former employee, the paralegal, to take the stand. The paralegal will testify regarding the passenger's statements to the lawyer at the initial consultation that he was arguing with the driver at the time of the collision. The testimony is:
309	A landowner conveyed her property "to my only daughter, her heirs and assigns, as long as the premises are used for noncommercial purposes, then to my only grandson, his heirs and assigns." The jurisdiction in which the property is located follows the common law Rule Against Perpetuities. The landowner's interest in the property, if any, is:
310	Sal owned five adjoining rectangular lots, numbered 1 through 5 inclusive, all fronting on Main Street. All of the lots are in a zone limited to one- and two-family residences under the zoning ordinance. Two years ago, Sal conveyed Lots 1, 3, and 5. None of the three deeds contained any restrictions. Each of the new owners built a one-family residence. One year ago, Sal conveyed Lot 2 to Peter. The deed provided that each of Peter and Sal, their respective heirs and assigns, would use Lots 2 and 4 respectively only for one-family residential purposes. The deed was promptly and properly recorded. Peter built a one-family residence on Lot 2. Last month, Sal conveyed Lot 4 to Betty. The deed contained no restrictions. The deed from Sal to Peter was in the title report examined by Betty's lawyer. Betty obtained a building permit and commenced construction of a two- family residence on Lot 4. Peter, joined by the owners of Lots 1, 3, and 5, brought an appropriate action against Betty to enjoin the proposed use of Lot 4, or, alternatively, damages caused by Betty's breach of covenant. Which is the most appropriate comment concerning the outcome of this action?
311	A developer contracted to buy a parcel of land from a landowner, with deed to be delivered and money paid on August 1. The developer planned to build a high-rise building on the land. The developer had visually inspected the land, but did not take any special notice of the fact that a stream flowed up to the eastern property line of the land and reappeared just beyond the western property line. In fact, there was a conduit under the surface of the land through which the waters of the stream were diverted. On July 28, one of the developer's friends mentioned the existence of the conduit to the developer. When the landowner tendered a deed to the land on August I, the developer refused to accept it, stating that she would not have tried to buy the land if she had known about the conduit. The landowner files suit, demanding performance by the developer or damages for breach. Who should prevail?
312	A state statute reads in pertinent part: "Any licensed medical doctor who willfully neglects to assist anyone with a life-threatening injury shall be guilty of a crime, subject to punishment of up to two years' imprisonment in the state penitentiary or a fine of $15,000, or both." A licensed physician, while jogging in a park, heard the sounds of a man moaning in the bushes next to the jogging path. The physician stopped to investigate and found the man bleeding in the bushes. The physician asked the man if he needed help, and the man responded that he would be fine. Not having seen any indications of a serious condition, the physician returned to her morning jog. The man subsequently bled to death an hour later. The coroner's report made clear that the man could have been saved if he had received prompt medical attention, even if only of a "first aid" variety until an ambulance arrived. The physician was charged with violating the statute. At trial, the physician testified that she was unaware of the statute, which had been in effect for one week when the incident took place. Should the physician be convicted of violating the statute?
313	A bartender and a patron were arguing over an upcoming football game. Their argument grew heated, and the bartender reached over the bar and pushed the patron's shoulder. Enraged, the patron picked up a beer bottle, smashed it, and lunged over the bar. He pinned the bartender against the wall and swung the broken glass toward the bartender's throat. The bartender managed to grab a baseball bat he kept hidden under the bar and hit the patron, causing the patron to fall and strike his head on the edge of a table. The patron died as a result and the bartender was charged with manslaughter in a jurisdiction that recognizes the "imperfect self-defense" doctrine. Should the bartender's claim of self-defense succeed?
314	A plaintiff brought a civil action against a defendant for embezzlement of funds missing from a trust account, for which the defendant also is being investigated by the district attorney. At trial, the plaintiff calls the defendant as an adverse witness and asks him one question, "Is it not true that you embezzled funds from the trust?" The defendant refuses to answer, claiming a privilege against self-incrimination. The trial court should:
315	Aris was the owner in fee simple of adjoining lots known as Lot 1 and Lot 2. He built a house in which he took up residence on Lot 1. Thereafter, he built a house on Lot 2, which he sold, house and lot, to Baker. Consistent with the contract of sale and purchase, the deed conveying Lot 2 from Aris to Baker contained the following clause: In the event Baker, his heirs or assigns, decide to sell the property hereby conveyed and obtain a purchaser ready, willing, and able to purchase Lot 2 and the improvements thereon on terms and conditions acceptable to Baker, said Lot 2 and improvements shall be offered to Aris, his heirs or assigns, on the same terms and conditions. Aris, his heirs or assigns, as the case may be, shall have ten days from said offer to accept said offer and thereby to exercise said option. Three years after delivery and recording of the deed and payment of the purchase price, Baker became ill and moved to a climate more compatible with his health. Baker's daughter orally offered to purchase the premises from Baker at its then fair market value. Baker declined his daughter's offer but instead deeded Lot 2 to his daughter as a gift. Immediately thereafter, Baker's daughter sold Lot 2 to Charles at the then fair market value of Lot 2. The sale was completed by the delivery of deed and payment of the purchase price. At no time did Baker or his daughter offer to sell Lot 2 to Aris. Aris learned of the conveyance to Baker's daughter and the sale by Baker's daughter to Charles one week after the conveyance of Lot 2 from Baker's daughter to Charles. Aris promptly brought an appropriate action against Charles to enforce rights created in him by the deed of Aris to Baker. Aris tendered the amount paid by Charles into the court for whatever disposition the court deemed proper. The common-law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified by statute. Which of the following will determine whether Aris will prevail? I. The parol evidence rule. II. The Statute of Frauds. III. The type of recording statute of the jurisdiction in question. IV. The Rule Against Perpetuities.
316	Smith joined a neighborhood gang. At a gang meeting, as part of the initiation process, the leader ordered Smith to kill Hardy, a member of a rival gang. Smith refused, saying he no longer wanted to be part of the group. The leader, with the approval of the other members, told Smith that he had become too involved with the gang to quit and that they would kill him if he did not accomplish the murder of Hardy. The next day Smith shot Hardy to death while Hardy was sitting on his motorcycle outside a restaurant. Smith is charged with first-degree murder. First-degree murder is defined in the jurisdiction as the intentional premeditated killing of another. Second-degree murder is all other murder at common law. If Smith killed Hardy because of the threat to his own life, Smith should be found
317	A city ordinance required that all dogs be leashed when taken outside of an enclosed area. One dog owner often allowed his dog to run loose in front of his house. One clear and sunny day when the dog was running loose, a pizza delivery driver was driving carefully on that street at a speed somewhat below the posted limit. The dog dashed out into the street from between two parked cars. The delivery driver alertly applied her brakes, but could not avoid striking the dog. A man driving directly behind the delivery driver promptly applied his brakes as soon as he saw the delivery driver brake. However, the man's vehicle struck the rear of the delivery driver's car. Both of the vehicles suffered damage and both drivers suffered minor personal injuries. If the man sues the delivery driver for his vehicle damage and personal injuries, the man will:
318	An owner of a 60-acre parcel of land bordered by a lake on its east side sold the western 50 acres to a fisherman. The recorded deed recited that the fisherman, his heirs and assigns had the right to use the single lane gravel road to the lake that ran along the southern border of the owner's property. Subsequently, the fisherman died and his son inherited the 50-acre parcel. The son wishes to build a resort on the property but would need to pave and widen the lake road so it could bear the increased traffic. The owner files an action for declaratory judgment seeking to enjoin improvement of the road. If the owner prevails, it will be because: SET 4 MIXED SUBJECT 143.
319	A landowner and his friend owned a tract of land as joint tenants with right of survivorship. The landowner executed a deed conveying his interest in the land to his grandson. The landowner gave the deed to his attorney with instructions to deliver it to the grandson upon the landowner's death. The grandson first learned of the deed at the landowner's funeral the following year. The next day, the grandson recorded the deed. Who owns the land?
320	The owner of farmland entered into a written contract with a prospective tenant of the property to erect a barn with a milking station and silo on the property in exchange for the tenant's taking a five-year lease on the property. After the agreement was signed, the tenant moved himself and his family onto the property. The farm owner, who had worked for many years as a skilled building contractor before retiring, began the work of building the barn and the silo. However, an injury prevented him from completing the job when it was about two-thirds done. He told the tenant that he would see to it that the work was completed and that he had already entered into an oral contract with his nephew, a novice contractor, to finish the job. However, the nephew failed to complete the job. The tenant brought an action against the nephew for breach of contract. Which would be the best defense for the nephew?
321	A woman was the subject of a murder investigation. The investigation continued for more than two years, with the woman frequently being called in for questioning. Finally, the woman was indicted for the murder. The woman's lawyer filed a motion to dismiss all charges against her, arguing that the excessively long investigatory period violated the woman's constitutional right to a speedy trial. Despite the pending motion, the woman decided that she wanted to "get it over with," and she told the judge that she wished to plead guilty. The judge then explained the charges to the woman and asked her if she understood them. She replied, "Yes." The judge then asked the woman if she understood that she was not required to plead guilty. She responded in the affirmative. Finally, the judge described the maximum sentence and asked the woman if she understood that she could receive the maximum sentence, which was life imprisonment. She again responded, "Yes," and maintained that she still wished to plead guilty. The judge accepted the woman's plea and sentenced her to 30 years' imprisonment in the state penitentiary. Six months later, the woman filed a motion to set aside the guilty plea. Which of the following provides the best argument that the woman has a constitutional basis for relief?
322	Two brothers were playing golf when the elder brother left to take a telephone call. When he returned, he told the younger brother, "My wife was just involved in an accident. She ran a red light and hit another car. I need to leave." After arriving at the scene of the accident, the elder brother, after talking with bystanders, determined that his wife had not driven through a red light. The driver of the other car brought suit against the wife for injuries suffered in the accident. To help establish liability, the driver of the other car seeks to have the younger brother testify as to the elder brother's statements on the golf course. The younger brother's testimony is:
323	An entrepreneur purchased a piece of undeveloped land with plans to build a luxury spa. He financed the purchase with a loan from a bank, secured by a mortgage on the land. The land contained a mineral hot spring. The entrepreneur hired builders to harness the spring's water into a soaking pool. The spa was not a success and the entrepreneur ran out of money. He entered into a contract that purported to transfer his inventory and all his interests in the soaking pool to a buyer by a document that was sufficient as a bill of sale to transfer personal property but was insufficient as a deed to transfer real property. The bank soon after foreclosed on its mortgage and the land was sold at auction to a bidder, who took title in fee simple. Title to the soaking pool is in:
324	The defendant is being sued under a federal statute that allows an action for damages by victims of domestic violence committed on military bases or other federal land. The lawsuit stems from the alleged longtime physical abuse of the eight-year-old daughter of the defendant's live-in girlfriend. At trial in federal court, the plaintiff, the girl's legal guardian, calls as a witness the physician who treated the girl for her injuries. The plaintiff seeks to have the doctor testify that, during his treatment of the girl, he told her that in order to treat her injuries properly, he needed to know how she received her injuries and the length of time that her condition had existed. The doctor will testify that the girl told him that the defendant had beaten her, and that the beatings had taken place fairly regularly for several months. The doctor's testimony is:
325	Davison was driving through an apartment building area plagued with an unusually high incidence of burglaries and assaults. Acting pursuant to a police department plan to combat crime by the random stopping of automobiles in the area between midnight and 6:00 a.m., a police officer stopped Davison and asked him for identification. As Davison handed the officer his license, the officer directed a flashlight into the automobile and saw what appeared to be the barrel of a shotgun protruding from under the front seat on the passenger side of the car. The officer ordered Davison from the car, searched him, and discovered marijuana cigarettes and a shotgun. At Davison's trial for unlawful possession of narcotics, his motion to suppress the use of the marijuana as evidence should be
326	The plaintiff brought suit against his former boss for a libelous letter received by the plaintiff's present employer. The former boss allegedly sent the letter. The authenticity and contents of the letter are disputed at the jury trial. In response to a question from the plaintiff's attorney, the present employer states that: "I received a letter from the plaintiff's former boss, which I seem to have lost, but I remember exactly what it said." The plaintiff's present employer will be allowed to testify as to the contents of the letter if:
327	While waiting for a flight, a passenger noticed that whenever a bearded man with a large valise passed close to her suitcase, the Geiger counter inside, which she used in her research to detect small amounts of radiation, would tick. The passenger informed the airport police, who quickly accosted the bearded man, a medical technician. His suitcase contained some expensive radioactive isotopes used in treating certain forms of cancer. The police were aware that the same type of isotopes had been reported missing from a hospital a few days earlier. The medical technician was charged under a federal statute making it a crime to transport radioactive materials without a license. At the trial, an expert witness testifies as to how the Geiger counter operates. Next, the prosecutor calls the passenger to testify regarding the reaction of the Geiger counter to the medical technician's presence. The testimony will be allowed only if the prosecution shows:
328	An investor financed the purchase of a parcel of land with a $500,000 loan from a bank, secured by a mortgage on the land. After an unsuccessful search to find a developer to subdivide and build homes on the land, the investor leased the existing home to a tenant for five years. During the fourth year of the lease, the investor defaulted on the bank loan. The bank brought a foreclosure action, joining the investor and the tenant in the proceeding. The land was sold to a buyer at the foreclosure sale for the outstanding amount of the loan. After the buyer obtained a judgment in an ejectment action against the tenant, the tenant brought an appropriate action for damages against the investor. As between the tenant and the investor, for whom should the court rule?
329	A proposed federal statute would prohibit all types of discrimination against black persons on the basis of their race in every business transaction executed anywhere in the United States by any person or entity, governmental or private. Is this proposed federal statute likely to be constitutional?
330	A gambler lived in a state where gambling was illegal. Nevertheless, he gambled on a regular basis. He asked his friend to lend him $5,000 to bet on a football game. His friend agreed to lend him $5,000 if the gambler would bet half of it on the friend's behalf. The gambler agreed, took his friend's $5,000, and placed the bet. The gambler won on 4-to-l odds. He gave his friend his $5,000 back but refused to tender any winnings. If his friend sues the gambler to recover the winnings due under the contract, who will prevail?
331	Pauline and Doris own adjacent parcels of land. On each of their parcels was a low-rise office building. The two office buildings were of the same height. Last year Doris decided to demolish the lowrise office building on her parcel and to erect a new high-rise office building of substantially greater height on the parcel as permitted by the zoning and building ordinances. She secured all the governmental approvals necessary to pursue her project. As Doris's new building was in the course of construction, Pauline realized that the shadows it would create would place her (Pauline's) building in such deep shade that the rent she could charge for space in her building would be substantially reduced. Pauline brought an appropriate action against Doris to enjoin the construction in order to eliminate the shadow problem and for damages. Pauline presented uncontroverted evidence that her evaluation as to the impact of the shadow on the fair rental value of her building was correct. There is no statute or ordinance (other than the building and zoning ordinances) that is applicable to the issues before the court. The court should
332	Defendant was put on trial for robbery and aggravated battery. Despite having been seriously injured in the attack, the victim took the witness stand and identified the defendant as his attacker. The first trial ended in a hung jury on both charges, and the victim died shortly thereafter from his injuries. The district attorney then charged the defendant with felony murder. At the trial on that charge, the prosecution offers into evidence the victim's testimony at the first trial identifying the defendant as his assailant. The defendant's attorney immediately objects. The objection should be:
333	David owned a shotgun that he used for hunting. David knew that his old friend, Mark, had become involved with a violent gang that recently had a shoot-out with a rival gang. David, who was going to a farm to hunt quail, placed his loaded shotgun on the back seat of his car. On his way to the farm, David picked up Mark to give him a ride to a friend's house. After dropping off Mark at the friend's house, David proceeded to the farm, where he discovered that his shotgun was missing from his car. Mark had taken the shotgun and, later in the day, Mark used it to shoot Paul, a member of the rival gang. Paul was severely injured. Paul recovered a judgment for his damages against David, as well as Mark, on the ground that David was negligent in allowing Mark to obtain possession of the gun, and was therefore liable jointly and severally with Mark for Paul's damages. The jurisdiction has a statute that allows contribution based upon proportionate fault and adheres to the traditional common-law rules on indemnity. If David fully satisfies the judgment, David then will have a right to recover from Mark
334	Two states that permit the hunting and trapping of snipe are separated from each other by a middle state that strictly forbids it in order to protect snipe, a rare species of animal, from extinction. A middle state statute provides, "Possession of snipe traps is prohibited. Any game warden finding a snipe trap within the state shall seize and destroy it." A snipe hunter from the one state that permitted trapping traveled across the middle state to purchase a new snipe trap from a manufacturer in the other state that permitted it. On the way back with the trap in her car, she stopped in a state park in the middle state to camp. A game warden saw the trap on the front seat of her car. The warden seized the trap and destroyed it in accordance with the state statute after the hunter admitted that the seized item was a prohibited snipe trap. The hunter challenges the application of the statute to her on the basis of a denial of equal protection. The hunter has demonstrated that common carriers are permitted to transport snipe traps as cargo across the middle state for delivery to another state and that, in practice, the statute is enforced only against private individuals transporting those traps in private vehicles. No federal statutes or federal administrative regulations apply. Application of the statute to the hunter will probably be found:
335	A mother purchased 80 acres of desert land over 30 years ago. The deed was properly recorded. Although her family had never even visited the land, the mother had described to them the little two-room cabin that sat in the middle of the parcel near the dry streambed. Ten years ago, the mother's son found what he was certain was the little cabin, and over the next few years he built a barn, a greenhouse, and some corrals, all enclosed by a sturdy wire mesh fence. The area bounded by the fence, containing all the structures, occupied about two acres of the 80 owned by the mother. Three years ago, the mother died, validly devising the 80 acres to the son. The son entered into a contract for sale of the two acres, describing it in detail with reference to the structures and nearby landmarks. The purchaser's surveyor discovered that the son had settled onto a completely different parcel from the one owned by the mother. The purchaser immediately announced that he would not proceed with the sale contract. The state's statutory period for establishing adverse possession is five years. If the son brings an action for specific performance of the sale contract, for whom should the court rule?
336	After being notified by Dr. Josephs that Nurse Norris' employment with his office was terminated, Norris applied for a position with Hospital. In her application, Norris listed her former employment with Josephs. Josephs, in response to a telephone inquiry from Hospital, stated that "Norris lacked professional competence." Although Josephs believed that to be a fair assessment of Norris, his adverse rating was based on one episode of malpractice for which he blamed Norris but which in fact was chargeable to another doctor. Because of Josephs' adverse comment on her qualifications, Norris was not employed by Hospital. If Norris asserts a claim based on defamation against Josephs, will Norris prevail?
337	A boater taking his new powerboat out on a large lake ran out of gas because of a defective seal in the gas tank. The defect was not discoverable by an ordinary inspection. His frantic signaling alerted the captain of a sightseeing boat passing by. The captain pulled up alongside to assist and attempted to restart the boat. A spark ignited a pool of gas that had leaked from the gas tank and collected in the lower part of the boat, causing an explosion and fire. The captain was severely burned and died from his injuries. The captain's estate brought a wrongful death action based on strict liability against the powerboat dealer and the manufacturer. Evidence at trial established that the dealer had sold the manufacturer's boats for years without any problems reported by customers. Can the captain's estate recover any damages from the dealer?
338	Congress passed a law mandating standards for hybrid automobiles in an effort to encourage more citizens to purchase hybrid cars so as to improve environmental conditions. The same law established a commission, consisting solely of members of Congress, whose purpose was to obtain information from manufacturers of hybrid automobiles regarding the number, type, and costs to the consumer of hybrid automobiles used in the United States and report its findings on an annual basis to Congress. A manufacturer of hybrid cars objects to having to supply the government with any information about its cars and so resists a subpoena for its chief executive officer to testify before the commission. Insofar as Congress's power to investigate is concerned, the general rule is that:
339	A child lost her lunch on the way to elementary school. She walked to the local grocery store and explained her predicament to the manager. He told her that if she agreed to pay him back the following day, she could have a pre-packaged lunch. The child accepted the manager's offer, picked up her lunch, and promised to pay the manager the following day. If the child refuses to pay and the grocery store sues her for the cost of the lunch and wins, it will be because:
340	Statutes in the jurisdiction define criminal assault as "an attempt to commit a criminal battery" and criminal battery as "causing an offensive touching." As Edward was walking down the street, a gust of wind blew his hat off. Edward reached out, trying to grab his hat, and narrowly missed striking Margaret in the face with his hand. Margaret, fearful of being struck by Edward, pushed Edward away. If charged with criminal battery, Margaret should be found
341	On June 1, Kravat, a manufacturer of men's neckties, received the following order from Clothier: "Ship 500 two-inch ties, assorted stripes, your catalogue No. V34. Delivery by July 1." On June 1, Kravat shipped 500 three-inch ties that arrived at Clothier's place of business on June 3. Clothier immediately telegraphed Kravat: "Reject your shipment. Order was for two-inch ties!" Clothier, however, did not ship the ties back to Kravat. Kravat replied by telegram: "Will deliver proper ties before July 1 Clothier received this telegram on June 4, but did not reply to it. On June 30, Kravat tendered 500 two-inch ties in assorted stripes, designated in his catalogue as item No. V34; but Clothier refused to accept them. Did Clothier properly reject the ties delivered on June 3?
342	A sailor steering his sailboat through a channel was nearly swamped by a large cabin cruiser. The sailor made an obscene gesture and shouted epithets at the captain of the larger boat, who responded by swinging his boat around and heading at high speed directly at the sailboat's bow. The sailor was convinced that the boats would collide, so he steered close to the edge of the channel and abruptly ran aground on a shallow sand bar. The sailor was extremely upset but otherwise uninjured. His boat was not damaged by hitting the sand bar. If the sailor brings an appropriate action against the captain for damages, the probable outcome will be:
343	A landowner conveyed a parcel of land to a buyer by warranty deed. The buyer did not record the deed. One year later, the landowner entered into a written contract with a friend, who had performed many favors for the landowner over the years, to convey the land to the friend for "one dollar." On the closing date provided in the contract, the friend handed the landowner a certified check for one dollar. The landowner handed the friend a quitclaim deed conveying the land to him. The friend promptly recorded the deed. A statute of the state in which the land is located provides: "Any conveyance of an interest in land, other than a lease for less than one year, is not valid against any subsequent purchaser for value without notice thereof whose conveyance is first recorded." In an action to establish ownership of the land, the friend's greatest obstacle to prevailing will be that:
344	A boat owner gave his brother-in-law permission to use his boat for a few hours for fishing. The brother-in-law instead kept the boat overnight, and the next day the boat was struck and seriously damaged by a large tree that fell on it without warning. It was dark when the brotherin-law finally brought the boat home, and the owner immediately went over to the brother-inlaw's house to retrieve it. The owner accidentally ran over a corner of the brother-in-law's garden when he backed his truck up to the boat trailer in the dark. However, when he saw the damage to the boat up close, the owner left the boat there and went home. Assuming that the boat was worth $18,000 before it was damaged and sustained $9,000 worth of damage, what should the owner be entitled to recover in an action against the brother-in-law?
345	Tortfeasor tortiously injured Victim in an auto accident. While Victim was consequently hospitalized in Hospital. Tortfeasor's liability insurer, Insurer, settled with Victim for S5,000. Victim gave Insurer a signed release and received a signed memorandum wherein Insurer promised to pay Victim $5,000 by check within thirty days. When Victim left Hospital two days later, Hospital demanded payment of his $4,00() stated bill. Victim thereupon gave Hospital his own negotiable promissory note for $4,000, payable to Hospital's order in thirty days, and also, as securitv. assigned to Hospital the Insurer settlement memorandum. Hospital promptly assigned for value the settlement memorandum and negotiated the note to Holder, who took the note as a holder in due course. Subsequently Victim misrepresented to Insurer that he had lost the settlement memorandum and needed another. Insurer issued another memorandum identical to the first, and Victim assigned it the ABC Furniture to secure a $5,000 credit sale contract. ABC immediately notified Insurer of this assignment. Later it was discovered that Hospital had mistakenly overbilled Victim by an amount of $1,000 and that Tortfeasor was an irresponsible minor. If Victim starts an action against Insurer forty days after the insurance settlement agreement, can Victim recover?
346	Customer. aged twenty, went into Store at approximately 6:45 p.m. to look at some suits that were on sale. The clerks were busy, and one of them told him that he should wait on himself. Customer selected three suits from a rack and went into the dressing room to try them on. Signs posted on the walls of Store state that closing time is 9:00 p.m.; however, because of a special awards banquet for employees, Store was closed at 7:00 p.m. on this day. The employees, in a hurry to get to the banquet. did not check the dressing rooms or turn off the lights before leaving. When Customer emerged from the dressing room a few minutes after 7:00 p.m., he was alone and locked in. Customer tried the front door, but it was secured on the outside by a bar and padlock, so he went to the rear door. Customer grabbed the door knob and vigorously shook the door. It did not open, but the activity setoff a mechanism that had been installed because of several recent thefts committed by persons who had hidden in the store until after closing time. The mechanism sprayed a chemical mist in Customer's face, causing him to become temporarily blind. The mechanism also activated an alarm carried by Store's employee, Watchman, who was just coming to work. Watchman unlocked the front door, ran into the store. and grabbed Customer. Customer, who was still unable to see, struck out at this person and hit a metal rack, injuring his hand. Watchman then identified himself, and Customer did the same. After assuring himself that Customer was telling the truth, Watchman allowed him to leave. if Customer is to prevail on a claim against Store based on battery from the use of the chemical spray. Customer must establish that
347	By the terms of a written contract signed by both parties on January 15, M.B. Ram, Inc., agreed to sell a specific ICB personal computer to Marilyn Materboard for $3,000, and Materboard agreed to pick up and pay for the computer at Ram's store on February 1. Materboard unjustifiably repudiated on February 1. Without notifying Materboard, Ram subsequently sold at private sale the same specific computer to Byte, who paid the same price ($3,000) in cash. The ICB is a popular product. Ram can buy from the manufacturer more units than it can sell at retail. If Ram sues Materboard for breach of contract, Ram will probably recover
348	An electrician submitted a bid for electrical work in response to a newspaper ad placed by a general contractor, who was bidding on the renovation of an office building. The electrician's bid was the lowest and the general contractor used it to form his bid submitted to the owner of the building. The general contractor was awarded the contract, but later decided to hire another party, who had initially submitted a higher bid, to perform the electrical work. If the electrician sues for damages, will he prevail?
349	After several well-publicized deaths caused by fires in products made from highly flammable fabrics, the state of Orange enacted a statute prohibiting "the manufacture or assembly of any product in this state which contains any fabric that has not been tested and approved for flame retardancy by the Zetest Testing Company." The Zetest Testing Company is a privately owned and operated business located in Orange. For many years, Fabric Mill, located in the state of Orange, has had its fabric tested for flame retardancy by the Alpha Testing Company, located in the state of Green. Alpha Testing Company is a reliable organization that uses a process for testing and approving fabrics for flame retardancy identical in all respects to that used by the Zetest Testing Company. Because Fabric Mill wishes to continue to have its fabric tested solely by Alpha Testing Company, Fabric Mill files an action in Orange state court challenging the constitutionality of the Orange statute as applied to its circumstances. In this suit, the court should hold the statute to be
350	A columnist for a major metropolitan newspaper had a very antagonistic relationship with the city's mayor. When a restaurant owned by the columnist's family was shut down by city health inspectors, the columnist responded with a column publicizing the shutdown and asserting that it was in retaliation for his prior columns in which he had criticized the mayor. In fact, the mayor had nothing to do with the action by the city health inspectors. While the columnist had no evidence of the mayor's involvement, he believed that there was a connection because "that's how the city works." Can the mayor recover against the columnist for defamation?
351	An author who was about to release a book on military censorship in war zones was interviewed by a newspaper reporter. During the interview, the author spoke generally of military censorship in war zones, but would not give the reporter any specific instances of censorship that he intended to include in his book. During the interview, the author received a phone call and excused himself. While the author was out of the room, the reporter found a prepublication copy of the author's book and quickly took photographs of several pages. The reporter later printed the pictures and published an article that included the photographed sections of the book verbatim. The author brought an appropriate action against the reporter for copyright infringement. Assuming that the court properly concludes that any fair use exception in the copyright laws is not applicable, it should:
352	Cycle Company manufactured a bicycle that it sold to Bike Shop, a retail bicycle dealer, which in turn sold it to Roth. Shortly thereafter, while Roth was riding the bicycle along a city street, he saw a traffic light facing him turn from green to amber. He sped up, hoping to cross the intersection before the light turned red. However, Roth quickly realized that he could not do so and applied the brake, which failed. To avoid the traffic that was then crossing in front of him, Roth turned sharply to his right and onto the sidewalk, where he struck P��rez, a pedestrian. Both P��rez and Roth sustained injuries. If P��rez asserts a claim based on negligence against Cycle Company and if it is found that the brake failure resulted from a manufacturing defect in the bicycle, will P��rez prevail?
353	In which of the following situations is Defendant most likely to be guilty of common-law murder?
354	A man owned a parcel of land and gave his friend a typed and signed deed to the property. The man told the friend that he was giving the property to her, but that because he had not had a chance to make copies of the deed, he needed it back until the next day. The friend agreed and gave it back to him. Unfortunately, the man was hit by a bus that evening and died. Assuming that the court finds the description in the deed to be sufficient, which of the following findings is a court likely to make with regard to the friend's interest in the property?
355	During the trial of her personal injury action against a chemical company, the plaintiff testifies in response to a question by her own counsel that, shortly after she and her family were forced to leave their home because of fumes from its plant, the president of the chemical company telephoned her motel room and said, "If you or any member of your family requires medical treatment, our company will pay all medical expenses in full. We will not have it said that our company's negligence resulted in the illness of a local family." The company's counsel makes a motion to strike all of the plaintiff's testimony, and the court does so. Was the court's action correct?
356	An inventor operated a shortwave radio in his home. The inventor maintained a large radio antenna on the rear part of his lot. One day the inventor noticed that the guide wires holding the antenna in place were frayed. He hired a contractor to replace the guide wires with new, stronger wire. The contractor replaced all of the guide wires as per his agreement with the inventor. Four days after the contractor finished his work and the inventor had paid him, the antenna fell over onto the inventor's neighbor's house, causing severe damage. If the neighbor brings suit against the inventor for damages to his home, the neighbor is most likely to prevail against the inventor because:
357	A developer purchased a 25-acre tract of land abutting an industrial park. The property was rezoned for mixed residential and commercial use and subdivided into 50 half-acre lots. The developer sold the 30 lots furthest from the industrial park to buyers using deeds that restricted the lots to residential use. Only 15 of those lots were improved with single-family homes. Over the next 10 years, the owners of the other 15 lots constructed commercial buildings on their land. Five years later, the developer sold the remaining 20 lots to an investor who planned to erect a shopping mall on the land. An original owner of one of the lots with a single-family home objects to the investor's proposed use. If the investor is permitted to build the shopping mall, it will be because:
358	State Y has a state employee grievance system that requires any state employee who wishes to file a grievance against the state to submit that grievance for final resolution to a panel of three arbitrators chosen by the parties from a statewide board of 13 arbitrators. In any given case, the grievant and the state alternate in exercising the right of each party to eliminate five members of the board, leaving a panel of three members to decide their case. At the present time, the full board is composed of seven male arbitrators and six female arbitrators. Ellen, a female state employee, filed a sexual harassment grievance against her male supervisor and the state. Anne, the state's attorney, exercised all of her five strikes to eliminate five of the female arbitrators. At the time she did so, Anne stated that she struck the five female arbitrators solely because she believed women, as a group, would necessarily be biased in favor of another woman who was claiming sexual harassment. Counsel for Ellen eliminated four males and one female arbitrator, all solely on grounds of specific bias or conflicts of interest. As a result, the panel was all male. When the panel ruled against Ellen on the merits of her case, she filed an action in an appropriate state court, challenging the panel selection process as a gender-based denial of equal protection of the laws. In this case, the court should hold that the panel selection process is
359	An insurer offered a plan to cover an insured's catastrophic illnesses for the remainder of the insured's life in exchange for a large one-time payment at the inception of coverage. Because the program was experimental, the insurer would accept only a fixed number of applications during the enrollment period. A recent retiree in good health was one of the applicants accepted, and he enrolled in the program. He paid the one-time premium of $30,000 a few days before coverage began. The day after his coverage started, he was struck by a bus and killed. The executor of the retiree's estate reviewed the policy and immediately notified the bank to stop payment on it. The insurer then filed suit against the retiree's estate. Will the court compel the estate to pay the premium to the insurer?
360	For ten years, Vacationer and Neighbor have owned summer vacation homes on adjoining lots. A stream flows through both lots. As a result of a childhood swimming accident, Vacationer is afraid of water and has never gone close to the stream. Neighbor built a dam on her property that has completely stopped the flow of the stream to Vacationer's property. In a suit by Vacationer against Neighbor, will Vacationer prevail?
361	An ordinance of City makes it unlawful to park a motor vehicle on a City street within ten feet ofa fire hydrant. At 1:55 p.m. Parker, realizing he must be in Bank before it closed at 2:00 p.m., and finding no other space available, parked his automobile in front of a fire hydrant on a City street. Parker then hurried into the bank, leaving his aged neighbor, Ned, as a passenger in the rear seat of the car. About 5 minutes later, and while Parker was still in Bank, Driver was driving down the street. Driver swerved to avoid what he mistakenly thought was a hole in the street and sideswiped Parker's car. Parker's car was turned over on top of the hydrant, breaking the hydrant and causing a small flood of water. Parker's car was severely damaged and Ned was badly injured. There is no applicable guest statute. If City asserts a claim against Driver for the damage to the fire hydrant and Driver was negligent in swerving his car, his negligence is
362	A 54-year-old employee filed an employment age discrimination suit against a corporation, alleging that its personnel director had improperly terminated his employment. In defense, the corporation presents a written report summarizing a meeting between the personnel director and the employee that was prepared directly after the meeting and placed in the employee's personnel file, and that contains several damaging admissions by the employee. Which of the following is not among the foundational facts the corporation will have to establish if it wants to have the report admitted under the past recollection recorded exception to the hearsay rule?
363	A state statute provided for the suspension or revocation of a retail business license where there have been "repeated violations" of specified regulatory statutes by any one individual or business. A store owner had already been fined three times under the statute. Several days later, the store owner received a notice from the regulatory agency that was created by the statute stating that his business license will be suspended for 21 days for violation of the statute. If the store owner files suit to set aside the suspension, the owner will most likely:
364	Johnson took a diamond ring to a pawnshop and borrowed $20 on it. It was agreed that the loan was to be repaid within 60 days and if it was not, the pawnshop owner. Defendant, could sell the ring A week before expiration of the 60 days. Defendant had an opportunity to sell the ring to a customer for S125. He did so, thinking it unlikely that Johnson would repay the loan and if he did, Defendant would be able to handle him somehow, even by paying him for the ring if necessary. Two days later. Johnson came in with the money to reclaim his ring. Defendant told him that it had been stolen when his shop was burglarized one night and that therefore he was not responsible for its loss. Larceny, embezzlement, and false pretenses are separate crimes in the jurisdiction. Suppose in the case above. instead of denying liability, Defendant told Johnson the truththat he sold the ring because he thought Johnson would not reclaim it-and offered to give Johnson $125. Johnson demanded his ring. Defendant said, 'Look buddy, that's what I got for it and it's more than it's worth," John reluctantly took the money. Defendant could most appropriately be found guilty of
365	Lee contracted with Mover, an interstate carrier, to ship household goods from the state of Green to his new home in the state of Pink. A federal statute provides that all liability of an interstate mover to a shipper for loss of or damage to the shipper's goods in transit is governed exclusively by the contract between them. The statute also requires the mover to offer a shipper at least two contracts with different levels of liability. In full compliance with that federal statute, Mover offered Lee a choice between two shipping agreements that provided different levels of liability on the part of Mover. The more expensive contract provided that Mover was fully liable in case of loss or damage. The less expensive contract limited Mover's liability in case of loss or damage to less than full value. Lee voluntarily signed the less expensive contract with Mover, fixing Mover's liability at less than the full value of the shipment. Mover's truck was involved in an accident in the state of Pink. The accident was entirely a product of the negligence of Mover's driver. Lee's household goods were totally destroyed. In accordance with the contract, Mover reimbursed Lee for less than the full value of the goods. Lee then brought suit against Mover under the tort law of the state of Pink claiming that he was entitled to be reimbursed for the full value of the goods. Mover filed a motion to dismiss. In this suit, the court should
366	Betty Bower, an adult, asked Jeff Geetus to lend her $1,000. Geetus replied that he would do so only if Bower's father, Cash, would guarantee the loan. At Bower's request, Cash mailed a signed letter to Geetus: "If you lend $1,000 to my daughter, I will repay it if she doesn't." On September 15, Geetus, having read Cash's letter, lent $1,000 to Bower, which Bower agreed to repay in installments of $100 plus accrued interest on the last day of each month beginning October 31. Cash died on September 16. Later that same day, unaware of Cash's death, Geetus mailed a letter to Cash advising that he had made the $1,000 loan to Bower on September 15. Bower did not pay the installments due on October 31, November 30, or December 31, and has informed Geetus that she will be unable to make repayments in the foreseeable future. On January 15, Geetus is entitled to a judgment against Bower for which of the following amounts?
367	Taylor and Scott, an unmarried couple, purchased a condominium as tenants in common and lived in the condominium for three years. Subsequently, they made a verbal agreement that, on the death of either of them, the survivor would own the entire condominium, and, as a result, they decided they did not need wills. Two years later, Taylor and Scott were involved in the same automobile accident. Taylor was killed immediately. Scott died one week later. Both died intestate. Taylor's sole heir is his brother, Mark. Scott's sole heir is her mother, Martha. Mark claimed one-half of the condominium, and Martha claimed all of it. The jurisdiction has no applicable statute except for the Statute of Frauds; nor does it recognize common-law marriages. In an appropriate action by Martha claiming the entire ownership of the condominium, the court will find that
368	Walker, a pedestrian, started north across the street in a clearly marked north-south crosswalk with the green traffic light in her favor. Walker was in a hurry, and so before reaching the north curb of the street, she cut to her left diagonally across the street to the east-west crosswalk and started across it. Just after reaching the east-west crosswalk, the traffic light turned green in her favor. She proceeded about five steps farther across the street to the west in the crosswalk when she was struck by a car approaching from her right that she thought would stop, but did not. The car driven by Driver, 81 years of age, who failed to stop his car after seeing that the traffic light was red against him. Walker had a bone disease, resulting in very brittle bones, that is prevalent in only 0.02 percent of the population. As a result of the impact Walker suffered a broken leg and the destruction of her family heirloom, a Picasso original painting that she was taking to her bank for safe-keeping. The painting had been purchased by Walker's grandmother for $750 but was valued at $500,000 at the time of the accident. Walker has filed suit against Driver. Driver's attorney has alleged that Walker violated a state statute requiring that pedestrians stay in the crosswalks, and that if Walker had not violated the statute she would have had to walk 25 feet more to reach the impact point and therefore would not have been at a place where she could have been hit by Driver. Walker's attorney ascertains that there is a statute as alleged by Driver, that his measurements are correct, that there is a state statute requiring observance of traffic lights, and that Driver's license expired two years prior to the collision. Walker's violation of the crosswalk statute should not be considered by the jury because
369	A cyclist was injured when a driver ran a red light. The cyclist subsequently sued the driver to recover for her injuries, and obtained a money judgment of $50,000. The state where the cyclist and the driver reside has the following statute: "Any judgment properly filed shall, for 10 years from filing, be a lien on the real property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person against whom the judgment is rendered." The cyclist filed the judgment in the county where the driver owned a valuable ranch. Sometime later, the driver, who was also injured in the accident, undertook to remodel all the buildings on the ranch to make them wheelchairaccessible. The driver borrowed $30,000 from a bank for the improvements, securing the loan with a mortgage on the ranch. The bank properly recorded its mortgage. Before he paid any principal on the bank's loan, the driver decided to build a new barn. He borrowed $20,000 from a financing company for this purpose, also secured by a mortgage on the ranch. The financing company properly recorded its mortgage. The driver subsequently defaulted on the bank's mortgage, and the bank brought a foreclosure action, joining the financing company in the proceeding. The foreclosure sale resulted in $90,000 in proceeds after all expenses and fees were paid. The driver still owes the cyclist $50,000, the bank $30,000, and the financing company $20,000. How should the foreclosure proceeds be distributed?
370	The mayor of a small city decided that he would like to start each city council meeting with a nonsectarian prayer. Several city council members and citizens objected to the proposal, claiming that it would violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The mayor argued that it would not constitute the establishment of a religion because he would invite clerics from all of the different religious sects to take turns giving the prayer at the meetings. When the council members still objected, the mayor asked the city attorney to research the constitutionality of his proposal. How should the attorney advise the mayor?
371	Martha's high school teacher told her that she was going to receive a failing grade in history, which would prevent her from graduating. Furious, she reported to the principal that the teacher had fondled her, and the teacher was fired. A year later, still unable to get work because of the scandal, the teacher committed suicide. Martha, remorseful, confessed that her accusation had been false. If Martha is charged with manslaughter, her best defense would be that she
372	Oliver, owner of Blackacre, needed money. Blackacre was fairly worth $100,000, so Oliver tried to borrow $60,000 from Len on the security of Blackacre. Len agreed, but only if Oliver would convey Blackacre to Len outright by warranty deed, with Len agreeing orally to reconvey to Oliver once the loan was paid according to its terms. Oliver agreed, conveyed Blackacre to Len by warranty deed, and Len paid Oliver $60,000 cash. Len promptly and properly recorded Oliver's deed. Now, Oliver has defaulted on repayment with $55,000 still due on the loan. Oliver is still in possession. Which of the following best states the parties' rights in Blackacre?
373	The United States Surgeon General was cited for contempt for refusing to answer questions as part of a Senate investigation regarding an issue in the Food and Drug Administration. His contempt citation will be dismissed if he can show that:
374	The owner of a personal watercraft put an ad for its sale in the paper. Her neighbor saw the ad and told her that he wanted to buy the watercraft but had to arrange for financing. The owner suggested that they write a contract for sale then and there so that they would not have to waste any time while he got his financing. They orally agreed that the contract would not become binding unless the neighbor obtained financing, but the written contract did not mention this and appeared to be a fully integrated document. The neighbor could not obtain financing and the owner brings suit to enforce the written contract. Who will prevail?
375	Hammond decided to kill his wife by poisoning her. He asked his friend, Jordan, a pharmacist, to obtain some curare, a deadly poison, and to give it to him without recording the transaction. Because Jordan suspected Hammond's motive, she supplied Hammond with a small quantity of Marvane, an antibiotic, instead of curare. Marvane is harmless if administered in small quantities, except for the less than 1 percent of the population who are allergic to the drug. Hammond injected his wife with the Marvane while she slept. She was allergic to the drug and died from the injection. Jordan was distraught and confessed the entire affair to the police, explaining that she had failed to report Hammond's conduct to the authorities because she feared that it would end their friendship if she did. Jordan is an accomplice to
376	An amateur inventor purchased a laser made for home hobbyist use and set it up on his roof to try to bounce a signal off of a satellite. He attempted to boost its power output with an overthe-counter voltage booster. However, because of a defective voltage regulation device in the laser that was present when it left the factory, the voltage booster caused the laser to overheat and explode. A fragment of molten quartz struck a neighbor, injuring him. The neighbor brought an action against the laser manufacturer for the physical injuries he suffered as a result of the explosion. At trial, the neighbor presents evidence of the above facts. The manufacturer establishes that its laser was never intended to be used at the power levels necessary to reach a satellite, and that it exercised due care in the manufacture of the laser. The manufacturer moves for a directed verdict after the close of evidence. The court should:
377	A doctor in one state wanted to obtain malpractice insurance from a reputable company located in another state. However, the laws of the state in which the doctor works require physicians to obtain malpractice insurance only from carriers located within that state. The doctor challenges this requirement in state court, alleging that the requirement violates the United States Constitution. His challenge will most likely:

379	An employee laced a co-worker's drink with a small quantity of a mild hallucinogen as a prank, expecting that her co-worker would have a minor vision or two and act in a comical manner. However, he had a severe reaction to the drug and experienced extreme hallucinations. The employee promptly brought her co-worker to the emergency room of a nearby hospital. The co-worker was put under observation for a couple of hours, but then was negligently released prematurely by the emergency room physician on duty. The next day, while driving, the co-worker had another powerful hallucination and drove his car into a bridge abutment. The co-worker sued the employee for his injuries. If the jury determines that the automobile accident was not reasonably foreseeable, the co-worker's suit against the employee will:
380	Devlin was the owner of a large subdivision. Parnell became interested in purchasing a Lot but could not decide between Lot 40 and Lot 41. The price and fair market value of each of those two lots was $5,000. Parnell paid Devlin $5,000, which Devlin accepted, and Devlin delivered to Parnell a deed which was properly executed, complete, and ready for recording in every detail except that the space in the deed for the lot number was left blank. Devlin told Parnell to fill in either Lot 40 or Lot 41 according to his decision and then to record the deed. Parnell visited the development the next day and completely changed his mind, selecting Lot 25. He filled in Lot 25 and duly recorded the deed. The price of Lot 25 and its fair market value was $7,500. Assume the following facts for this question only. Before Devlin had time to Learn of Parnell's actions, Parnell sold Lot 25 to Caruso for $6,000 by a duly and properly executed, delivered, and recorded warranty deed. Caruso knew that Devlin had put a price of $7,500 on Lot 25, but he knew no other facts regarding the Devlin-Parnell transaction. Caruso's attorney accurately reported Parnell's record title to be good, marketable, and free of encumbrances. Neither Caruso nor his attorney made any further investigation outside the record. Devlin brought an appropriate action against Caruso to recover title to Lot 25. If Devlin loses, the most likely basis for the judgment is that
381	Passer was driving his pickup truck along a lonely road on a very cold night. Passer saw Tom, who was a stranger, lying in a field by the side of the road and apparently injured. Passer stopped his truck, alighted, and, upon examining Tom, discovered that Tom was intoxicated and in danger of suffering from exposure to the cold. However, Passer returned to his truck and drove away without making any effort to help Tom. Tom remained lying at the same place and was later injured when struck by a car driven by Traveler. Traveler, who was drowsy and inattentive, had veered off the road into the field and hit Tom. Traveler did not see Tom prior to hitting him. If Tom asserts a claim against Traveler, will Tom prevail?
382	Owner held 500 acres in fee simple absolute. In 1960 Owner platted and obtained all required governmental approvals of two subdivisions of 200 acres each. In 1960 and 1961 commercial buildings and parking facilities were constructed on one,RoyalCenter, in accordance with the plans disclosed by the plat for each subdivision. Royal Center continues to be used for commercial purposes. The plat of the other, Royal Oaks, showed 250 lots, streets, and utility and drainage easements. All of the lots in Royal Oaks were conveyed during 1960 and 1961. The deeds contained provisions, expressly stated to be binding upon the grantee, his heirs and assigns, requiring the lots to be used only for single-family, residential purposes until 1985. The deeds expressly stated that these provisions were enforceable by the owner of any lot in the Royal Oaks subdivision. At all times since 1959, the 200 acres in Royal Center have been zoned for shopping center use, and the 200 acres in Royal Oaks have been zoned for residential use in a classification which permits both single-family and multiplefamily use. For this question only, assume that Owner now desires to open his remaining 100 acres as a residential subdivision of 125 lots (with appropriate streets, etc.). He has, as an essential element of his scheme, the feature that the restrictions should be identical with those he planned for the original Royal Oaks residential subdivision and, further, that lot owners in Royal Oaks should be able to enforce (by lawsuits) restrictions on the lots in the 100 acres. The zoning for the 100 acres is identical with that for the 200 acres of Royal Oaks residential subdivision. Which of the following best states the chance of success for his scheme?
383	A buyer is interested in buying the northern half of a large tract of land from its current owner. The land has a stream running across it that eventually flows into a river on the northern half of the land. The buyer and seller eventually agree on the price, and the seller conveys by deed to the buyer according to the following description: "The upper portion of my land, from the northern boundary to the stream." In determining the exact boundaries of the portion of the land purchased by the buyer, which of the following would be the most accurate?
384	In 1970, Oscar, owner of a 100-acre tract, prepared and duly recorded a subdivision plan called Happy Acres. The plan showed 90 one-acre lots and a ten-acre tract in the center that was designated "Future Public School." Oscar published and distributed a brochure promoting Happy Acres which emphasized the proximity of the lots to the school property and indicated potential tax savings "because the school district will not have to expend tax money to-acquire this property." There is no specific statute concerning the dedication of school sites. Oscar sold 50 of the lots to individual purchasers. Each deed referred to the recorded plan and also contained the following clause: "No mobile home shall be erected on any lot within Happy Acres." Sarah was one of the original purchasers from Oscar. In 1976, Oscar sold the remaining 40 lots and the ten-acre tract to Max by a deed which referred to the plan and contained the restriction relating to mobile homes. Max sold the 40 lots to individual purchasers and the ten-acre tract to Pete. None of the deeds from Max referred to the plan or contained any reference to mobile homes. Assume for this question only that Pete has announced his intention of erecting a fast food restaurant on the ten-acre tract and that Sarah has filed an action to enjoin Pete. If Sarah wins, it will be because
385	In Peck's antitrust suit against manufacturers of insulation, Peck's interrogatories asked for information concerning total sales of insulation by each of the defendant manufacturers in a particular year. The defendants replied to the interrogatories by referring Peck to the Insulation Manufacturer's Annual Journal for the information. If, at trial, Peck offers the annual as evidence of the sales volume, this evidence is
386	West, a witness in a contract case, testified on direct examination that four people attended a meeting. When asked to identify them, she gave the names of three but despite trying was unable to remember the name of the fourth person. The attorney who called her as a witness seeks to show her his handwritten notes of the part of his pretrial interview with her in which she provided all four names. The trial court is likely to consider the showing of the notes taken as
387	On May I Ohner telegraphed Byer, "Will sell you any or all of the lots in Grove subdivision at $5,000 each. Details follow in letter." The letter contained all the necessary details concerning terms of payment, insurance, mortgages, etc., and provided, "This offer remains open until June I." On May 2, after he had received the telegram but before he had received the letter, Byer telegraphed Ohner, " Accept your offer with respect to lot 101." Both parties knew that there were fifty lots in the Grove subdivision and that they were numbered 101 through 150. For this question only, assume that on May 6 Byer telegraphed Ohner. "Will take the rest of the lots' dand that on May 8 Ohner discovered that he did not have good title to the remaining lots. Which of the following would provide the best legal support to Ohner's contention that he was not liable for breach of contract as to the remaining forty-nine lots?
388	A statute of the state of East Dakota requires each insurance company that offers burglary insurance policies in the state to charge a uniform rate for such insurance to all of its customers residing within the same county in that state. So long as it complies with this requirement, a company is free to charge whatever rate the market will bear for its burglary insurance policies. An insurance company located in the state of East Dakota files suit in federal district court against appropriate East Dakota state officials to challenge this statute on constitutional grounds. The insurance company wishes to charge customers residing within the same county in East Dakota rates for burglary insurance policies that will vary because they would be based on the specific nature of the customer's business, on its precise location, and on its past claims record. In this suit, the court should
389	A woman was driving carefully but with an expired driver's license, in violation of a statute requiring license renewal. When she stopped at a stop sign, another driver, who was speeding, crashed into her car. The woman suffered injuries and sued the other driver. The fact that the woman had an expired driver's license would not affect her claim against the other driver because:
390	A police officer saw an unarmed thief grab a coat off the rack of a store and run. As the police officer gave chase, the thief ducked into an alley. When the police officer came to the alley, she saw movement behind some boxes. She yelled for the thief to come out or she would shoot. When the thief did not, the police officer shot at the boxes. A bag lady had been asleep behind them, and she was killed. The police officer is charged with homicide. A jury should find the police officer:
391	A driver was driving his car negligently along a mountain road. He lost control of his car and careened over the side of a cliff. A jogger saw the driver's car go off the cliff and stopped to see if he could help. The jogger started to climb down the cliff to render aid to the driver. In doing so, the jogger slipped and broke his leg. The jogger sued the driver to recover damages for his broken leg. Rgarding any defenses the driver might raise, which of the following statements is correct?
392	In a written contract Singer agreed to deliver to Byer 500 described chairs at $20 each F.O.B. Singer's place of business. The contract provided that "neither party will assign this contract without the written consent of the other." Singer placed the chairs on board a carrier on January 30. On February 1 Singer said in a signed writing, "I hereby assign to Wheeler all my rights under the Singer-Byer contract." Singer did not request and did not get Byer's consent to this transaction. On February 2 the chairs while in transit were destroyed in a derailment of the carrier's railroad car. In an action by Byer against Singer for breach of contract, Byer probably will
393	The defendant is on trial for murder. During the trial, the prosecution offers into evidence a properly authenticated affidavit summarizing the results of the defendant's fingerprint test, as proof that the fingerprints on the murder weapon are those of the defendant. The affidavit was prepared pursuant to statute by the lab technician that conducted the test. The defendant objects to the evidence. How should the court rule?
394	Homeowner hired Arsonist to set fire to Homeowner's house so that Homeowner could collect the insurance proceeds from the fire. After pouring gasoline around the house, Arsonist lit the fire with his cigarette lighter and then put the lighter in his pocket. As Arsonist was standing back admiring his work, the lighter exploded in his pocket. Arsonist suffered severe burns to his leg. Arsonist brought an action against the manufacturer of the lighter based on strict product liability. Under applicable law, the rules of pure comparative fault apply in such actions. Will Arsonist prevail?
395	Susie Blake, a working woman, always brought her lunch to eat in the office. One Saturday afternoon she went to Roger's Market, a local self-service grocery, and bought a can of corned beef. The can had printed on its label "A Product of West Beef Company." The company was a reputable supplier of beef products. On Sunday evening, Susie prepared a sandwich for lunch for the next day, using the can of corned beef she had bought on Saturday. When Susie bit into her sandwich at lunch time the next day, a large sliver of bone concealed in the corned beef slice pierced between her teeth, broke one off, and came to rest deep in the roof of her mouth. This accident caused her to suffer severe pain and to incur medical expenses of $700. Susie brought two claims for damages: one against Roger's Market and the other against West Beef Company. The claims were tried together. At the trial, Susie proved all of the above facts leading up to her injury as well as the elements of her damage. West Beef Company, one of the defendants, proved that it had not processed and packed the corned beef, but that such had been done by its regular and independent supplier, Meat Packers, Inc. West Beef Company further proved that it had never obtained from Meat Packers, Inc. defective meat products, and that it had no way of knowing that the can contained any dangerous material. Roger's Market, the other defendant, proved that it had no way of knowing the content of the can was likely to cause harm, and that it had sold the products of West Beef Company for a number of yearshwithout ever having been told by a customer that the products were defective. Both defendants agreed by stipulation in open court that Meat Packers, Inc. had been guilty of negligence in packing the corned beef containing the sliver of bone. If Susie's claim against West Beef Company is based on the theory of strict liability in tort, Susie will
396	While practicing their target shooting at the firing range, a man and woman got into an argument that almost erupted into physical combat, except that they were restrained and separated by bystanders. Later, in the parking lot of the range, the man shot the woman in the shoulder. Bystanders who rushed to the scene immediately after hearing the man's shot found the woman on the pavement with a black metal flashlight in her hand. The woman's pistol was in her locker at the firing range. At the trial of the woman's civil action for battery against the man, the woman established that the man intentionally shot her. In defense, the man testified that the woman approached him, saying, "We'll settle this once and for all, right now," and raised an object toward the man. He testified that he feared that the woman was about to shoot him with a pistol, so he fired in self-defense. Assuming that the jury decides that the man is telling the truth, to find in his favor the jury also will need to find:

On cross-examination the prosecutor intends to ask Darden whether he had been convicted of burglary six years earlier. The question concerning the burglary conviction is
398	A bank robber held up the local bank at gunpoint wearing a nylon stocking over his head to conceal his identity. He ran out of the bank with the money, intending to get to the nearby train station and catch a train out of town. A customer of the bank had left her car running in the parking lot while she had dashed into the bank to make a quick deposit. The robber jumped into the customer's car and sped off to the train station. He left the car in the parking lot and boarded the train, but he was eventually apprehended and charged with bank robbery. If the robber is also charged with larceny of the customer's car, he should be found:

400	The owner of a ranch in fee simple died and left the property to his daughter, "my daughter, her heirs and assigns; but if my son is living 25 years from the date of my death, then to my son, his heirs and assigns." At the time of the owner's death, his son was one year old. The common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in the jurisdiction. The grant in the will to the owner's son is:
401	in 1930, Owens, the owner in fee simple of Barrenacres, a large, undeveloped tract of land, granted an easement to the Water District "to install, inspect, repair, maintain, and replace pipes" within a properly delineated strip of land twenty feet wide across Barrenacres. The easement permitted the Water District to enter Barrenacres for only the stated purposes. The Water District promptly and properly recorded the deed. In 1931, the Water District installed a water main which crossed Barrenacres within the described strip: the Water District has not since entered Barrenacres. In 1935, Owens sold Barrenacres to Peterson, but the deed, which was promptly and properly recorded, failed to refer to the Water District easement. Peterson built his home on Barrenacres in 1935, and since that time he has planted and maintained, at great expense in money, time, and effort, a formal garden area which covers, among other areas, the surfac- of the twenty-foot easement strip. In 1976, the Water District proposed to excavate the entire length of its main in order to inspect, repair, and replace the main, to the extent necessary. At a public meeting, at which Peterson was present, the Water District announced its plans and declared its intent to do as little damage as possible to any property involved. Peterson objected to the Water District plans. Assume that Peterson reserved his rights and after the Water District completed its work sued for the $5,000 in damages he suffered by reason of the Water District entry. Peterson's attempt to secure damages probably will
402	The state of Green imposes a tax on the "income" of each of its residents. As defined in the taxing statute, "income" includes the fair rental value of the use of any automobile provided by the taxpayer's employer for the taxpayer's personal use. The federal government supplies automobiles to some of its employees who are resident in Green so that they may perform their jobs properly. A federal government employee supplied with an automobile for this purpose may also use it for the employee's own personal business. Assume there is no federal legislation on this subject. May the state of Green collect this tax on the fair rental value of the personal use of the automobiles furnished by the federal government to these employees?
403	A federal statute was enacted that provided federal funds to open child health care centers in inner-city areas. The strongest constitutional basis for this enactment is the:
404	A city's airport board that oversees a large international airport in the United States has adopted a policy of reviewing current vendor licensees every three years. During the process, the board reviews customer comments, assesses the utility of the vendor's services, and reviews the profitability of the vendor (licensees pay rent based on a percentage of their gross profit). The licensee is entitled to present evidence on all of the issues reviewed. The owner of a franchised currency exchange on wheels had a license to operate the cart within the airport until last week, when his license came up for review. After an appropriate hearing, the board refused to renew the owner's license mainly because of an excessive number of customer complaints. Nevertheless, the owner continued operating his cart pursuant to a license granted to him under the Federal Borders Act that allowed him to operate his cart at all borders or their functional equivalent. A city police officer patrolling the airport asked to see the owner's license. The owner showed his federal license, but the officer issued the owner a citation because he did not have a city license. Which of the following is the owner's best constitutional defense?
405	Neff and Owens owned adjoining residences in Smithville. In 1971, they hired a contractor to lay sidewalks in front of both of their homes. Each man was to pay the contractor for that part of the work attributable to his property. After he had paid the bill which the contractor had submitted to him, Neff became convinced that the contractor had erred and had charged him for labor and materials which were used for part of the sidewalk in front of Owens' property. Neff thereupon asked Owens to reimburse him for the amount which he assumed he had erroneously paid the contractor. After a lengthy discussion, and although he was still convinced that he owed Neff nothing, Owens finally said: "I want to avoid trouble, and so if you agree not to sue for reimbursement, I'll employ a caretaker for a three-year term to keep our sidewalks free of ice and snow." Neff orally assented. Although he could have hired the man for three years, Owens hired Parsons in October, 1971, to keep the snow and ice off the sidewalks for the winter, November 1971-March 1972. During the early fall of 1972, Owens decided to go to Florida for the winter. He told his nephew, Morse, that he could live in Owens' house for the winter provided Morse would hire someone to keep the snow and ice off the walks in front of both Neff's and Owens' properties, and suggested that Morse could hire Parsons for that task at relatively little cost. Morse moved into Owens' home in October, 1972, but moved out November, 1972, prior to any icing or snowfall. He did not employ anyone to remove snow and ice in front of either property. Owens did not know that Morse had moved out of his home until he returned to Smithville in the spring. During the winter Neff had kept his own walks clean. No one cleaned the snow and ice from the walks in front of Owens' property. Assume that the contractor had made no error and that Neff had paid only for labor and materials for the walk in front of his own property. Was Owens' promise to hire a caretaker supported by consideration?
406	An investor owned a 100-acre parcel that contained several natural asphalt lakes. A construction company was erecting highways for the state in the vicinity of the investor's land and needed a supply of asphalt. The investor executed a document that, in return for a payment of $1 per barrel, gave the company the right to enter on the land and take asphalt in whatever quantities the company desired. The investor reserved the right to remove asphalt herself and to grant this right to others. Last year, the state commenced an action in eminent domain to take the investor's land for a public park. Is the construction company entitled to compensation?
407	On November 1 the following notice was posted in a privately operated law school The faculty, seeking to encourage legal xesearch, offers to any student at this school who wins the current National Obscenity Law Competition the additional prize of $500. All competing papers must be submitted to the Dean's office before next May 1. (The National Competition is conducted by an outside agency, unconnected with any law school.) Student read this notice on November 2, and thereupon intensified his effort to make his paper on obscenity law, which he started in October, a winner. Student also left on a counter in the Dean's office a signed note saying, "I accept the faculty's $500 Obscenity Competition offer." This note was madvertently placed in Student's file and never reached the Dean or any faculty member personally. On the following April 1, the above notice was removed and the following substituted therefor: The faculty regrets that our offer regarding the National Obscenity Law Competition must be withdrawn. Student's paper was submitted through the Dean's office on April 15. On May 1, it was announced that Student had won the National Obscenity Law Competition and the prize of $1,000. The law faculty refused to pay anything. The promise of the faculty on November 1 was
408	An appropriations act passed by Congress over the President's veto directs that one billion dollars ''shall be spent by the federal government for the development of a new military weapons system, which is available only from the Arms Corporation. On the order of the President. the Secretary of Defense refuses to authorize a contract for purchase of the weapons system. The Arms Corporation sues the Secretary of Defense alleging an unlawful withholding of these federal funds. The strongest constitutional argument for the Arms Corporation is that
409	Dower, an inexperienced driver, borrowed a car from Puder, a casual acquaintance, for the express purpose of driving it several blocks to the local drug store. Instead, Dower drove the car, which then was worth $12,000, 100 miles to Other City. While Dower was driving in Other City the next day, the car was hit by a negligently driven truck and sustained damage that will cost $3,000 to repair. If repaired, the car will be fully restored to its former condition. If Puder asserts a claim against Dower based on conversion, Puder should recover a judgment for
410	On September 14, a farmer sent a signed communication to a commercial bakery, offering to sell to the bakery 100 bushels of wheat at $30 each. This offer was received by the bakery on September 17. On September 18, the bakery e-mailed the farmer to order 50 bushels of wheat, with half to be delivered on October 1 and the other half on November 1. The farmer refuses to deliver the wheat as ordered and defends on the ground that his offer was for the sale of 100 bushels of wheat in one lot only. The court should hold that:
411	A law enforcement officer was transporting a prisoner on a plane to testify in a criminal case. Unknown to those on the plane, an assassin hired to kill the prisoner had bribed an airport baggage handler to sneak a timed-release crate of poisonous snakes into the cargo hold of the plane. Once the crate was triggered to open, the snakes were able to slither into the passenger compartment through gaps in the conduits between the cargo hold and the passenger compartment. In the ensuing panic caused by the snakes, the officer was struck in the head by a fire extinguisher that another passenger threw at a snake, and suffered a severe concussion. The officer filed suit against numerous parties, including the person who designed the conduit system on that type of plane. At trial, evidence established that the design for the conduit system that he used had been rejected in the industry because of the danger of pressure loss between the cargo hold and the passenger compartment. An industry-approved design that the designer could have used would have kept the snakes from getting into the passenger compartment of the plane. As between the officer and the designer, which party is likely to prevail?
412	After several days of negotiations, Ohner wrote to Plummer: "Will pay you $3,000 if you will install new plumbing in my office building according to the specifications I have sent you. I must have your reply by March 30." Plummer replied by a letter that Ohner received on March 15: "Will not do it for less than $3,500." On March 20, Plummer wrote to Ohner: "Have changed my mind. I will do the work for $3,000. Unless I hear from you to the contrary, I will begin work on April 5." Ohner received this letter on March 22 but did not reply to it. Plummer, without Ohner's knowledge, began the work on April 5. Which of the following best characterizes the legal relationship between Ohner and Plummer as of April 5?
413	A car driven by Dan entered land owned by and in the possession of Peter, without Peter's permission. Which, if any, of the following allegations, without additional facts, would provide a sufficient basis for a claim by Peter against Dan? I. Dan intentionally drove his car onto Peter's land. II. Dan negligently drove his car onto Peter's land. III. Dan's car damaged Peter's land.
414	Defendant was charged with murder. His principal defense was that he had killed in hot blood and should be guilty only of manslaughter. The judge instructed the jury that the state must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, that the killing was presumed to be murder, and that the charge could bereduced to manslaughter, and Defendant accordingly found guilty of this lesser offense, if Defendant showed by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the killing was committed in the heat of passion on sudden provocation. Defendant was convicted of murder. On appeal, he seeks a new trial and claims error in the judge's instructions to the jury. Defendant's conviction will most probably be
415	The plaintiff was injured when she slipped at the defendant restaurant. The defense attorney asked the manager on duty at the time of the incident to prepare a report of the accident. This report was given to the defense attorney prior to trial. During discovery, the plaintiff demands that a copy of the report be produced. Will the court order the defendant to produce the report?
416	Oren owned Purpleacre, a tract of land, in fee simple. By will duly admitted to probate after his death, Oren devised Purpleacre to "any wife who survives me with remainder to such of my children as are living at her death." Oren was survived by Wen, his wife, and by three children, Cynthia, Cam, and Camelia. Thereafter, Cam died and by will duly admitted to probate devised his entire estate to David. Cynthia and Camelia were Cam's heirs at law. Later Wen died. In appropriate lawsuit to which Cynthia, Camelia, and David are parties, title to Purpleacre is at issue. In such lawsuit, judgment should be that title to Purpleacre is in
417	A woman's car was stolen while parked. The car was never recovered. Following all required procedures, she filed a claim with her insurer. The insurer refused to pay, claiming that the loss was not covered because the woman had not locked her car as required by her policy. In a declaratory judgment action, the woman seeks to testify that she always locks her car when she gets out of it. The judge should find the woman's offer to testify:
418	A man defeated a woman in a close election to determine the president of the State Carpenters' Union. Shortly after the election, the woman discovered that the man had been a member of the Communist Party 15 years ago. The United States has a statute that prohibits a member of the Communist Party from serving as an officer of a labor union. The woman revealed this information to the executive board of the Carpenters' Union, which declared the man's election as president invalid. The man brings suit in federal court, challenging the constitutionality of the United States statute. The court will most likely hold the statute to be:
419	A bill collector for a store came to a consumer's house at 7 p.m. on a summer evening while many of the consumer's neighbors were seated on their porches. When the consumer opened the door, the bill collector, who was standing just outside the door, raised an electrically amplified bullhorn to his mouth. In a voice that could be heard a block away, the bill collector called the consumer a "deadbeat" and asked him when he intended to pay his bill to the store. In fact, the consumer did not owe any money to the store. If the consumer asserts a claim based on defamation against the bill collector and prevails, it will be because:
420	The police, suspecting that the defendant was dealing drugs, observed several people walk up to the defendant's door, knock on his door, and then exchange cash for small packages that the police believed contained drugs. Two uniformed police officers then walked up to the door and knocked. The defendant answered the door, and one police officer asked if they could come in and take a look around. The defendant, believing that he had no other choice but to let the officers inside, agreed. Once inside, they discovered equipment used for making methamphetamine and several tablets of methamphetamine that were sitting on a table covered by a bed sheet. One officer promptly arrested and handcuffed the defendant while the other seized the equipment and tablets. Prior to his trial for the illegal manufacture and possession of methamphetamine, the defendant moved to suppress the evidence as having been illegally seized. The motion should be:
421	During the defendant's prosecution for burglary, the prosecution called a witness to the stand and asked: "After the defendant left the room, what did the defendant's friend say to you, if anything?" Previous evidence had established that the defendant and his friend had agreed, prior to the time the defendant left the room, to burglarize a jewelry store. The defense counsel said "Objection!" but the court overruled the objection. The witness then testified about what the friend said. If the defense counsel wishes to complain about the court's ruling in this matter on appeal, what more should she do before the trial concludes?
422	A yogurt manufacturer sold one of its small, underperforming dairy farms to a farmer for a reduced price. The sale contract provided that the yogurt manufacturer would purchase all of the milk produced by the farm during the next five years at the current market price at time of delivery, delivery and payment to be made at weekly intervals, and the farmer agreed to supply in any event a minimum of 1,000 gallons of milk per month during that period. When the sale was closed, the yogurt manufacturer's lawyer handed the farmer's lawyer a letter stating: "This is to notify you that we will take all of your milk production until further notice." For one year, the farmer delivered to the yogurt manufacturer and the yogurt manufacturer paid for all of the milk produced at the farm. During that year, the farmer increased his milk production by 100% by increasing the number and productivity of the cows. The farmer then proposed to the yogurt manufacturer that, since he had doubled production, it would only be fair that he supply the yogurt manufacturer with half of his new total, but in any event a minimum of 1,000 gallons per month, leaving the farmer free to sell the remainder of the milk at higher prices for other uses. The yogurt manufacturer, in a signed writing, agreed to the proposal by the farmer for the remaining period of the original contract. The modification between the yogurt manufacturer and the farmer reducing the contractual amounts by 50% was:
423	Harry met Bill, who was known to him to be a burglar, in a bar. Harry told Bill that he needed money. He promised to pay Bill $500 if Bill would go to Harry's house the following night and take some silverware. Harry explained to Bill that, although the silverware was legally his, his wife would object to his selling it. Harry pointed out his home, one of a group of similar tract houses. He drew a floor plan of the house that showed the location of the silverware. Harry said that his wife usually took several sleeping pills before retiring, and that he would make sure that she took them the next night. He promised to leave a window unlocked. Everything went according to the plan except that Bill, deceived by the similarity of the tract houses, went to the wrong house. He found a window unlocked, climbed in and found silver where Harry had indicated. He took the silver to the cocktail lounge where the payoff was to take place. At that point the police arrested the two men. If Harry were charged with burglary, his best argument for acquittal would be that
424	Wastrel, a notorious spendthrift who was usually broke for that reason, received the following letter from his Uncle Bullion, a wealthy and prudent man: "I understand you're in financial difficulties again. I promise to give you $5,000 on your birthday next month, but you'd better use it wisely or you'll never get another dime from me." Wastrel thereupon signed a contract with a car dealer to purchase a $40,000 automobile and to make a $5,000 down payment on the day after his birthday. If Wastrel sues Bullion for $5,000 after the latter learned of the car-purchase contract and then repudiated his promise, which of the following is Bullion's best defense?
425	Duffer and Slicker, who lived in different suburbs twenty miles apart, were golfing acquaintances at the Interurban Country Club. Both were traveling salesmen-Duffer for a pharmaceutical house and Slicker for a widget manufacturer. Duffer wrote Slicker by United States mail on Friday, October 8: I need a motorcycle for transportation to the country club, and will buy your Sujocki for $1,200 upon your bringing it to my home address above [stated in the letterhead] on or beforenoon, November 12 next. This offer is not subject to countermand. Sincerely, [signed] Duffer Slicker replied by mail the following day: I accept your offer, and promise to deliver the bike as you specified. Sincerely, [signed] Slicker This letter, although properly addressed, was misdirected by the postal service and not received by Duffer until November 10. Duffer had bought another Sujocki bike from Koolcat for $1,050 a few hours before. Koolcat saw Slicker at the Interurban Country Club on November I I and said: " I sold my Sujocki to Duffer yesterday for $1,050. Would you consider selling me yours for $950?" Slicker replied: "I'll let you know in a few days." On November 12, Slicker took his Sujocki to Duffer's residence; he arrived at 11:55 a.m. Duffer was asleep and did not answer Slicker's doorbell rings until 12:15 p.m. Duffer than rejected Slicker's bike on the ground that he had already bought Koolcat's. In Duffer's letter of October 8, what was the legal effect of the language: "This offer is not subject to countermand"?
426	On April 1, a graduate student who owned an antique dictionary agreed to sell it to a buyer for $1,500. The written contract between the seller and the buyer provided that the dictionary would not be delivered to the buyer until April 20. Late on April 15, a fire swept through the seller's apartment building, through no fault of the seller, and the dictionary was destroyed. Fortunately for the seller, he had insurance that covered all of his damages, including compensation for the destroyed dictionary. On April 20, the seller told the buyer of the fire, but still demanded payment, claiming that the buyer was the equitable owner of the dictionary when it was destroyed, and told her that she could have obtained insurance on the dictionary had she wanted to, because she had an insurable interest in the dictionary as soon as the contract was made. The buyer refused to pay. The seller brings an action against the buyer for the $1,500. Who will prevail?
427	An insured purchased a life insurance policy on his life, naming his brother as beneficiary. Fifteen years ago, the insured traveled overseas on what was supposed to be a six-month trip, but has not been heard from since. The brother contacted the insurance company, which refused to pay the claim on the basis that there was no evidence that the insured was dead. The brother filed suit against the insurance company to collect the proceeds under the policy. The jurisdiction in which the action has commenced has a statute that states that a person is presumed dead if missing from the jurisdiction for seven years, and if no one in the jurisdiction has heard from the person in those seven years. Assume that no other evidence is admitted at the trial on the issue of the insured's death. Which of the following is the most accurate statement?
428	Constance owned Greenacre in fee simple. She executed two instruments in the proper form of deeds. The first instrument purported to convey an undivided one-half interest in Greenacre to Henry and his wife, Audrey, as joint tenants with right of survivorship. The second instrument purported to convey an undivided one-half interest in Greenacre to Susan, the only child of Henry. Susan was thirteen years old at the time. The commonlaw joint tenancy is unmodified by statute. No actual consideration was paid for the deeds. Constance handed the two deeds to Henry. Henry promptly and properly recorded the deed to himself and Audrey and put the deed to his daughter, Susan, in a safe-deposit box without recording it. The same year, Henry, Audrey, and Susan were on a vacation when the plane in which they were flying went down, and all three were killed simultaneously. Henry, Audrey, and Susan died intestate. The applicable statute in the jurisdiction provides that "when title to property on its devolution depends on priority of death and there is insufficient evidence that the persons have died otherwise than simultaneously, the property of each person shall be disposed of as if he had survived." An appropriate action was instituted by the heirs of Henry, Audrey, and Susan. Constance, who is not an heir of any of the deceased, was a party to the action. The court should determine that title to Greenacre is
429	A group of parents advocating abstinence among teenagers developed a seminar that it presents to middle school students throughout the country. The seminar includes lectures by trained professionals accompanied by slides, some of which depict explicit sexual activity between nude males and females. Parents are required to give their consent before any child may participate. A school administrator invited the group to present its program. However, a law in the state in which the school is located provides in its entirety, "It is unlawful to sell, give, or display to any person under the age of 17 any lewd or obscene article, picture, or depiction." The district attorney for the district in which the school is located learned of the planned presentation and threatened to prosecute the school's administrative board and program's presenter under the state statute if they carried out the planned program. If the school's administrators seek relief in federal court, which of the following statements regarding the likely result of the case is correct?
430	Mom rushed her eight-year-old daughter, Child, to the emergency room at Hospital after Child fell off her bicycle and hit her head on a sharp rock. The wound caused by the fall was extensive and bloody. Mom was permitted to remain in the treatment room, and held Child's hand while the emergency room physician cleaned and sutured the wound. During the procedure, Mom said that she was feeling faint and stood up to leave the room. While leaving the room, Mom fainted and, in falling, struck her head on a metal fixture that protruded from the emergency room wall. She sustained a serious injury as a consequence. If Mom sues Hospital to recover damages for her injury, will she prevail?
431	A construction company was employed by the city to repair a broken pipe under a main street of the city. As part of its work, the construction company dug a deep trench down the center of the street. Warning signs and flashing lights were positioned at both ends of the trench to warn cars of the danger, but, except for two unlit warning signs along the sides, no barriers of any kind were put up on either side. A college student was walking home from the bus depot along the same street after dark. A heavy rain started, and in an effort to avoid getting more drenched, the student jaywalked instead of going to the corner to cross the street, which was empty of traffic at the time. In the dark and the heavy rain, the student did not realize that the road was dug up where he was crossing and fell into the trench. The student was knocked out when he hit the bottom of the trench and drowned when the water from the rain gathered at the bottom. The student's mother brought a wrongful death action against the construction company for the death of her son. The jurisdiction retains traditional contributory negligence rules and has a statute that makes it a misdemeanor for anyone to cross a main street such as this at any place except in the marked crosswalks. The construction company is likely to:
432	A ballplayer became ill soon after consuming sunflower seeds marketed by a farm products company. The package of seeds was inspected and foreign matter was discovered on the seeds. If the ballplayer brings an action against the farm products company on the basis of strict tort liability, which of the following would be most helpful for the company to avoid liability?
433	A grantor executed a valid deed conveying a tract of land to a city "for the purpose of constructing a planetarium thereon." The city held the property for a number of years, but decided on another site for the planetarium. When presented an offer to purchase the property by a privately owned garbage collection company, the city accepted and conveyed the land to the company. Which of the following statements about the title of the tract of land is true?
434	A jurisdiction has the following decisional law on questions of principal and accomplice liability: CASE A: Defendant, a hardware store owner, sold several customers an item known as a "SuperTrucker," which detects police radar and enables speeders to avoid detection. When one of the devices broke down and the speeder was arrested, he confessed that he often sped, secure in the knowledge that his "SuperTrucker" would warn him of police radar in the vicinity. Held: Defendant guilty as an accomplice to speeding. CASE B: Defendant told Arnold that Defendant had stored some stereo equipment in a self-storage locker. He gave Arnold a key and asked Arnold to pick up the equipment and deliver it to Defendant's house. Arnold complied, and removed the equipment from the locker, using the key. In fact, the equipment belonged to Defendant's neighbor, whose locker key Defendant had found in the driveway. Held: Defendant guilty as an accomplice to burglary. CASE C: Tooley, a city council member, accepted a bribe from Defendant in exchange for his vote on Defendant's application for a zoning variance. A statute prohibits the taking of bribes by public officials. Held: Defendant not guilty as an accomplice to Tooley's violation of the bribery statute. CASE D: Defendant, an innkeeper, sometimes let his rooms to prostitutes, whom he knew to be using the rooms to ply their trade. He charged the prostitutes the same price as other guests at his inn. Held: Defendant not guilty as an accomplice to prostitution. Lipsky, a college student, purchased narcotics from Speed, whom he believed to be a "street person" but who was in fact an undercover police agent. Lipsky has been charged as an accomplice to the sale of narcotics. He should be
435	While working on a construction project, a plaintiff was injured when a heavy object struck his knee. Although the plaintiff was fully compensated for his injuries at the time of the incident, he now seeks disability payments from the construction company because he has developed arthritis in the same knee. The construction company claims that the arthritis has nothing to do with the plaintiff's on-the-job injury and refuses to pay him disability money. The plaintiff sues. A doctor takes the stand to testify for the plaintiff. He is qualified as an expert witness and during direct examination states that in his opinion the blow to the plaintiff's knee caused his arthritis. On cross-examination, the construction company's attorney produces a treatise on arthritis and asks the doctor if the treatise is considered to be authoritative. The doctor responds that the treatise is a standard authority in the field, but that he did not rely on it in forming his professional opinion regarding the plaintiff's condition. The attorney then seeks to introduce into evidence a statement in the treatise that "the idea that arthritis can be caused by a single traumatic event is purely folklore, although it is widely believed by the ignorant who have no scientific basis for their beliefs." The plaintiff's attorney objects. The court should find the statement from the treatise:
436	Spender owed Midas $1,000, plus interest at 8% until paid, on a long-overdue promissory note, collection of which would become barred by the statute of limitations on June 30. On the preceding April 1, Spender and Midas both signed a writing in which Spender promised to pay the note in full on the following December 31, plus interest at 8% until that date, and Midas promised not to sue on the note in the meantime. Midas, having received some advice from his nonlawyer brother-in-law, became concerned about the legal effect of the April 1 agreement. On May 1, acting pro se as permitted by the rules of the local small claims court, he filed suit to collect the note. Assuming that there is no controlling statute, is the April 1 agreement an effective defense for Spender?
437	A state statute requires the permanent removal from parental custody of any child who has suffered "child abuse." That term is defined to include "corporal punishment of any sort." Zeller very gently spanks his six-year-old son on the buttocks whenever he believes that spanking is necessary to enforce discipline on him. Such a spanking occurs not more than once a month and has never physically harmed the child. The state files suit under the statute to terminate Zeller's parental rights solely because of these spankings. Zeller defends only on the ground that the statute in question is unconstitutional as applied to his admitted conduct. In light of the nature of the rights involved, which of the following is the most probable burden of persuasion on this constitutional issue?
438	A victim was raped and beaten by the defendant. The victim called the police and provided an accurate description of the defendant, who was arrested shortly thereafter and charged with the attack. After the attack, the victim was examined by her physician. When the defendant came to trial, the victim refused to cooperate with the prosecution and steadfastly refused to testify against the defendant. To establish that the victim was raped and beaten, the prosecution put the physician on the stand, planning to have him testify as to the victim's physical condition after the attack and as to how she said she received her injuries. The victim wishes to prevent the physician from so testifying by invoking the jurisdiction's physician-patient privilege, which applies to both civil and criminal proceedings. Under which of the following circumstances is the court least likely to allow the victim to use the physician-patient privilege to keep the physician from testifying?
439	On March 1, a widget manufacturer and a retailer entered into a written contract whereby the manufacturer agreed to sell and the retailer agreed to buy 10,000 widgets at a price of $10,000. Due to slow sales, the manufacturer was operating its factory at only 50% capacity and had ample inventory on hand. Delivery and payment was set for May 1. On April 1, the retailer told the manufacturer that he had no need for the widgets after all and would not accept delivery of them on May 1. After notice to the retailer, the manufacturer sold the widgets to another buyer a week later for $11,000, the market price at the time. On May 1, the market price of the widgets dropped to $8,000. The manufacturer's cost to produce and deliver the widgets was $7,000. The manufacturer sued for breach of contract. At the time of the trial, the market price of widgets was $9,000. The court ruled in the manufacturer's favor, and found that its sale of the widgets to the subsequent buyer was done in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, and that there were no incidental damages or expenses saved as a result of the breach. What amount of damages should the court award to the manufacturer?

This quotation is basically a statement of the
441	A written construction contract began with the following recital: "This Agreement, between Land, Inc. (hereafter called 'Owner'), and Builder, Inc., and Boss, its President (hereafter called 'Contractor'), witnesseth:" The signatures to the contract appeared in the following format: LAND, INC. By /s/ Oscar Land President BUILDER, INC. By /s/ George Mason Vice President /s/ Mary Boss, President Mary Boss Builder, Inc., became insolvent and defaulted. Land, Inc., sued Boss individually for the breach, and at the trial Boss proffered evidence from the pre-contract negotiations that only Builder, Inc., was to be legally responsible for performing the contract. If the court finds the contract to be completely integrated, is Boss's proffered evidence admissible?
442	Hydro-King, Inc., a high-volume, pleasureboat retailer, entered into a written contract with Zuma, signed by both parties, to sell Zuma a power boat for $12,000. The manufacturer's price of the boat delivered to Hydro-King was $9,500. As the contract provided, Zuma paid Hydro-King $4,000 in advance and promised to pay the full balance upon delivery of the boat. The contract contained no provision for liquidated damages. Prior to the agreed delivery date, Zuma notified Hydro-King that he would be financially unable to conclude the purchase; and Hydro-King thereupon resold the same boat that Zuma had ordered to a third person for $12,000 cash. If Zuma sues Hydro-King for restitution of the $4,000 advance payment, which of the following should the court decide?
443	In 1960 Omar, the owner in fee simple absolute, conveyed Stoneacre, a five-acre tract of land. The relevant, operative words of the deed conveyed to "Church [a duly organized religious body having power to hold property] for the life of my son, Carl, and from and after the death of my said son, Carl, to all of my grandchildren and their heirs and assigns In equal shares; provided, Church shall use the premises for church purposes only." In an existing building on Stoneacre, Church immediately began to conduct religious services and other activities normally associated with a church. In 1975, Church granted to Darin a right to remove sand and gravel from a one-half acre portion of Stoneacre upon the payment of royalty. Darin has regularly removed sand and gravel since 1975 and paid royalty to Church. Church has continued ro conduct religious services and other church activities on Stoneacre. All four of the living grandchildren of Omar, joined by a guardian ad litem to represent unborn grandchildren, instituted suit against Church and Darin seeking damages for the removal of sand and gravel and an injunction preventing further acts of removal. There is no applicable statute. Which of the following best describes the likely disposition of this lawsuit?
444	Lawnacre was conveyed to Celeste and Donald by a deed which, in the jurisdiction in which Lawn. acre is situated, created a cotenancy in equal shares and with the right of survivorship. The jurisdiction has no statute directly applicable to any of the problems posed. Celeste, by deed, conveyed "my undivided one-half interest in Lawnacre" to Paul. Celeste has since died. In an appropriate action between Paul and Donald in which title to Lawnacre is at issue, Donald will
445	Client consulted Lawyer about handling the sale of Client's building, and asked Lawyer what her legal fee would be. Lawyer replied that her usual charge was $100 per hour, and estimated that the legal work on behalf of Client would cost about $5,000 at that rate. Client said, "Okay; let's proceed with it," and Lawyer timely and successfully completed the work. Because of unexpected title problems, Lawyer reasonably spent 75 hours on the matter and shortly thereafter mailed Client a bill for $7,500, with a letter itemizing the work performed and time spent. Client responded by a letter expressing his good-faith belief that Lawyer had agreed to a total fee of no more than $5,000. Client enclosed a check in the amount of $5,000 payable to Lawyer and conspicuously marked, "Payment in full for legal services in connection with the sale of Client's building." Despite reading the "Payment in full..." language, Lawyer, without any notation of protest or reservation of rights, endorsed and deposited the check to her bank account. The check was duly paid by Client's bank. A few days later, Lawyer unsuccessfully demanded payment from Client of the $2,500 difference between the amount of her bill and the check, and now sues Client for that difference. What, if anything, can Lawyer recover from Client?
446	Hoping to gain a position on a campaign staff, an unemployed law student sent a detailed outline of a campaign strategy to a candidate for Congress. The candidate turned the materials over to his campaign manager, who advised the candidate to adopt some of them in his commercials. The candidate wrote the law student, thanking him for his interest in the campaign and stating that although he had a campaign staff and strategy in place, some of the ideas were good and he adopted them. He added, "To say 'thanks' to a future constituent, I'd like to offer to pay you for your expenses in developing the materials you sent me. Send the bill to my campaign headquarters." Nevertheless, the candidate lost the election. One week after election day, the law student's bill for $1,500 arrived at the candidate's campaign headquarters. Campaign debts were high, and the candidate told his campaign manager not to pay the bill. The law student filed suit against the candidate to obtain payment of the bill plus an additional $10,000 for his ideas. What additional fact, if true, would most strengthen the candidate's defense against the law student's suit?
447	A defendant who was indigent was charged with a crime for which the maximum punishment is six months in prison and a fine of $500. At a hearing, the defendant told the judge that he wanted to plead not guilty and that he wished to represent himself. The judge told the defendant that the court would appoint an attorney to represent him if he needed counsel. He further explained that the state has a policy of appointing private attorneys to defend indigents, and that if such defendants are acquitted or imprisoned, there is no charge for the courtappointed lawyer. If, however, the defendant is sentenced to probation, the defendant must pay "reasonable attorneys' fees," which it is presumed the defendant will be able to pay out of job earnings while on probation. The defendant told the judge that paying for an attorney would be difficult, and that he still wished to defend himself. The judge believed that the defendant was competent toadefend himself, but nevertheless appointed an attorney with criminal defense experience to defend him. The defendant fully cooperated with the attorney, who did a highly competent job, but the evidence heavily favored the state. The defendant was convicted, but the attorney's plea for leniency was effective, and the defendant received a suspended sentence and probation. Two weeks later, the defendant received a bill for $500 for legal services, a figure that represented about half the sum a lawyer not appointed by the court would have charged for similar work. Although the defendant would be able to pay the bill over a long period of time via installments, he was angry that he had been billed at all, and believed that he could have gotten probation if he had been allowed to argue his own case. He consulted another attorney, and asked her to appeal both his conviction and the imposition of the legal fees. The second attorney should advise the defendant that the appellate court would most likely:
448	A newspaper printed in a news article that a successful businessman running for the state legislature had attempted suicide and had just been released from the hospital, where he had undergone intensive psychotherapy. Actually, the businessman had been hospitalized because he had contracted hepatitis. The businessman's opponent, the incumbent legislator, read the story into the legislative record the next day. The businessman sued the incumbent for defamation. At trial, the businessman established that the incumbent had serious doubts as to the accuracy of the story when she read it into the record. The businessman will likely:
449	Pursuant to a state statute, Clovis applied for tuition assistance to attend the Institute of Liberal Arts. He was qualified for such assistance in every way except that he was a resident alien who did not intend to become a United States citizen. The state's restriction of such grants to United States citizens or resident aliens seeking such citizenship is probably
450	A plaintiff brought an action in federal court against a state government, seeking monetary damages. The state moved to have the case dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, citing the Eleventh Amendment of the United States Constitution. Which of the following facts would support a denial of the state's motion?
451	During 1976 a series of arsons, one of which damaged the Humongous Store, occurred in the City of Swelter. In early 1977 Swelter's City Council adopted this resolution: The City will pay $10,000 for the arrest and conviction of anyone guilty of any of the 1976 arsons committed here. The foregoing was telecast by the city's sole television station once daily for one week. Subsequently, Humongous, by a written memorandum to Gimlet, a private detective, proposed to pay Gimlet $200 "for each day 's work you actually perform in investigating our fire." Thereafter, in August, 1977, the City Council by resolution repealed its reward offer and caused this resolution to be broadcast once daily for a week over two local radio stations, the local television station having meanwhile ceased operations. In September, 1977, a Humongous employee voluntarily confessed to Gimlet to having committed all of the 1976 arsons. Humongous' president thereupon paid Gimlet at the proposed daily rate for his investigation and suggested that Gimlet also claim the city's reward, of which Gimlet had been previously unaware. Gimlet immediately made the claim. In December, 1977, as a result of Gimlet's investigation, the Humongous employee was convicted of burning the store. The city, which has no immunity to suit, has since refused to pay Gimlet anything, although he swears that he never heard of the city's repealer before claiming its reward. In a suit by Gimlet against the city to recover the $10,000 reward, which of the following, in light of the facts given, most usefully supports Gimlet's claim?
452	In a personal injury action, a doctor sat in court and listened to all of the evidence regarding the plaintiff's injuries. The defense subsequently calls that doctor to testify as to his opinion about whether the plaintiff's injuries will prevent the plaintiff from ever working again. May the doctor testify to this?
453	A builder contracted with a landowner to construct a house on the landowner's property for a contract price of $100,000. The landowner committed a total breach of the contract at a time when the builder had already incurred costs of part performance of $30,000 and would have to spend an additional $60,000 to finish the job. The builder is entitled to recovery in the amount of:
454	A state adopted a statute requiring all public school students to recite the Pledge of Allegiance. A parent of a public school student objected to the requirement because the Pledge includes the words, "under God." The parent brought suit in state court, seeking an injunction based on an alleged violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, as applied to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In deciding the substance of the parent's claim, which of the following factors would be most relevant?
455	Congress provides by statute that any state that fails to prohibit automobile speeds of over 55 miles per hour on highways within the state shall be denied all federal highway construction funding. The state of Atlantic, one of the richest and most highway-oriented states in the country, refuses to enact such a statute. The federal statute relating to disbursement of highway funds conditioned on the 55 mile-an-hour speed limit is probably
456	An uncle who owned a large tract of wooded land in fee simple had always opened his land to hunters from the local hunting club, and had often expressed the wish that they be permitted to continue to use it after he died. On his 75th birthday, he conveyed the land to his niece and nephew, who were members of the hunting club. The deed was a general warranty deed conveying the property in fee simple absolute. A few days later, the niece had a serious dispute with the nephew and the other members of the hunting club, and she quit the club. The uncle then executed a written agreement with the nephew stating that the conveyance of the land to the niece and nephew was in trust for the benefit of the local hunting club for a period of 10 years, with the niece and nephew as trustees, and then to the niece and nephew in fee simple. Several months later, the uncle died. When the next hunting season drew near, the nephew told the niece that members of the hunting club were once again planning to hunt on the property. The niece threatened to have anyone hunting on the property other than the nephew arrested for trespassing. The nephew brought an action for appropriate legal or equitable relief to establish his rights and the rights of the hunting club. What, if any, relief should the court provide?
457	A comprehensive federal health-care reform statute created a Federal Health Policy Board, which was directed to monitor the fees charged for various medical procedures covered by insurance. The board also had the power to subpoena records to determine whether fee increases were a true reflection of cost increases. Nothing in the statute provided for caps on fee increases. Because of the continuing escalation of health-care costs while the statute was being debated, several states had passed health-care legislation on their own. One state passed legislation that prohibited most fee increases of 10% or more per year for specified health-care services covered by insurance, and created a health-care review board to regulate these costs and impose monetary penalties on health-care providers or insurers that tried to circumvent the cap. Which of the following would be the best basis for finding the state provision unconstitutional?
458	A state statute contains the following provisions: Murder in the first degree is the killing of a human being without justification and with premeditation. Murder in the second degree is any murder which is neither a murder in the first degree nor a murder in the third degree. Murder in the third degree is any killing that occurs during and as a result of the commission of a felony. The jurisdiction also provides that robbery is a felony for purposes of the felony murder rule. A robber held up a convenience store with a knife. After the store clerk handed over all the money in the register, she retrieved a pistol from a drawer behind the counter. When the robber turned to leave, the store clerk pointed the gun at the robber and shouted, "Stop or I'll shoot!" The robber ducked behind the end of an aisle, and the store clerk shot three times in the robber's direction. One of the bullets bounced off a pillar and struck the only other customer in the store, who was crouched behind a counter, killing him instantly. The crimes below are listed in descending order of seriousness. The most serious homicide crime of which the store clerk can be convicted is:
459	Employer retained Doctor to evaluate medical records of prospective employees. Doctor informed Employer that Applicant, a prospective employee, suffered from AIDS. Employer informed Applicant of this and declined to hire her. Applicant was shocked by this news and suffered a heart attack as a result. Subsequent tests revealed that Applicant in fact did not have AIDS. Doctor had negligently confused Applicant's file with that of another prospective employee. If Applicant sued Doctor for damages, on which of the following causes of action would Applicant recover? I. Invasion of privacy. II. Negligent misrepresentation. III. Negligent infliction of emotional distress.
460	A man loaned $10,000 to his good friend who was heavily in debt. He told his friend that he could have until the following June to repay the loan and to make repayment directly to the man's grandson. The man knew that his grandson, who would be graduating from law school in June, was hoping to buy a new car upon graduation and could use the money as a down payment on the car. Neither the man nor his friend told the grandson of this agreement. Before the friend repaid the $10,000 loan, the grandson went out and bought his dream car, cashing some savings bonds to make the down payment. A week later, the grandfather suffered a reversal of fortune and told his friend to pay the $10,000 to him after all, which the friend did. A short time later, the grandson learned of the aborted plan to pay the $10,000 to him. If the grandson sues the friend for the $10,000, will he prevail?
461	Ollie owned a large tract of land known as Peterhill. During Ollie's lifetime, Ollie conveyed the easterly half (East Peterhill), situated in the municipality of Hawthorn, to Abel, and the westerly half (West Peterhill), situated in the municipality of Sycamore, to Betty. Each of the conveyances, which were promptly and properly recorded, contained the following language: The parties agree for themselves and their heirs and assigns that the premises herein conveyed shall be used only for residential purposes; that each lot created within the premises herein conveyed shall contain not less than five acres; and that each lot shall have not more than one single-family dwelling. This agreement shall bind all successor owners of all or any portion of Peterhill and any owner of any part of Peterhill may enforce this covenant. After Ollie's death, Abel desired to build houses on one-half acre lots in the East Peterhill tract as authorized by current applicable zoning and building codes in Hawthorn. The area surrounding East Peterhill in Hawthorn was developed as a residential community with homes built on one-half acre lots. West Peterhill was in a residential area covered by the Sycamore zoning code, which allowed residential development only on five-acre tracts of land. In an appropriate action brought by Betty to enjoin Abel's proposed construction on one- half acre lots, the court will find the quoted restriction to be
462	A father drew up a deed conveying his land to his son. The father never recorded the deed and left it in the top drawer of his desk in his study. Two years later, the father died. He left a will, which declared that all of his property be divided equally between the son and the father's daughter. While going through his father's personal effects, the son discovered the deed to the land. He showed the deed to his sister and the two of them agreed not to record the deed. The son put the deed in a desk drawer in his home. A year later, the son died. As the executor perused the son's personal papers, he came across the deed and promptly recorded it. He then entered into a contract to sell the land to a buyer. The daughter discovered this and promptly filed suit, claiming an interest in the land. A statute of the jurisdiction provides: "No conveyance is good against a subsequent purchaser for value, without notice, who first records." The court will rule:
463	A city passed an ordinance prohibiting persons on a public sidewalk within 100 feet of a health care facility from approaching within eight feet of those seeking access to the facility for purposes of protest, education, or counseling. The day after the city's new ordinance became effective, a person advocating against abortion went to an abortion clinic within the city, stood 25 feet from its entrance, stopped the first woman whom she saw about to enter the clinic, and gave her a leaflet espousing the leafletter's religious views and discouraging abortion. The leafletter was promptly arrested for violating the city's ordinance. At trial, the leafletter challenges the ordinance on First Amendment grounds. How should the court rule on the leafletter's First Amendment defense?
464	After reading an article in a hunting magazine detailing a state's expanded season for the hunting of grizzly bears, a hunter called his nephew to see if he wanted to take a trip to the state to hunt grizzly bears. His nephew agreed. Unknown to the hunter and his nephew, the article in the magazine listed an incorrect ending date for the expanded grizzly bear hunting season; the hunting season had expired the day before. While still in their pickup truck driving to a campsite in the state, the hunter and his nephew were pulled over by a state trooper. They volunteered that they were on their way to hunt grizzly bears and were promptly arrested. A state statute made hunting bears out of season a strict liability offense. If the hunter and his nephew are charged with conspiracy to hunt grizzly bears out of season, they will be:
465	Alice conveyed Twinoaks Farm "to Barbara, her heirs and assigns, so long as the premises are used for residential and farm purposes, then to Charles and his heirs and assigns." The jurisdiction in which Twinoaks Farm is located has adopted the common-law Rule Against Perpetuities unmodified by statute. As a consequence of the conveyance, Alice's interest in Twinoaks Farm is
466	At the defendant's trial for rape, he calls a witness who testifies that she was on her patio barbecuing some hamburgers at the time of the charged rape and saw the assailant run from the victim's apartment. She further testifies that the person who ran from the victim's apartment was not the defendant. On cross-examination by the prosecutor, to which of the following questions would a defense objection most likely be sustained?
467	A son was furious when his father sold some property that he had promised to bequeath to the son in his will. The son instituted proceedings to have his father committed to a psychiatric facility. The son testified falsely at trial that his father was addicted to prescription medicines and had abused the son and other family members when the son was a child. The administrative judge presiding over the trial did not believe the son's testimony and found the father competent. As a result of the testimony, the father suffered severe distress and anxiety. If the father sues his son for intentional infliction of emotional distress due to the son's testimony, who is likely to prevail?
468	On January 1, Awl and Howser agreed in writing that Awl would build a house on Howser's lot according to Howser's plans and specifications for $60,000, the work to commence on April 1. Howser agreed to make an initial payment of $10,000 on April 1, and to pay the balance upon completion of the work. On February 1, Awl notified Howser that he (Awl) would lose money on the job at that price, and would not proceed with the work unless Howser would agree to increase the price to $90,000. Howser thereupon, without notifying Awl, agreed in writing with Gutter for Gutter, commencing April 1, to build the house for $75,000, which was the fair market cost of the work to be done. On April 1, both Awl and Gutter showed up at the building site to begin work, Awl telling Howser that he had decided to "take the loss" and would build the house for $60,000 as originally agreed. Howser dismissed Awl and allowed Gutter to begin work on the house. For this question only, assume that Awl is liable to Howser for breach of contract and also assume the following additional facts: Gutter finished the house on schedule and then showed Howser that he (Gutter) had spent $85,000 on the job. Howser thereupon paid Gutter the full balance of their contract price plus an additional $10,000, so that Gutter would not lose money. In a contract action by Howser against Awl, Howser will recover
469	While negligently driving his father's uninsured automobile, 25-year-old Arthur crashed into an automobile driven by Betty. Both Arthur and Betty were injured. Charles, Arthur's father, erroneously believing that he was liable because he owned the automobile, said to Betty: "I will see to it that you are reimbursed for any losses you incur as a result of the accident." Charles also called Physician and told him to take care of Betty, and that he, Charles, would pay the bill. Arthur, having no assets, died as a result of his injuries. Dodge, one of Arthur's creditors, wrote to Charles stating that Arthur owed him a clothing bill of $200 and that he was going to file a claim against Arthur's estate. Charles replied: "If you don't file a claim against Arthur's estate, I will pay what he owed you." In an action by Betty against Charles for wages lost while she was incapacitated as a result of the accident, which of the following would be Charles's best defense?
470	Suspecting that Scott had slain his wife, police detectives persuaded one of Scott's employees to remove a drinking glass from Scott's office so that it could be used for fingerprint comparisons with a knife found near the body. The fingerprints matched. The prosecutor announced that he would present comparisons and evidence to the grand jury. Scott's lawyer immediately filed a motion to suppress the evidence of the fingerprint comparisons to bar its consideration by the grand jury, contending that the evidence was illegally acquired. The motion should be
471	A defendant is on trial for a federal offense. The government has subpoenaed crucial documents from the defendant's bookkeeper that will clearly incriminate the defendant. May the defendant invoke her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination to prevent the documents from being admitted?
472	Owen owned Blackacre in fee simple, as the land records showed, when he contracted to sell Blackacre to Bryer. Two weeks later, Bryer paid the agreed price and received a warranty deed. A week thereafter, when neither the contract nor the deed had been recorded and while Owen remained in possession of Blackacre, Cred properly filed her money judgment against Owen. She knew nothing of Bryer's interest. A statute in the jurisdiction provides: "Any judgment properly filed shall, for ten years from filing, be a lien on the real property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person against whom the judgment is rendered." The recording act of the jurisdiction provides: "No conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value and without notice unless the same be recorded according to law." Cred brought an appropriate action to enforce her lien against Blackacre in Bryer's hands. If the court decides for Bryer, it will most probably be because
473	Elda, the aged mother of Alice and Barry, both adults, wished to employ a live-in companion so that she might continue to live in her own home. Elda, however, had only enough income to pay one-half of the companion's $2,000 monthly salary. Learning of their mother's plight, Alice and Barry agreed with each other in a signed writing that on the last day of January and each succeeding month during their mother's lifetime, each would give Elda $500. Elda then hired the companion. Alice and Barry made the agreed payments in January, February, and March. In April, however, Barry refused to make any payment and notified Alice and Elda that he would make no further payments. Will Elda succeed in an action for $500 brought against Barry after April 30?
474	State X enacted a statute "to regulate administratively the conduct of motor vehicle junkyard businesses in order to deter motor vehicle theft and trafficking in stolen motor vehicles or parts thereof." The statute requires a junkyard owner or operator "to permit representatives of the Department of Motor Vehicles or of any law enforcement agency upon request during normal business hours to take physical inventory of motor vehicles and parts thereof on the premises." The statute also states that a failure to comply with any of its requirements constitutes a felony. Police officers assigned to Magnolia City's Automobile Crimes Unit periodically visited all motor vehicle junkyards in town to make the inspections permitted by the statute. Janet owned such a business in Magnolia City. One summer day, the officers asked to inspect the vehicles on her lot. Janet said, "Do I have a choice?" The officers told her she did not. The officers conducted their inspection and discovered three stolen automobiles. Janet is charged with receiving stolen property. Janet moves pretrial to suppress the evidence relating to the three automobiles on the ground that the inspection was unconstitutional. Her motion should be
475	In a narcotics conspiracy prosecution against Daly, the prosecutor offers in evidence a tape recording of a telephone call allegedly made by Daly. A lay witness is called to testify that the voice on the recording is Daly's. Her testimony to which of the following would be the LEAET sufficient basis for admitting the recording?
476	Donna was arrested and taken to police headquarters, where she was given her Miranda warnings. Donna indicated that she wished to telephone her lawyer and was told that she could do so after her fingerprints had been taken. While being fingerprinted, however, Donna blurted out, "Paying a lawyer is a waste of money because I know you have me." At trial, Donna's motion to prevent the introduction of the statement she made while being fingerprinted will most probably be
477	A defendant was arrested for the felony of aggravated battery against a victim. A witness testified before a grand jury that the defendant was with her at a fundraiser at the time the victim claims she was beaten by the defendant. The grand jury refused to indict the defendant. The victim then sued the defendant for personal injuries. The witness could not be located. A second witness, who also attended the fundraiser, was produced and gave alibi testimony similar to that given by the first witness before the grand jury. The defendant's attorney offers as evidence, without prior notice to the victim's attorney, a properly authenticated transcript of the testimony given earlier by the first witness before the grand jury. The transcript of the grand jury testimony is:
478	Driver negligently drove his car into Pedestrian, breaking her leg. Pedestrian's leg was put in a cast, and she used crutches to get about. While shopping at Market, her local supermarket, Pedestrian nonnegligently placed one of her crutches on a banana peel that had been negligently left on the floor by the manager of Market's produce department. Pedestrian's crutch slipped on the peel, and she fell to the floor, breaking her arm. Had Pedestrian stepped on the banana peel at a time when she did not have to use crutches, she would have regained her balance. Pedestrian sued Driver and Market for her injuries. Pedestrian will be able to recover from
479	Dillon held up a gasoline station. During the robbery he shot and killed a customer who attempted to apprehend him. Dillon was prosecuted for premeditated murder and convicted. Thereafter, he was indicted for armed robbery of the station. Before the trial, his attorney moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that further proceedings were unconstitutional because of Dillon's prior conviction. The motion to dismiss should be
480	Adam's car sustained moderate damage in a collision with a car driven by Basher. The accident was caused solely by Basher's negligence. Adam's car was still drivable after the accident. Examining the car the next morning, Adam could see that a rear fender had to be replaced. He also noticed that gasoline had dripped onto the garage floor. The collision had caused a small leak in the gasoline tank. Adam then took the car to Mechanic, who owns and operates a body shop, and arranged with Mechanic to repair the damage. During their discussion Adam neglected to mention the gasoline leakage. Thereafter, while Mechanic was loosening some of the damaged material with a hammer, he caused a spark, igniting vapor and gasoline that had leaked from the fuel tank. Mechanic was severely burned. Mechanic has brought an action to recover damages against Adam and Basher. The jurisdiction has adopted a pure comparative negligence rule in place of the traditional common-law rule of contributory negligence. In this action, will Mechanic obtain a judgment against Adam?
481	A developer owned a 100-acre tract of land, which he subdivided into 200 single-family residences. All deeds contained a covenant that the property would be used only for residential purposes. Two years after the last lot was sold, the developer purchased the 50-acre tract of land adjoining the subdivision. The developer constructed another group of 100 single-family residences on this land. To ensure their marketability, the developer desired to sell them like homes in the original development, and, to that extent, intended that the deeds to the new homes contain the same restrictions as those in the original development and be enforceable in the same manner by owners in both developments. Will the developer be successful in this plan?
482	Mrs. Pence sued Duarte for shooting her husband from ambush. Mrs. Pence offers to testify that, the day before her husband was killed, he described to her a chance meeting with Duarte on the street in which Duarte said, "I'm going to blow your head off one of these days." The witness's testimony concerning her husband's statement is
483	Oxnard owned Goldacre, a tract of land, in fee simple. At a time when Goldacre was in the adverse possession of Amos, Eric obtained the oral permission of Oxnard to use as a road or driveway a portion of Goldacre to reach adjoining land, Twin Pines, which Eric owned in fee simple. Thereafter, during all times relevant to this problem, Eric used this road across Goldacre regularly for ingress and egress between Twin Pines and a public highway. Amos quit possession of Goldacre before acquiring title by adverse possession. Without any further communication between Oxnard and Eric, Eric continued to use the road for a total period, from the time he first began to use it, sufficient to acquire an easement by prescription. Oxnard then blocked the road and refused to permit its continued use. Eric brought suit to determine his right to continue use of the road. Eric should
484	The defendant is on trial for embezzlement. He does not take the stand. Which of the defendant's previous convictions is most likely to be admitted into evidence against him?
485	A grand jury indicted Alice on a charge of arson, and a valid warrant was issued for her arrest. Paul, a police officer, arrested Alice and informed her of what the warrant stated. However, hoping that Alice might say something incriminating, he did not give her Miranda warnings. He placed her in the back seat of his patrol car and was driving her to the police station when she said, "Look, I didn't mean to bum the building; it was an accident. I was just burning some papers in a wastebasket." At the station, after being given Miranda warnings, Alice stated she wished to remain silent and made no other statements. Alice moved to suppress the use of her statement to Paul as evidence on two grounds: first, that the statement was acquired without giving Miranda warnings, and second, that the police officer had deliberately elicited her incriminating statement after she was in custody. As to Alice's motion to suppress, the court should
486	A father was angry at his son's coach because the coach would never let the son into a game. In order to exact revenge, the father decided to plant an incendiary device on the coach's front porch. The father believed the device would start a fire that would destroy the coach's home and perhaps injure him as well. However, the father made a mistake while assembling the incendiary device, and it was impossible for the device to do any harm. When the device went off, it did nothing more than produce a foul odor. If the father is charged with attempted murder and attempted arson in a common law jurisdiction, which of the following decisions is most likely to be reached by the court?
487	Ashton owned Woodsedge, a tract used for commercial purposes, in fee simple and thereafter mortgaged it to First Bank. She signed a promissory note secured by a duly executed and recorded mortgage. There was no "due on sale" clause, that is, no provision that, upon sale, the whole balance then owing would become due and owing. Ashton conveyed Woodsedge to Beam "subject to a mortgage to First Bank, which the grantee assumes and agrees to pay." Beam conveyed Woodsedge to Carter "subject to an existing mortgage to First Bank." A copy of the note and the mortgage that secured it had been exhibited to each grantee. After Carter made three timely payments, no further payments were made by any party. In fact, the real estate had depreciated to a point where it was worth less than the debt. There is no applicable statute or regulation. In an appropriate foreclosure action, First Bank joined Ashton, Beam, and Carter as defendants. At the foreclosure sale, although the fair market value for Woodsedge in its depreciated state was obtained, a deficiency resulted. First Bank is entitled to collect a deficiency judgment against
488	Duffer and Slicker, who lived in different suburbs twenty miles apart, were golfing acquaintances at the Interurban Country Club. Both were traveling salesmen-Duffer for a pharmaceutical house and Slicker for a widget manufacturer. Duffer wrote Slicker by United States mail on Friday, October 8: I need a motorcycle for transportation to the country club, and will buy your Sujocki for $1,200 upon your bringing it to my home address above [stated in the letterhead] on or beforenoon, November 12 next. This offer is not subject to countermand. Sincerely, [signed] Duffer Slicker replied by mail the following day: I accept your offer, and promise to deliver the bike as you specified. Sincerely, [signed] Slicker This letter, although properly addressed, was misdirected by the postal service and not received by Duffer until November 10. Duffer had bought another Sujocki bike from Koolcat for $1,050 a few hours before. Koolcat saw Slicker at the Interurban Country Club on November I I and said: " I sold my Sujocki to Duffer yesterday for $1,050. Would you consider selling me yours for $950?" Slicker replied: "I'll let you know in a few days." On November 12, Slicker took his Sujocki to Duffer's residence; he arrived at 11:55 a.m. Duffer was asleep and did not answer Slicker's doorbell rings until 12:15 p.m. Duffer than rejected Slicker's bike on the ground that he had already bought Koolcat's. In a lawsuit by Slicker against Duffer for breach of contract, what would the court probably decide regarding Slicker's letter of October 9?
489	A state law required all automobile drivers to carry liability insurance; however, because of the high number of auto accidents in the state, the cost of insurance became prohibitive. A study sponsored by the state legislature showed that males under the age of 21 were four times more likely to get into automobile accidents than any other group, including females in the same age group. The study predicted that prohibiting males under the age of 21 from driving would result in a 15% reduction in all other persons' automobile insurance rates. Ultimately, the legislature raised the minimum age for obtaining a driver's license to age 21 for males. Females were still allowed to obtain licenses at age 16. An 18-year-old male living in the state when the limit was raised, and who worked as a pizza delivery driver, was fired from his job and replaced by a 17-year-old female. If the young man sues to have the law set aside and prevails, it will most likely be because the state could not prove that the law was:
490	To discourage the consumption of alcohol, a city adopted an ordinance prohibiting any advertisements of liquor prices except within the stores in which alcoholic beverages are sold. After the ordinance was adopted, a store located within the city that had regularly advertised its liquor prices experienced a 30% decrease in sales. The owner was not given personal notice of the city council meeting at which the ordinance was adopted. If he had been, as the owner of the city's largest volume dealer of alcoholic beverages, he would have spoken against the adoption of the ordinance. If the store owner brings suit to have the ordinance declared unconstitutional, how should the court rule?
491	In the plaintiff's antitrust suit against the defendant manufacturers of insulation, the plaintiff's interrogatories asked for information concerning total sales of insulation by each of the defendants in a particular year. The defendants replied to the interrogatories by referring the plaintiff to an insulation manufacturer's journal for the information. If, at trial, the plaintiff offers the journal as evidence of the sales volume, this evidence is:
492	Pace sues Def Company for injuries suffered when Pace's car collided with Def Company's truck. Def's general manager prepared a report of the accident at the request of the company's attorney in preparation for the trial, and delivered the report to the attorney. Pace demands that the report be produced. Will production of the report be required?
493	Rogers gave Mitchell a power of attorney containing the following provision: "My attorney. Mitchell, is specifically authorized to sell and convey any part or all of my real property.' Mitchell conveyed part of Rogers' land to Stone by deed in the customary form containing convenants of title. Stone sues Rogers for breach of a covenant. The outcome of Stone's suit will be governed by whether
494	A homeowner lived next door to a vacant lot owned by another neighbor. From the time the homeowner purchased his own property, he told other people that he owned the vacant lot. The homeowner had an underground dog fence installed under the vacant lot without the neighbor's knowledge. The homeowner also mowed the vacant lot regularly in the summer. When he had landscaping services performed on his own property, the landscapers dug up vegetation beds, which extended three feet into the neighbor's lot. After the statutory period for bringing a trespass action had passed, the homeowner brought an action to quiet title, claiming ownership of the vacant lot. Which of the following additional facts, if true, would be most helpful to the homeowner's case?
495	A woman owned a tract of land. The jurisdiction in which the land was located had a statute providing that no conveyance or mortgage of an interest in land is valid against a subsequent purchaser for value without notice thereof whose conveyance is first recorded. The following events occurred: December 2007: The woman owed money to a man, and in satisfaction of this debt, the woman conveyed the property to him. Although the man intended to have the deed recorded, he mistakenly failed to do so. August 2008: The woman borrowed money from a bank and, to secure the loan, executed a mortgage deed on the property. The bank promptly recorded this mortgage. December 2008: The man discovered that the deed from the woman's property was still in his safe and had not yet been recorded. He immediately went and recorded it. In February 2009, the woman defaulted on her loan, and the bank therefore instituted proceedings to foreclose on the property. The bank will:
496	Dann, who was charged with the crime of assaulting Smith, admitted striking Smith but claimed to have acted in self-defense when he was attacked by Smith, who was drunk and belligerent after a football game. Dann's friend Frank was called to testify that Smith had a reputation among the people with whom he lived and worked for lawbreaking and frequently engaging in brawls. The trial judge should rule the testimony
497	Olivia owned Blackacre, her home. Her daughter, Dawn, lived with her and always referred to Blackacre as "my property." Two years ago, Dawn, for a valuable consideration, executed and delivered to Bruce an instrument in the proper form of a warranty deed purporting to convey Blackacre to Bruce in fee simple, reserving to herself an estate for two years in Blackacre. Bruce promptly and properly recorded his deed. One year ago, Olivia died and by will, duly admitted to probate, left her entire estate to Dawn. One month ago, Dawn, for a valuable consideration, executed and delivered to Carl an instrument in the proper form of a warranty deed purporting to convey Blackacre to Carl, who promptly and properly recorded the deed. Dawn was then in possession of Blackacre and Carl had no actual knowledge of the deed to Bruce. Immediately thereafter, Dawn gave possession to Carl. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides: "No conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value and without notice unless the same be recorded according to law." Last week, Dawn fled the jurisdiction. Upon learning the facts, Carl brought an appropriate action against Bruce to quiet title to Blackacre. If Carl wins, it will be because
498	A federal statute imposed criminal penalties for killing certain specified animals that have been determined by Congress to be of importance to the tourism industry in the region in which the animal was located. Among the animals protected was the red fox. However, a state in which the red fox was located classified the animal as a varmint that could be destroyed at will by anyone with a general hunting license. A rancher who possessed a valid state general hunting license regularly shot and killed red foxes that ate his artichoke plants. If the rancher is prosecuted under the federal statute and challenges the constitutionality of the law, which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument in support of the federal statute?
499	As part of a deal to raise the federal debt limit, Congress passed a statute by a greater than two-thirds vote in both houses giving the President authority to cancel particular spending provisions that are contained within legislation that he signs into law. The statute provided that Congress could override the President's decisions only by a three-fourths vote. As soon as the statute went into effect, a Senator who had voted against the statute filed suit in federal district court, challenging its constitutionality. Is the Senator likely to succeed in her lawsuit?
500	A state enacted legislation providing for the testing of all high school students in the performance of certain adult-world tasks. In public schools, the test was administered at the school by government employees. In private schoolsboth religious and secular-the test was administered by school personnel, and the schools were reimbursed for the costs of administering the tests and reporting the results to the state. An association with appropriate standing filed suit seeking to enjoin the reimbursement to the religious schools, claiming that the reimbursement violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The trial court should:
501	A defendant is charged with beating a victim to death with a set of brass knuckles during the course of a fight in a tavern. The victim was found to have a pistol on his person at the time of the fight. During the course of the trial, the defendant took the stand in his own defense and testified that the victim threatened him with a gun and the defendant had hit the victim with the brass knuckles in self-defense. To rebut the defendant's claim, the prosecution wishes to place the bartender on the stand, who will testify that two years prior to the attack on the victim, she had seen the defendant approach a customer in her tavern from behind, put on a pair of brass knuckles, and strike the customer a severe blow on the side of the face with a brass-knuckled fist. The prosecutor, in accordance with local court rules, has apprised the defense attorney of the general tenor of the bartender's proposed testimony. As soon as the bartender is sworn in, the defense attorney raises an objection. The court should rule that the bartender's testimony is:
502	A homeowner purchased a new electric garage door opener directly from the manufacturer. A representative of the manufacturer installed the opener and tested it after installation. The opener had a safety sensor that was supposed to detect when anything was in the path of the door and automatically stop and retract. One day as the homeowner was backing out of her garage, she accidently hit the garage door button too early, causing the garage door to come down and crush the hood of her car. The homeowner brought a negligence action against the manufacturer to recover her damages. Evidence at trial showed that the manufacturer had tested a sample of the garage door openers in the same series as the one installed in the homeowner's garage, and had conducted its normal tests with regard to the installation. The particular opener installed in the homeowner's garage, however, had a defective circuit that disabled the safety sensor. To establish a prima facie case, the homeowner must show that:
503	On August 1, Geriatrics, Inc., operating a "lifetime care" home for the elderly, admitted Ohlster, who was 84 years old, for a trial period of two months. On September 25, Ohlster and Geriatrics entered into a written lifetime care contract with an effective commencement date of October 1. The full contract price was $20,000, which, as required by the terms of the contract, Ohlster prepaid to Geriatrics on September 25. Ohlster died of a heart attack on October 2. In a restitutionary action, can the administratrix of Ohlster's estate, a surviving sister, recover on behalf of the estate either all or part of the $20,000 paid to Geriatrics on September 25?
504	Police inadvertently went to the suspect's house when they were executing a search warrant for drugs that had been issued for a different address. Despite the suspect's protests, the police forcibly entered his home and discovered a notebook lying on top of the desk in the suspect's study. The notebook listed several prominent lobbyists with dates and amounts of money next to their names. The district attorney intends to ask the grand jury to indict the suspect on charges of soliciting and receiving bribes. A prominent politician who was formerly an associate of the suspect will testify that the suspect is widely regarded in the political community as being willing totdo anything, legal or not, if the price is right. A constitutional attack on an indictment against the suspect would probably:
505	A member of an out-of-town yacht club agreed to buy a luxury boat from a local yachtsman, a boat which the parties referred to as "the 'Lady' boat" throughout their preliminary negotiations. The yachtsman owned two boats-"Lady Be Good" and "Lady Luck." The yachtsman's intent was to sell "Lady Luck," while the club member intended to buy "Lady Be Good," which the club member knew was once owned by the club member's favorite celebrity. The club member was unaware of the existence of "Lady Luck." The written contract for the yachtsman's "Lady" boat included a sale price of $100,000. When the yachtsman delivered "Lady Luck" to the club member's slip, the club member saw that it was not the boat he had intended to purchase and refused to accept delivery. If the club member sues the yachtsman for specific performance to compel him to deliver "Lady Be Good," and the yachtsman countersues to compel the club member to accept delivery of "Lady Luck," who should prevail?
506	Linda was fifteen years old, but she appeared and acted older. When asked, she always said she was twenty-two, and she carried false identification saying she was that old. She frequented taverns and drank heavily. One evening in a bar she became acquainted with Duke. He believed her when she told him her claimed age. They had several drinks and became inebriated. Later, they drove in Duke's car to a secluded spot. After they had necked for a while, Duke propositioned Linda and she consented. Before Duke achieved penetration, Linda changed her mind, saying, "Stop! Don't touch me! I don't want to do it." When Duke did not desist, Linda started to cry and said, "I am only fifteen." Duke immediately jumped from the car and ran away. Duke was indicted for attempted rape, assault with intent to rape, contributing to the delinquency of a minor, and attempted statutory rape. The age of consent in the jurisdiction is sixteen. The attempted rape charge can only be sustained if
507	Poe ordered some merchandise from Store. When the merchandise was delivered, Poe decided that it was not what he had ordered, and he returned it for credit. Store refused to credit Poe's account, continued to bill him, and, after 90 days, turned the account over to Kane, a bill collector, for collection. Kane called at Poe's house at 7 p.m. on a summer evening while many of Poe's neighbors were seated on their porches. When Poe opened the door, Kane, who was standing just outside the door, raised an electrically amplified bullhorn to his mouth. In a voice that could be heard a block away, Kane called Poe a "deadbeat" and asked him when he intended to pay his bill to Store. Poe, greatly angered, slammed the door shut. The door struck the bullhorn and jammed it forcibly against Kane's face. As a consequence, Kane lost his front teeth. If Poe asserts a claim based on defamation against Kane, will Poe prevail?
508	The defendant is charged with the burglary of a home. Evidence presented at the defendant's trial indicates that he talked another person into assisting him. The jury is instructed on burglary, solicitation, conspiracy, and attempt. If the defendant is found by the jury to be guilty of burglary:
509	A developer subdivided a 25-acre tract of land into 100 quarter-acre lots. On each lot she built a two-unit townhouse. The deeds to each of the purchasers contained a covenant that "the grantee, his heirs and assigns" would use the property only for single-family use. All deeds were promptly and properly recorded. Subsequently, the zoning laws were amended to allow multifamily use within the subdivision. Six months later, a social worker offered to purchase an original owner's unit that was for sale. The social worker informed the owner that she planned to operate a halfway house out of the unit, an activity in conformity with the applicable zoning regulations. Therefore, the owner did not include the single-family restriction in the deed to the social worker. If a neighbor, who purchased his lot from the developer, seeks to enjoin the operation of the halfway house, will he succeed?
510	An indictment was filed in federal district court charging the defendant with violations of federal bank robbery statutes. At trial, the government attempted to introduce into evidence the testimony of the defendant's wife, who would testify that she had seen the defendant arm himself on several occasions with weapons identical to those used in the bank robberies, had seen him return to their home carrying sacks filled with money with the markings of the robbed banks, and had overheard, while serving meals, the defendant and his co-defendants discussing plans for robbing the various banks and concealing the loot. The defendant's attorney objected, and the district court judge ruled that the wife's testimony was within the spousal privilege and could not be admitted over the defendant's objection. Was this ruling correct?
511	Which of the following will the court not take judicial notice of?
512	The bus in which Pat was riding was struck from the rear by a taxi. He sued Cab Company for a claimed neck injury. Cab Company claimed the impact was too slight to have caused the claimed injury and introduced testimony that all passengers had refused medical attention at the time of the accident. Pat called a doctor from City Hospital to testify that three persons (otherwise proved to have been on the bus) were admitted to the hospital for treatment of severe neck pain within a week after the accident. The trial judge should rule the doctor's testimony
513	Shortly before their wedding, a man and a woman bought a tract of land, taking title in both names. They had intended to build a summer cottage there, but many years after their marriage the land was still a vacant lot. The man decided that their introverted son would have more confidence if he were a landowner; thus, the man drew up a deed conveying a one-quarter interest in the land to him. Not wanting to show favoritism, two weeks later the man drew up a deed conveying a one-quarter interest in the same land to their daughter. Who owns the land?
514	A proprietor of a business in a small town who had a very antagonistic relationship with the mayor was denied a renewal of his business license. At a village council meeting that was closed to the public, the proprietor engaged in a heated argument with the mayor and demanded to know why his business license had not been renewed. The mayor truthfully declared that it was due to reports that the business was conducting illegal gambling on the premises. The mayor had received such reports but had not yet had them investigated. Council members at the meeting later voted to overturn the mayor's decision and renew the license. After a subsequent investigation, the reports were determined to be false. In a defamation action by the proprietor against the mayor, the proprietor will:
515	An investor rented his property to a pottery maker, who intended to use the back part of the building for living quarters, and the front part as a pottery studio. The pottery maker installed a kiln, some lights, and some storage units in the front part of the building for her use. Sometime later, the investor mortgaged the property to a bank to secure a loan. The mortgage was recorded, but the investor did not personally tell the pottery maker that he had done so. In fact, she only learned of it when the investor defaulted on the loan and the bank foreclosed on the mortgage and told the pottery maker that she would have to quit the premises. The pottery maker began removing the equipment and fixtures that she had installed in the building. The bank objected and sought an injunction to prevent her from doing so. Under these circumstances, the court should deny the bank the injunction because:
516	On April 15, a seller entered into a valid written agreement to sell her home to a buyer for $175,000. The provisions of the agreement provided that closing would be at the buyer's attorney's office on May 15, and that the seller would deliver to the buyer marketable title, free and clear of all encumbrances. On the date of closing, the seller offered to the buyer the deed to the house, but the buyer refused to go ahead with the purchase because his attorney told him that a contractor who had done work on the house had recorded a lis pendens on May 1 against the property regarding a $10,000 contract dispute he had with the seller. The seller indicated that she was unaware of the lien, but that she was willing to go ahead with the sale and set aside funds from the purchase price to cover the contractor's claim until the dispute was resolved. The buyer still refused to proceed, stating that the seller had breached the contract. If the seller brings an action against the buyer for specific performance, the probable result will be:
517	A widget manufacturer sent out a circular describing its various models of widgets, specifying that "Model Z16" widgets were $3,500 per 100 widget lot "C.I.F." A recipient of the circular faxed an order for "two 100 widget lots, Model Z16, at $3,500 per lot per your circular, with delivery by August 6." The manufacturer mailed back its standard confirmation form, confirming quantity, price, and delivery date. However, the purchasing agent for the company that placed the order noticed that a rubber stamp impression in red ink had been placed on the bottom of the manufacturer's confirmation, stating that acceptance of the order was conditioned on a crating charge of $150 per 100 widget lot. Assuming no additional facts, which of the following best represents the relationship between the manufacturer and the company that placed the order, immediately after the company received the manufacturer's confirmation?
518	An investor financed the purchase of a lot through a mortgage on the property held by a bank. The mortgage contained a "due-on-sale clause," requiring the mortgagor to pay off the mortgage when the property is sold. The investor made all of his mortgage payments in a timely manner. Five years later, he sold the property to a buyer. The investor told the buyer that there was a mortgage on the property but he did not mention the due-on-sale clause. The buyer paid the investor the asking price for the property. The investor pocketed the proceeds without paying off the bank mortgage. Which of the following best states the effect of the due-on-sale clause on the buyer's interest in the property?
519	A landowner owned two adjoining parcels of land, a ranch and a farm. She contracted to sell the ranch to her brother, who promptly and properly recorded the deed. Because the ranch had no direct access to a public road, the landowner wrote into the deed, "my brother, his heirs and assigns shall have the right to use the existing dirt path along the eastern border of the farm for ingress and egress to the ranch." A few years later, the landowner sold the farm to a developer, who decided to subdivide the farm into lots for single-family residences. Because no street in the proposed subdivision would align with the dirt path mentioned in the deed from the landowner to the brother, the brother would be without ingress and/or egress to his land. The brother instituted an appropriate action to enjoin the blocking of the dirt path. The most likely result is that judgment will be for:
520	A defendant visited her doctor to seek treatment for a bullet wound. While he was treating the wound, the doctor asked the defendant how she was shot. The defendant replied that she was struck by a police officer's bullet while running away from a jewelry store she had robbed, but she implored the doctor not to tell this to anyone. The doctor promised that he would not. Although the defendant was never charged by the police, the owner of the jewelry store brought suit against her seeking the value of the stolen goods. The defendant denied robbing the store. At the trial, the owner calls the doctor to testify to the statement made to him by the defendant. The defense attorney objects on the ground that such testimony is barred by the jurisdiction's physician-patient privilege. The objection should be:
521	A farmer orally agreed to lease a tractor from a company for $500. However, when the company's secretary put the agreement into writing she accidentally typed in a charge of $300. Both the company and the farmer signed the contract without noticing the mistake in the price. When it came time for payment, the farmer refused to pay more than $300 for the rental of the tractor. If the company brings an action for the difference between the payment as orally agreed and as memorialized in the contract, which of the following, if proven, would most benefit the company?
522	On a wholly random basis, a state agency has given a few probationary employees who were not rehired at the end of their probationary period a statement of reasons and an opportunity for a hearing; but the agency has very rarely done so. No statute or rule of the agency required such a statement of reasons or a hearing. The employment of Masters, a probationary employee, was terminated without a statement of reasons or an opportunity for a hearing. The agency did not even consider whether it should give him either. A suit by Masters requesting a statement of reasons and a hearing will probably be
523	Landholder was land-rich by inheritance but money-poor, having suffered severe losses on bad investments, but still owned several thousand acres of unencumbered timberland. He had a large family, and his normal, fixed personal expenses were high. Pressed for cash, he advertised a proposed sale of standing timber on a choice 2,000-acre tract. The only response was an offer by Logger, the owner of a large, integrated construction enterprise, after inspection of the advertised tract. For this question only, assume the following facts. Logger offered to buy, sever, and remove the standing timber from the advertised tract at a cash price 70% lower than the regionally prevailing price for comparable timber rights. Landholder, by then in desperate financial straits and knowing little about timber values, signed and delivered to Logger a letter accepting the offer. If, before Logger commences performance, Landholder's investment fortunes suddenly improve and he wishes to get out of the timber deal with Logger, which of the following legal concepts affords his best prospect of effective cancellation?
524	A car owner purchased four new tires from a tire shop. The tires were manufactured by a reputable tire manufacturer. It was widely known in the tire industry that purchasers of tires would, on occasion, exceed posted speed limits, and therefore the tires were designed to perform at speeds higher than the maximum speed of 65 m.p.h. allowable in most states. The car owner then sold her car to a friend. The friend immediately took the car on a 500-mile trip. During the course of the journey, the friend often drove his car 10 m.p.h. over the posted limit of 65 m.p.h. As the friend approached his destination, he was driving 73 m.p.h. on smooth pavement. Suddenly his left front tire blew out because of a hidden defect in the tire. The car went out of control, crashed into another vehicle, and the friend was severely injured. If the friend sues the tire store for his injuries in a jurisdiction that does not apply its comparative negligence rules to strict liability actions, the friend should:
525	Passenger is suing Defendant for injuries suffered in the crash of a small airplane, alleging that Defendant had owned the plane and negligently failed to have it properly maintained. Defendant has asserted in defense that he never owned the plane or had any responsibility to maintain it. At trial, Passenger calls Witness to testify that Witness had sold to Defendant a liability insurance policy on the plane. The testimony of Witness is
526	A state enacted a gross receipts tax on all businesses operating in that state. The tax was a proportional tax based on revenue derived by businesses in the state. A leading manufacturer of widget assembly devices had its corporate headquarters and most of its manufacturing plants in the state. Its products were sold to widget users throughout the country. If the company challenges the constitutionality of the state's assessment of the tax against it, what is its strongest argument?
527	Art, who owned Blackacre in fee simple, conveyed Blackacre to Bea by warranty deed. Celia, an adjoining owner, asserted title to Blackacre and brought an appropriate action against Bea to quiet title to Blackacre. Bea demanded that Art defend Bea's title under the deed's covenant of warranty, but Art refused. Bea then successfully defended at her own expense. Bea brought an appropriate action against Art to recover Bea's expenses incurred in defending against Celia's action to quiet title to Blackacre. In this action, the court should decide for
528	Alex and Brenda owned in fee simple Greenacre as tenants in common, each owning an undivided one-half interest. Alex and Brenda joined in mortgaging Greenacre to Marge by a properly recorded mortgage that contained a general warranty clause. Alex became disenchanted with land-owning and notified Brenda that he would no longer contribute to the payment of installments due Marge. After the mortgage was in default and Marge made demand for payment of the entire amount of principal and interest due, Brenda tendered to Marge, and Marge deposited, a check for one-half of the amount due Marge. Brenda then demanded a release of Brenda's undivided one-half interest. Marge refused to release any interest in Greenacre. Brenda promptly brought an action against Marge to quiet title to an undivided one-half interest in Greenacre. In such action, Brenda should
529	A wife was suspected of killing her husband, although she told the police that he was struck by a bullet shot through the window of their home. The wife agreed to undergo a polygraph examination. An experienced polygraph analyst told the police that the wife was telling the truth when she asserted that she had nothing to do with the husband's death. Two weeks later, the police arrested the husband's former business partner. During the partner's trial, the prosecution called the wife to the stand to testify to the happenings on the night the husband was slain and to the "bad blood" that existed between the partner and the husband. The defense attorney, without objection by the prosecutor, asked the wife questions regarding her stormy marital relationship with the husband in an attempt to show that the wife and not his client might have been the slayer. Having seen one of her key witnesses' testimony weakened, the prosecutor on redirect asked the wife, "After your husband was killed, didn't the police have you take a lie detector test?" As soon as the question was asked, the defense attorney objected. The objection is likely to be:
530	In a written contract Singer agreed to deliver to Byer 500 described chairs at $20 each F.O.B. Singer's place of business. The contract provided that "neither party will assign this contract without the written consent of the other." Singer placed the chairs on board a carrier on January 30. On February 1 Singer said in a signed writing, "I hereby assign to Wheeler all my rights under the Singer-Byer contract." Singer did not request and did not get Byer's consent to this transaction. On February 2 the chairs while in transit were destroyed in a derailment of the carrier's railroad car. In an action by Wheeler against Byer, Wheeler probably will recover
531	A plaintiff sues a defendant for breach of contract. The existence and terms of the contract are in dispute. The plaintiff's lawyer calls the plaintiff to the witness stand and seeks to elicit testimony that the plaintiff and the defendant met on a certain date and reached an agreement, which was reduced to a writing. The plaintiff then intends to testify: "The writing, which was subsequently inadvertently destroyed, provided that the defendant would purchase 300 widgets from me at a price of $1,000." The quoted testimony is admissible only if:
532	An owner and a builder executed a contract providing that the builder was to construct a residence on a specified lot according to plans and specifications. The total contract price was $800,000. No date was included in the contract for completion of the home. After the builder completed 60% of the residence, a flash flood from a nearby river partially eroded the lot but left the construction undamaged. The builder determined that it would cost an additional $1.2 million to repair the lot so that the residence can be constructed according to the plans. Without the additional lot repair work, the residence cannot be constructed at all. Must the builder perform the contract?
533	A jurisdiction has the following decisional law on questions of principal and accomplice liability: CASE A: Defendant, a hardware store owner, sold several customers an item known as a "SuperTrucker," which detects police radar and enables speeders to avoid detection. When one of the devices broke down and the speeder was arrested, he confessed that he often sped, secure in the knowledge that his "SuperTrucker" would warn him of police radar in the vicinity. Held: Defendant guilty as an accomplice to speeding. CASE B: Defendant told Arnold that Defendant had stored some stereo equipment in a self-storage locker. He gave Arnold a key and asked Arnold to pick up the equipment and deliver it to Defendant's house. Arnold complied, and removed the equipment from the locker, using the key. In fact, the equipment belonged to Defendant's neighbor, whose locker key Defendant had found in the driveway. Held: Defendant guilty as an accomplice to burglary. CASE C: Tooley, a city council member, accepted a bribe from Defendant in exchange for his vote on Defendant's application for a zoning variance. A statute prohibits the taking of bribes by public officials. Held: Defendant not guilty as an accomplice to Tooley's violation of the bribery statute. CASE D: Defendant, an innkeeper, sometimes let his rooms to prostitutes, whom he knew to be using the rooms to ply their trade. He charged the prostitutes the same price as other guests at his inn. Held: Defendant not guilty as an accomplice to prostitution.' Larson, a plastic surgeon, agreed to remove the fingerprints from the hands of "Fingers" Malloy, whom Larson knew to be a safecracker. Larson charged his usual hourly rate for the operation. Afterward, Malloy burglarized a bank safe and was convicted of burglary. Charged with burglary, Larson should be
534	A liquor store clerk was working the counter when a young girl came up with a bottle of wine to purchase. The clerk thought that she looked too young to buy wine, so he asked her for her driver's license. The young girl reached into her purse as if to get her license. As the clerk reached under the counter to get a bag, the girl grabbed the bottle of wine, threw $10 on the counter, and ran out. In this state, it is a misdemeanor to sell wine or liquor to a person under the age of 21. If the clerk is prosecuted for violation of this statute, his best defense is that:
535	The High National Grasslands is owned by the United States and is located in the center of a large western state. Acting pursuant to a federal statute authorizing such action, the United States Bureau of Land Management leased the grazing rights in the High National Grasslands to ranchers located nearby. Grazingland Company owns a vast amount of rangeland adjacent to the High National Grasslands and leases its land for livestock grazing purposes to the same ranchers, but at prices higher than those charged by the Bureau. Grazingland Company sued the Bureau in an appropriate federal district court to restrain the Bureau from competing with that company by leasing the High National Grasslands. Which of the following constitutional provisions may most easily and directly be used to justify the federal statute authorizing this leasing program of the Bureau of Land Management?
536	For valuable consideration, the owner of a parcel of land signed and gave to her neighbor a duly executed instrument, which provided that the owner retained the right to sell the property during her lifetime, but at her death, or if she earlier decided to sell, the property would be offered to her neighbor at $500 per acre. The neighbor had to exercise this right, if at all, within 60 days of receipt of said offer to sell. The neighbor recorded the instrument. The instrument was not valid as a will. Is the neighbor's right under the instrument valid?
537	Susie Blake, a working woman, always brought her lunch to eat in the office. One Saturday afternoon she went to Roger's Market, a local self-service grocery, and bought a can of corned beef. The can had printed on its label "A Product of West Beef Company." The company was a reputable supplier of beef products. On Sunday evening, Susie prepared a sandwich for lunch for the next day, using the can of corned beef she had bought on Saturday. When Susie bit into her sandwich at lunch time the next day, a large sliver of bone concealed in the corned beef slice pierced between her teeth, broke one off, and came to rest deep in the roof of her mouth. This accident caused her to suffer severe pain and to incur medical expenses of $700. Susie brought two claims for damages: one against Roger's Market and the other against West Beef Company. The claims were tried together. At the trial, Susie proved all of the above facts leading up to her injury as well as the elements of her damage. West Beef Company, one of the defendants, proved that it had not processed and packed the corned beef, but that such had been done by its regular and independent supplier, Meat Packers, Inc. West Beef Company further proved that it had never obtained from Meat Packers, Inc. defective meat products, and that it had no way of knowing that the can contained any dangerous material. Roger's Market, the other defendant, proved that it had no way of knowing the content of the can was likely to cause harm, and that it had sold the products of West Beef Company for a number of yearshwithout ever having been told by a customer that the products were defective. Both defendants agreed by stipulation in open court that Meat Packers, Inc. had been guilty of negligence in packing the corned beef containing the sliver of bone. If Susie's claim against Roger's Market is based on a negligence theory, Susie will
538	A man and a woman who were not married each put up 50% of the down payment on a home. They took title as tenants in common, and each orally promised the other that the survivor should take title to the home. They lived in the home for three years, equitably dividing mortgage payments and maintenance expenses. They were then involved in a serious car accident. The woman was killed almost instantly and the man died in the hospital one week later. Neither left a will. The woman was survived only by her mother. The man was survived only by his brother. Who owns the home?
539	Two police officers in uniform were on foot patrol in a neighborhood frequented by drug sellers. They saw Sandra, who, when she saw them, turned around and started to walk quickly away. The police ran after her and shouted, "Stop and don't take another step, lady!" Sandra turned, looked at the police, and stopped. She put her arms up in the air. As the police approached, she threw a small object into nearby bushes. The police retrieved the object, which turned out to be a small bag of cocaine, and then arrested Sandra. Sandra is charged with possession of the cocaine. She moves pretrial to suppress its use as evidence on the ground that it was obtained as the result of an illegal search and seizure. Her motion should be
540	The police set up a sting operation targeting a resale shop that had a reputation for selling stolen goods. An undercover police officer approached the owner of the shop posing as a truck driver who was down on his luck and looking for a way to earn some extra money. The shop owner suggested that on his next load the officer should take a box of goods from the back of his truck, bring them to the shop owner to sell in exchange for cash, and then report the box lost to the trucking company. The next day the officer gave the shop owner an empty box in exchange for money. Immediately after the exchange, the shop owner was arrested. Which of the following crimes did the owner commit?
541	A tanker truck driver delivering gasoline to filling stations parked on the street in front of a building to get a cup of coffee after his deliveries. Contrary to company regulations, he parked in an area clearly marked as a no parking zone. Just as the driver went across the street, a minor quake jolted the area and caused a collapse of the walls of the building, which was extremely run-down and unstable. The front wall fell on top of the truck, causing gasoline to leak from the truck and stream down the street. A pedestrian walking two blocks away lit a cigarette and tossed a match in the street, causing the gasoline to ignite. The flames spread to a nearby commercial building and an explosion occurred, causing many windows in a neighboring apartment building to be blown inward. Flying glass was propelled into a tenant's apartment. The tenant suffered multiple cuts and a serious eye injury from the flying glass. The tenant brought a negligence action against the tanker company that employed the driver. If the court finds in favor of the tanker company it will be because:
542	A patient went to a highly reputable dentist, who honestly told her that she needed a lot of dental work, some of it involving complex procedures. When she asked the dentist what the cost would be, he told her "about $3,500." The patient agreed to use him as her dentist and he began her treatment. When the patient's treatment was finished, the dentist sent her a bill for $4,100, explaining that the higher bill was because more expensive inlays were used, and that he carefully documented the cost of his materials and had sound medical reasons for his decision. The patient honestly believed that it was unfair for the dentist to charge her $4,100. Therefore, she sent the dentist's invoice back to him, along with a check for $3,500. On the check the patient had clearly written "Payment In Full." The dentist read the notation on the check and deposited it at his bank. The dentist made no notation of his own on the check other than his signature on the back as an indorsement. Two weeks later the dentist called his bank to make sure that the patient's check had cleared. He then immediately filed suit against the patient for $600. Will the court award the dentist $600?
543	Bill owned in fee simple Lot 1 in a properly approved subdivision, designed and zoned for industrial use. Gail owned the adjoining Lot 2 in the same subdivision. The plat of the subdivision was recorded as authorized by statute. Twelve years ago, Bill erected an industrial building wholly situated on Lot 1 but with one wall along the boundary common with Lot 2. The construction was done as authorized by a building permit, validly obtained under applicable statutes, ordinances, and regulations. Further, the construction was regularly inspected and passed as being in compliance with all building code requirements. Lot 2 remained vacant until six months ago, when Gail began excavation pursuant to a building permit authorizing the erection of an industrial building situated on Lot 2 but with one wall along the boundary common with Lot 1. The excavation caused subsidence of a portion of Lot 1 that resulted in injury to Bill's building. The excavation was not done negligently or with any malicious intent to injure. In the jurisdiction, the time to acquire title by adverse possession or rights by prescription is 10 years. Bill brought an appropriate action against Gail to recover damages resulting from the injuries to the building on Lot 1. In such lawsuit, judgment should be for
544	In a writing signed by both parties, a renowned architect agreed to design and supervise construction of a new house for a buyer. The architect's fee was to be paid on completion of the house. When the design plans were about two-thirds complete, the architect assigned to a newly licensed architect "all of my rights and duties under my design and constructionsupervision contract with the buyer." The novice architect expressly promised the architect to carry out the work to the best of her ability. The buyer, on learning of the assignment, refused to allow the novice architect to proceed on the project and brought an action against the architect to compel him to resume and complete performance of the contract. Is the buyer entitled to such relief?
545	Mater, a wealthy widow, wishing to make a substantial and potentially enduring gift to her beloved adult stepson Prodigal, established with Vault Savings and Loan Association a passbook savings account by an initial deposit of $10,000. For this question only, assume the following facts. The passbook was issued solely in Prodigal's name; but Mater retained possession of it and Prodigal was not then informed of the savings account. Subsequently, Mater became disgusted with Prodigal's behavior and decided to give the same savings account solely to her beloved adult daughter Distaff. As permitted by the rules of Vault Savings and Loan, Mater effected this change by agreement with Vault. This time she left possession of the passbook with Vault. Shortly thereafter, Prodigal learned of the original savings account in his name and the subsequent switch to Distaffs name. If Prodigal now sues Vault Savings and Loan for $10,000 plus accrued interest, will the action succeed?
546	A landowner conveyed a parcel of land "to my brother, his heirs and assigns, but if my brother dies and is not survived by children by his present wife, then to my cousin and his heirs and assigns." Shortly after taking possession, the brother discovered rich metal deposits on the land, opened a mining operation, and removed and sold a considerable quantity of valuable ore without giving the cousin any notice of his action. The brother has no children. The brother, his wife, and the cousin are all still living. The cousin brought an action in equity for an accounting of the value of the ore removed and for an injunction against further removal. If the decision is for the brother, it will be because:
547	A brother and a sister inherited their childhood home from their father, taking title as tenants in common. The brother moved into the home, while the sister returned to her residence in a distant city. Although there was no discussion between the brother and the sister concerning their common ownership, the brother paid all taxes, insurance, and other carrying charges on the home. He paid no rent or other compensation to the sister, nor did the sister request any such payment. Thirty years later, a series of disputes arose between the brother and sister concerning their respective rights to the home. The jurisdiction where the land is located recognizes the usual common law types of co-tenancies, and has an ordinary 20-year adverse possession statute. If the brother brings an action against the sister to quiet title to the home in himself, the decision should be for:
548	The President of the United States and the leader of a bordering foreign nation agreed that each should appoint three members to a special joint commission to deal with a wildlife problem. The President of the United States, acting in concert with the foreign leader, named the joint commission as a permanent enforcement agency for the regulations that were adopted by both nations. Although the President received prior congressional authorization to enter into this agreement, the Senate did not ratify the agreement by a two-thirds vote. The President then entered into an executive agreement with the foreign leader whereby the joint commission was granted adjudicative as well as enforcement powers with respect to a particular issue. The executive agreement by the President is:
549	The Rapido is a sports car manufactured by the Rapido Motor Co. The Rapido has an excellent reputation for mechanical reliability with one exception, that the motor may stall if the engine has not had an extended warm-up. Driver had just begun to drive her Rapido in city traffic without a warm-up when the engine suddenly stalled. A car driven by Troody rear- ended Driver's car. Driver suffered no external physical injuries as a result of the collision. However, the shock of the crash caused her to suffer a severe heart attack. Driver brought an action against the Rapido Motor Co. based on strict liability in tort. During the trial, the plaintiff presented evidence of an alternative engine design of equal cost that would eliminate the stalling problem without impairing the functions of the engine in any way. The defendant moves for a directed verdict at the close of the evidence. This motion should be
550	Broker needed a certain rare coin to complete a set that he had contracted to assemble and sell to Collecta. On February 1, Broker obtained such a coin from Hoarda in exchange for $1,000 and Broker's signed, written promise to re-deliver to Hoarda "not later than December 31 this year" a comparable specimen of the same kind of coin without charge to Hoarda. On February 2, Broker consummated sale of the complete set to Collecta. On October 1, the market price of rare coins suddenly began a rapid, sustained rise; and on October 15 Hoarda wrote Broker for assurance that the latter would timely meet his coin-replacement commitment. Broker replied, "In view of the surprising market, it seems unfair that I should have to replace your coin within the next few weeks." For this question only, assume the following facts. After receiving Broker's message on October 17, Hoarda telephoned Broker, who said, "I absolutely will not replace your coin until the market drops far below its present level." Hoarda then sued Broker on November 15 for the market value of a comparable replacement-coin as promised by Broker in February. The trial began on December 1. If Broker moves to dismiss Hoarda's complaint, which of the following is Hoarda's best argument in opposing the motion?
551	A man from a foreign country obtained a doctorate in political science from a state university and applied to teach there. The man was denied employment at the university under a state law requiring all teachers within the state to be United States citizens. Is the state's citizenship requirement constitutional as it applies to the man?
552	Albert, the owner of a house and lot, leased the same to Barnes for a term of five years. In addition to the house, there was also an unattached, two-car brick garage located on the lot. Barnes earned his living as an employee in a local grocery store, but his hobby consisted of wood carving and the making of small furniture. Barnes installed a work bench, electric lights, and a radiator in the garage. He also laid pipes connecting the radiator with the heating plant inside the house. Thereafter Albert mortgaged the premises to Good Bank to secure a loan. Barnes was not given notice of the mortgage, but the mortgage was recorded. Still later, Albert defaulted on his mortgage payments, and Good Bank began foreclosure proceedings, as it was entitled to do under the terms of the mortgage. By this time Barnes's lease was almost ended. Barnes began the removal of the equipment he had installed in the garage. Good Bank brought an action to enjoin the removal of the equipment mentioned above. Both Barnes and Albert were named as defendants. If the equipment concerned had been installed by Albert, but the facts were otherwise unchanged, the effect on Good Bank's prayer for an injunction would be that the
553	Under the rule allowing exclusion of relevant evidence because its probative value is substantially outweighed by other considerations, which of the following is NOT to be considered?
554	A retail store ordered 100 women's swimsuits at $10 each, as advertised in the catalog of a swimwear manufacturer. The manufacturer shipped 40 swimsuits to the store, along with a letter stating in relevant part: "We have shipped you 40 swimsuits at $10 each in response to your recent order. Please remit $400. Be informed that limited inventory will prevent us from being able to ship any additional suits at this time or at any time during this year's beach season." The store took the 40 suits and began to sell them. The store immediately sought an alternate supplier of swimsuits. The best price it could obtain was $11 per suit from a different company. The store ordered, received, accepted, and paid for 60 suits at $11 each from the other company. The store has refused to pay the manufacturer the $400, and the manufacturer has sued for payment. The manufacturer is entitled to:
555	On November 1 the following notice was posted in a privately operated law school The faculty, seeking to encourage legal xesearch, offers to any student at this school who wins the current National Obscenity Law Competition the additional prize of $500. All competing papers must be submitted to the Dean's office before next May 1. (The National Competition is conducted by an outside agency, unconnected with any law school.) Student read this notice on November 2, and thereupon intensified his effort to make his paper on obscenity law, which he started in October, a winner. Student also left on a counter in the Dean's office a signed note saying, "I accept the faculty's $500 Obscenity Competition offer." This note was madvertently placed in Student's file and never reached the Dean or any faculty member personally. On the following April 1, the above notice was removed and the following substituted therefor: The faculty regrets that our offer regarding the National Obscenity Law Competition must be withdrawn. Student's paper was submitted through the Dean's office on April 15. On May 1, it was announced that Student had won the National Obscenity Law Competition and the prize of $1,000. The law faculty refused to pay anything. As to Student, was the offer effectively revoked?
556	The National AIDS Prevention and Control Act is a new, comprehensive federal statute that was enacted to deal with the public health crisis caused by the AIDS virus. Congress and the President were concerned that inconsistent lower court rulings with respect to the constitutionality, interpretation, and application of the statute might adversely affect or delay its enforcement and, thereby, jeopardize the public health. As a result, they included a provision in the statute providing that all legal challenges concerning those matters may be initiated only by filing suit directly in the United States Supreme Court. The provision authorizing direct review of the constitutionality, interpretation, or application of this statute only in the United States Supreme Court is
557	To increase tourism, a city began sponsoring laser light shows, which proved to be very popular. Several charitable organizations received permission from the council to sponsor a show and charge admission to raise money to help support their causes. One of them hired a famous laser light artist to give their show. When the artist arrived, he began setting up his lasers for the show. A city official soon stopped him, informing him that he could use only the city's lasers because the city feared that outsiders might use powerful lasers that could cause eye damage to viewers. The artist told the charitable organization that had hired him that the success of his art depends on the power of his lasers and that he could not produce desirable effects using the city's lasers. The charitable organization appealed to the city, but the city held fast to its rule requiring all laser light artists to use the city's lasers. If the charitable organization files an action against the city, the court will most likely:
558	For several weeks Mater, a wealthy, unemployed widow, and Nirvana Motors, Inc., negotiated unsuccessfully over the purchase price of a new Mark XX Rolls-Royce sedan, which, as Nirvana knew, Mater wanted her son Dilbert to have as a wedding gift. On April 27, Nirvana sent Mater a signed, dated memo saying, "If we can arrive at the same price within the next week, do we have a deal?" Mater wrote "Yes" and her signature at the bottom of this memo and delivered it back to Nirvana on April 29. On May 1, Mater wrote Nirvana a signed letter offering to buy "one new Mark XX Rolls-Royce sedan, with all available equipment, for $180,000 cash on delivery not later than June 1." By coincidence, Nirvana wrote Mater a signed letter on May 1 offering to sell her "one new Mark XX Rolls-Royce sedan, with all available equipment, for $180,000 cash on delivery not later than June 1." These letters crossed in the mails and were respectively received and read by Mater and Nirvana on May 2. For this question only, assume the following facts. On May 4, Mater and Nirvana Motors both signed a single document evidencing a contract for the sale by Nirvana to Mater, "as a wedding gift for Mater's son Dilbert," a new Mark XX Rolls-Royce sedan, under the same terms as previously stated in their correspondence. On May 5, Mater handed Dilbert a carbon copy of this document. In reliance on the prospective gift, Dilbert on May 20 sold his nearly new Cheetah (an expensive sports car) to a dealer at a "bargain" price of $50,000 and immediately informed Mater and Nirvana that he had done so. On May 25, however, Mater and Nirvana Motors by mutual agreement rescinded in a signed writing "any and all agreements heretofore made between the undersigned parties for the sale-and-purchase of a new Mark XX Rolls-Royce sedan." Later that day, Nirvana sold for $190,000 cash to another buyer the only new Mark XX Rolls-Royce that it had in stock or could readily obtain elsewhere. On June 1, Dilbert tendered $180,000 in cash to Nirvana Motors and demanded delivery to him "within a reasonable time" of a new Mark XX RollsRoyce sedan with all available equipment. Nirvana rejected the tender and denied any obligation. If Dilbert sues Nirvana for breach of contract, which of the following will the court probably decide?
559	A landowner conveyed a vacant tract of land to a developer by quitclaim deed. The developer did not record its deed. Prior to the start of construction, the developer abandoned the project and returned the deed to the landowner. The landowner then executed and delivered a general warranty deed conveying the land to a buyer. The buyer promptly and properly recorded his deed. Subsequently, the developer decided to proceed with its original development of the land it had purchased from the landowner. The jurisdiction has the following recording act: "A conveyance of an interest in land shall not be valid against any subsequent purchaser for value, without notice thereof, unless the conveyance is recorded." In a suit between the developer and the buyer, the buyer will prevail, if at all, because:
560	A driver drove into an intersection and struck a pedestrian. The driver immediately left his car and ran to the pedestrian. Before the ambulance arrived, the driver said to the pedestrian, "It was all my fault; I'm sorry I ran a red light." The driver then said, "I'll pay for all your medical expenses." The pedestrian sued the driver for his injuries and, at the resulting trial, the pedestrian wished to testify to the two statements made by the driver. The defense objected. The court should rule that:
561	Congress enacts a law providing that all disagreements between the United States and a state over federal grant-in-aid funds shall be settled by the filing of a suit in the federal district court in the affected state. "The judgment of that federal court shall be transmitted to the head of the federal agency dispensing such funds who, if satisfied that the judgment is fair and lawful, shall execute the judgment according to its terms." This law is
562	Owner owned Greenacre, a tract of land, in fee simple. Owner executed an instrument in the proper form of a deed, purporting to convey Greenacre to Purchaser in fee simple. The instrument recited that the conveyance was in consideration of "$5 cash in hand paid and for other good and valuable consideration." Owner handed the instrument to Purchaser and Purchaser promptly and properly recorded it. Two months later, Owner brought an appropriate action against Purchaser to cancel the instrument and to quiet title. In support, Owner proved that no money in fact had been paid by Purchaser, notwithstanding the recitation, and that no other consideration of any kind had been supplied by Purchaser. In such action, Owner should
563	A defendant was tearing up a stretch of pavement with a jackhammer when a rock flew up and struck a plaintiff in the head, causing him to be hospitalized. Because the jackhammer manufacturer had been out of business for several years, the plaintiff filed a lawsuit for his medical costs, lost work time, and pain and suffering solely against the defendant. At trial, the plaintiff's attorney calls a witness who testifies that, at the time of the incident, the defendant stated, "It was my fault." The defense attorney objects, but the judge overrules the objection on the ground that this is a declaration against interest. Are the grounds for the judge's decision correct?
564	A physics teacher at the local college was also a model rocket enthusiast. He owned a large parcel of land in the country, and on many occasions he would launch one of his rockets from the back area of his property. Although none of the teacher's rockets ever came near his neighbor's property, the neighbor complained to the teacher several times about his hobby and the fact that the teacher stored flammable fuels in his house. Once, his neighbor complained to the county sheriff, whereupon the teacher was charged with violating a local ordinance that prohibits the improper storage of flammable liquids on residential property. He was given a warning and told that he must have proper storage permits and facilities if he intended to keep the fuels for his model rockets on his property. Although the teacher obtained the proper permits to build underground storage tanks for his fuels, he continued to store them in 55-gallon drums in a shed located on the edge of his property farthest away from his neighbor. Eventually, his neighbor brought a suit based on public nuisance against the teacher, seeking an injunction against the teacher to prevent him from storing flammable liquids on his property and launching model rockets. The teacher's best defense is that:
565	The defendant was charged with reckless driving after his car hit a car driven by a priest. At trial, the passenger in the defendant's car at the time of the accident testified that the priest slammed on the brakes with no warning before the accident. The defendant was acquitted of the reckless driving charge. Subsequently, the priest sued the defendant for personal injuries and property damages. At the civil trial, counsel for the defendant asked the passenger, "Did the priest stop suddenly before the defendant hit him?" The passenger, who was angry with the defendant after an argument, responded, "I don't remember it that way. The priest may have slowed down a bit." The defense attorney seeks to introduce the transcript of the passenger's statement from the criminal trial. The priest's attorney objects. The transcript is:
566	A horse breeder offered to sell a colt to his neighbor and they agreed on a purchase price. The horse breeder subsequently received a letter from the neighbor thanking him for the sale and summarizing their agreement. The letter contained the neighbor's alleged signature. When the horse breeder attempted to set up transfer of the colt, the neighbor denied that she agreed to purchase it. In a breach of contract action against the neighbor, the horse breeder offers into evidence the letter. The horse breeder testifies that he is familiar with the neighbor's handwriting and recognizes the signature on the letter as being hers. Assuming appropriate objection by the neighbor, who claims that she did not sign the letter, the trial court should:
567	A friend knew that a man and a woman cared deeply for each other and encouraged the man to ask the woman to marry. Unbeknownst to the friend, the man was already married. Finally, after continued encouragement by the friend, the man went through a marriage ceremony with the woman, and the friend was the man's best man at the ceremony. If the friend is charged with being an accessory to bigamy, he should be found:
568	Professor James said to Mary Digit, president of the X-L Secretarial Service, "Since you folks have done good typing work for me in the past. I promise to bring you the manuscript for my new book." '-When?' asked Mary Digit. First chapter next Monday," replied the Professor. -Wouldn't that be nice," said Mary Digit. The following Monday James, foregoing the services of another secretarial service, brought chapter one to the X-L office but Mary Digit refused to take it saying they were all booked up for three weeks. Which of the following facts or inferences would be most helpful in an action by James against X-L?
569	The superintendent of a waste management company that operated a landfill noted that some children who lived in a nearby residential development had taken to sledding down the snow-covered mounds of dirt that were piled on the site. A construction company needing dirt fill for a highway project had offered to remove the mounds of dirt at minimal cost but the superintendent had not yet arranged for their removal. In the meantime he posted numerous signs around the landfill site that stated in bold letters, "NO TRESPASSING-NO SLEDDING." Despite the signs, which he saw and read, a 10-year-old neighborhood child sledded down one of the mounds of dirt and was propelled onto a busy highway adjacent to the landfill, where he was struck by a car and seriously injured. In a jurisdiction that retains traditional contributory negligence rules, is the waste management company liable for the child's injuries?
570	For this question only, assume the following facts. After making the contract with Bank, Computers discovered that the new technology it intended to use was unreliable and that no computer manufacturer could yet build a reliable computer using that technology. Computers thereupon notified Bank that it was impossible for Computers or anyone else to build the contracted-for computer "in the present state of the art." If Bank sues Computers for failure to perform its computer contract, the court will probably decide the case in favor of
571	A homeowner contracted with a local heating company to install two baseboard heaters in an addition to his home for a total cost of $3,500. This figure included the heaters and labor costs for installation. Upon completion of the installation, the heating company sent an invoice to the homeowner for the $3,500. The homeowner did not immediately pay the bill because the heaters were too noisy. The heating company sent a repair worker to the home to service the heaters, but after several attempts to fix the problem, the heaters were still too loud. The homeowner contacted a qualified repairman to find out how to fix the problem and was told it would cost an additional $300 for new blowers and $150 in labor costs to replace the faulty blowers. The homeowner mailed the heating company a copy of the repair estimate and a check for $3,050-the contract price less the cost of new blowers and labor to install them-and wrote prominently on the check "Payment in full for installation of two baseboard heaters." The heating company cashed the check upon receipt. The heating company then sued the homeowner for $450, the difference between the agreed contract price and the amount paid. Will the heating company be successful in recouping the $450 from the homeowner?
572	While negligently driving his father's uninsured automobile, 25-year-old Arthur crashed into an automobile driven by Betty. Both Arthur and Betty were injured. Charles, Arthur's father, erroneously believing that he was liable because he owned the automobile, said to Betty: "I will see to it that you are reimbursed for any losses you incur as a result of the accident." Charles also called Physician and told him to take care of Betty, and that he, Charles, would pay the bill. Arthur, having no assets, died as a result of his injuries. Dodge, one of Arthur's creditors, wrote to Charles stating that Arthur owed him a clothing bill of $200 and that he was going to file a claim against Arthur's estate. Charles replied: "If you don't file a claim against Arthur's estate, I will pay what he owed you." Which of the following, if true, would be significant in determining whether or not there was bargainedfor consideration to support Charles's promise to Physician? I. Physician had not begun treating Betty before Charles called him. II Charles had a contract with Betty.
573	Police investigating a homicide had probable cause to believe that the defendant had committed it. They then learned from a reliable informant that, a short while ago, the defendant had gone to a friend's house to obtain a false driver's license from the friend, a convicted forger. Believing that the defendant might still be there, the police, without obtaining a warrant, went to the friend's house. They entered the house and found the defendant hiding in the basement. He was arrested and given his Miranda warnings. At the police station, he confessed to the homicide. At a preliminary hearing, the defendant's attorney contends that the confession should be suppressed on Fourth Amendment grounds. Is the court likely to agree?
574	An ordinance of City makes it unlawful to park a motor vehicle on a City street within ten feet ofa fire hydrant. At 1:55 p.m. Parker, realizing he must be in Bank before it closed at 2:00 p.m., and finding no other space available, parked his automobile in front of a fire hydrant on a City street. Parker then hurried into the bank, leaving his aged neighbor, Ned, as a passenger in the rear seat of the car. About 5 minutes later, and while Parker was still in Bank, Driver was driving down the street. Driver swerved to avoid what he mistakenly thought was a hole in the street and sideswiped Parker's car. Parker's car was turned over on top of the hydrant, breaking the hydrant and causing a small flood of water. Parker's car was severely damaged and Ned was badly injured. There is no applicable guest statute. If Parker asserts a claim against Driver for damage to Parker's automobile, the most likely result is that Parker will
575	A recent nursing school graduate mailed a letter to a classmate on July 1 telling her that she was moving to take a nursing position in another city and asking her whether she wanted "the stuff in my house" for $2,500. The classmate received the letter on July 2, and on July 3 she sent the newly minted nurse a letter accepting the offer. The next day the classmate changed her mind, called the nurse, and told her to forget the deal. Later that same day, the nurse received the letter that her classmate had sent on July 3. Is there a contract between the nurse and her classmate?
576	A print cartridge company sent a letter to a business office offering to supply a free premium printer if the business office would agree to purchase all the print cartridges the office would need from the print cartridge company. This letter arrived in the hands of the business owner on the same day the office printer failed. The business office had experienced a slow month and the business owner was debating on whether to pay the office rent for the month or fix the printer. Based on the offer, the owner paid the rent. A week after she put the rent check in the mail, the owner received a second letter from the print cartridge company indicating that the printer program was being canceled due to a lack of printers. The next day, before she read the second letter, the owner mailed her acceptance letter to the print cartridge company. The print cartridge company refused to supply the business owner with a printer. If the business owner brings a breach of contract action against the print cartridge company, what result?
577	A boy was playing softball in a neighborhood park when a ball was hit over the fence and into a neighbor's yard. The boy knocked on the neighbor's door and obtained permission from her to retrieve the ball from her yard. As he bent to retrieve the ball in some bushes, the boy brushed against an exposed electric wire that was partially hidden by the bushes and received a severe electric shock and burns. The neighbor had failed to maintain the bushes, allowing them to become overgrown, and was not aware of the exposed wire. In a suit by the boy against the neighbor for these injuries:
578	An antique lover spotted a beautiful Early American bedroom ensemble at her favorite antique store. The ensemble included a bed, a mirror, and two dressers. Over a period of several weeks, the shop owner and the antique lover negotiated over a price, but they were unable to come to an agreement. On April 3, the shop owner and the antique lover signed a statement whereby the shop owner offered to sell to the antique lover an Early American bedroom ensemble, recorded as items 20465, 20466, 20467, and 20468 in the shop's registry, if the parties agree upon a price on or before April 12. On April 6, the shop owner sent a letter to the antique lover, telling her that she could have the bedroom ensemble for $22,000. Also on April 6, the antique lover sent a letter to the shop owner telling him that she was willing to pay him $22,000 for the bedroom ensemble. Both parties received their letters on April 7. Without assuming any additional facts, which of the following statements is most correct as of April 8?
579	A husband was arrested for domestic violence against his wife. His wife agreed to testify against him. Shortly after the jury had been sworn in, but before any evidence could be presented, the couple reconciled and the wife refused to testify. Believing that the case was not strong without the wife's testimony, the prosecution dropped the charges and the husband was released. A few weeks later, the couple split up again and the wife filed a battery action for damages against her husband based on the original incident. The husband has filed a motion asking the court to dismiss the wife's case on double jeopardy grounds. The court should:
580	Corp, a corporation, owned Blackacre in fee simple, as the real estate records showed. Corp entered into a valid written contract to convey Blackacre to Barbara, an individual. At closing, Barbara paid the price in full and received an instrument in the proper form of a deed, signed by duly authorized corporate officers on behalf of Corp, purporting to convey Blackacre to Barbara. Barbara did not then record the deed or take possession of Blackacre. Next, George (who had no knowledge of the contract or the deed) obtained a substantial money judgment against Corp. Then, Barbara recorded the deed from Corp. Thereafter, George properly filed the judgment against Corp. A statute of the jurisdiction provides: "Any judgment properly filed shall, for ten years from filing, be a lien on the real property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person against whom the judgment is rendered." Afterward, Barbara entered into a valid written contract to convey Blackacre to Polly. Polly objected to Barbara's title and refused to close. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides: "Unless the same be recorded according to law, no conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value and without notice." Barbara brought an appropriate action to require Polly to complete the purchase contract. The court should decide for]
581	Pate sued Dr. Doke for psychiatric malpractice and called Dr. Will as an expert witness. During Will's direct testimony, Will identified a text as a reliable authority in the field. He seeks to read to the jury passages from this book on which he had relied in forming his opinion on the proper standard of care. The passage is
582	To help stimulate the economy, Congress passed a law proscribing loans with interest rates higher than 10% per annum. A bank that had been lending money to high risk recipients had been charging 15% interest on its loans. If the bank challenges the federal statute, claiming that Congress had no power to pass such a statute, it will most likely:
583	The defendant was on trial for trying to sell a stolen antique ring to an antique dealer. The defendant claims that she had bought the ring from a street vendor earlier on the day of her arrest. The prosecution calls to the stand a woman who had given a party in her home which the defendant attended, and who had discovered later that evening that her antique ring was missing from her bedroom. She seeks to testify that her friend, who is now backpacking in another country, told her three days after the party that she had seen the defendant the previous evening in a restaurant wearing a ring that looked exactly like the woman's ring. The defense attorney objects. The objection should be:
584	An automobile, a truck, and a motorcycle were involved in a three vehicle accident. The automobile driver sued the trucker and the motorcyclist, each of whom countersued the driver and sued each other. At trial, it was determined by the trier of fact that the driver suffered $10,000 in damages, the trucker suffered $1,000 in damages, and the motorcyclist suffered $100,000 in damages. It was also determined that the driver was 45% at fault, the trucker was 35% at fault, and the motorcyclist was 20% at fault. How would damages be assessed in a jurisdiction that has adopted a modified or "partial" form of comparative negligence?
585	A bank was robbed by a short man (under 5'5") who was wearing a purple jumpsuit with a red hood and green gloves. The next day, the police received a tip from a neighbor of a short man that the man treated the entire apartment complex to breakfast and flashed a huge roll of bills. When questioned by police, the short man, no taller than 5'2", explained that a friend had paid off an old debt that the man had long ago written off. Later that day, sanitation workers found a purple jumpsuit and green gloves in the apartment complex's dumpster and called the police. The police arrested the short man and executed a search warrant for his apartment, which turned up nothing. At the short man's trial for bank robbery, the prosecution seeks to introduce into evidence the clothing recovered from the dumpster. The clothing is:
586	A threatening telephone call that purports to be from Defendant to Witness is most likely to be admitted against Defendant if
587	A landowner granted to his adjoining neighbor an easement in a driveway that crosses the southwest corner of the landowner's property. The easement was not recorded. A statute of the jurisdiction in which the landowner's and neighbor's properties are located provides: "No unrecorded interest in real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value without notice unless the conveyance is recorded." In which of the following cases has the neighbor's easement been terminated?
588	Two people agreed to steal a valuable painting that they knew was hanging in the victim's home. One would wait in the car with the engine running to ensure a quick getaway, while the other would break into the victim's home and steal the painting. The burglar broke into the home and reached the victim's library, where the painting was hanging. On the desk he noticed a large vial that appeared to contain cocaine. Thinking he could sell the cocaine and split the proceeds with the getaway driver, the burglar grabbed the vial and stuffed it in his pocket. He then took the painting off the wall and hurried back to the waiting car. The police arrived at that moment and apprehended the pair. A search incident to arrest turned up the vial of cocaine in the burglar's possession. If the getaway driver is charged with being an accomplice to the unlawful possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, she should be found:
589	A manufacturer that produces the most up-todate, high-speed mainframe computers on the market contracted with a company that is on the cutting edge of data storage technology for the sale/purchase of a "Yellow Giant" computer. The written contract stated that the company would purchase one of the manufacturer's "'Yellow Giant' computers at a price of $175,000." At the time, the going price for Yellow Giant computers was $150,000. When the manufacturer delivered a Yellow Giant on the specified date, the company refused to accept delivery and refused to pay. The manufacturer sued the company for breach, claiming that its expensive computers were manufactured to order and so it was forced to dispose of the Yellow Giant at a price far below fair market value. In defending the suit, the company's president wishes to testify that the company rejected the Yellow Giant because both parties knew that the company really wanted a "Purple Giant," a machine much faster than the Yellow Giant, but which the parties agreed would be called a "Yellow Giant" in the contract to keep competitors in the dark as to the company's new capabilities, and that the parties had executed contracts in the past that had specified a less powerful computer than the model that was actually delivered. Should the testimony of the company's president be admitted?
590	By way of a gift, Pat executed a deed naming his daughter, Marian, as grantee. The deed contained descriptions as follows: (1) All of my land and dwelling known as 44 Main Street, Midtown, United States, being one acre. (2) All that part of my farm, being a square with 200foot sides, the southeast corner of which is in the north line of my neighbor, Julia Brown. The deed contained covenants of general warranty, quiet enjoyment, and right to convey. Pat handed the deed to Marian who immediately returned it to her father for safekeeping. Her father kept it in his safe deposit box. The deed was not recorded. The property at 44 Main Street covered 7/8 of an acre of land, had a dwelling and a garage situate thereon, and was subject to a right of way, described in prior deeds, in favor of Jack, a neighbor. Pat owned no other land on Main Street. Jack had not used the right of way for ten years and it was not visible on inspection of the property. The description of 44 Main Street was
591	A landowner developed and built a large apartment house on property he owned. After the apartment house was completed, the landowner conveyed the building and the land to his son for life, remainder to his granddaughter; subject, however, to a bank's mortgage. The bank held a mortgage on the building for $17,000, payable in annual installments of $2,000 plus interest. The son began to manage the day-to-day maintenance of the building as well as to collect rents. Despite the son's best efforts, the vacancy factor reached an unanticipated high and the rental income was not sufficient to cover the annual mortgage payment. Who is responsible for the mortgage payments and in what amount?
592	A landowner leased 150 acres of farmland to a produce company for 15 years. The produce company used the land for crops along with severalnother contiguous acres that it owned or leased. About four years into the lease, the state condemned a portion of the leased property because it intended to build a highway. As a result, too little property remained for the produce company to profitably farm, although there still existed the farmhouse on the property, which was being used by one of its foremen. The produce company gave the landowner 30 days' written notice that it considered the lease to have been terminated because of the condemnation. In a suit for breach of contract, the landowner would probably:
593	The State of Missoula has enacted a new election code designed to increase voter responsibility in the exercise of the franchise and to enlarge citizen participation in the electoral process. None of its provisions conflicts with federal statutes. Which of the following is the strongest reason for finding unconstitutional a requirement in the Missoula election code that each voter must be literate in English?
594	Defendant sold heroin to Morgan. Morgan was later stopped by police for speeding. The police searched Morgan's car and found the heroin concealed under the rear seat. Defendant is charged with illegally selling heroin. Defendant's motion to prevent introduction of the heroin into evidence will most probably be
595	Pocket, a bank vice president, took substantial kickbacks to approve certain loans that later proved worthless. Upon learning of the kickbacks, Dudd, the bank's president, fired Pocket, telling him, "If you are not out of this bank in ten minutes, I will have the guards throw you out bodily." Pocket left at once. If Pocket asserts a claim against Dudd based on assault, will Pocket prevail?
596	Decker, charged with armed robbery of a store, denied that he was the person who had robbed the store. In presenting the state's case, the prosecutor seeks to introduce evidence that Decker had robbed two other stores in the past year. This evidence is
597	The laws of the state provide that "any person who engages in sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 16 shall have committed the crime of statutory rape." A waitress propositioned the defendant to have a sexual encounter at a nearby hotel. When they got up to the room, she told the defendant that she would be 16 the next week. In fact, the waitress, who had been adopted, was mistaken about her actual birth date; she had actually turned 16 the week before. The waitress and the defendant engage in sexual intercourse, and the defendant is subsequently charged with statutory rape. The defendant should be found:
598	A recently enacted state law forbids aliens from owning more than 100 acres of land within the state and directs the state attorney general to bring an action of ejectment whenever an alien owns such land. Zane, a resident alien, located and purchased 200 acres of land in the state after passage of that law. He brings an action in federal court to enjoin the state attorney general from enforcing the statute against him. The defendant moves to dismiss the complaint. The federal court should
599	While hiking through an area that had been recently devastated by a fire, a hiker discovered a sign that stated: "Now Entering State Wilderness Area." Thinking that the sign would make a nice decoration, the hiker took the sign home with him. He was arrested and charged with violating a state statute that provides, "Any person who appropriates to his own use property owned by the state shall be guilty of a crime." At trial, the hiker admitted taking the sign, but claimed that he believed the sign had been abandoned, given that the area had recently been devastated by a fire. In fact, the sign had not been abandoned. If the jury believes the hiker, he will most likely be found:
600	Oscar purchased a large bottle of No-Flake dandruff shampoo, manufactured by Shampoo Company. The box containing the bottle stated in part: "CAUTION--Use only 1 capful at most once a day. Greater use may cause severe damage to the scalp." Oscar read the writing on the box, removed the bottle, and threw the box away. Oscar's roommate, Paul, asked to use the No-Flake, and Oscar said, "Be careful not to use too much." Paul thereafter used No-Flake twice a day, applying two or three capfuls each time, notwithstanding the label statement that read: "Use no more than one capful per day. See box instructions." The more he used No-Flake, the more inflamed his scalp became, the more it itched, and the more he used. After three weeks of such use, Paul finally consulted a doctor who diagnosed his problem as a serious and irreversible case of dermatitis caused by excessive exposure to the active ingredients in No-Flake. These ingredients are uniquely effective at controlling dandruff, but there is no way to remove a remote risk to a small percentage of persons who may contract dermatitis as the result of applying for prolonged periods of time amounts of No-Flake substantially in excess of the directions. This jurisdiction adheres to the traditional common-law rules pertaining to contributory negligence and assumption of risk. If Paul asserts a claim for his injuries against Shampoo Company based on strict liability in tort, which of the following would constitute a defense? I. Paul misused the No-Flake shampoo. II. Paul was contributorily negligent in continuing to use No-Flake shampoo when his scalp began to hurt and itch. III. Paul was a remote user and not in privity with Shampoo Company.
601	On April 1, the owner of a high-end boutique and a dress designer signed a written agreement wherein the boutique owner was appointed the "sole and exclusive" retail distributor for the designer's clothing in an upscale community. The contract provided that the designer was to have the absolute right to cease doing business with the boutique owner "at any time and on 30 days' notice." On May 1, the boutique owner handed the designer a written order for $50,000 worth of his original gowns. To publicize her new line of merchandise, the boutique owner conducted a large advertising campaign announcing to the community that she would have a wide selection of the designer's originals on display. She also made substantial improvements to the store to display these clothes in lush and expensive settings. On June 15, the designer faxed the boutique owner advising her that her competitor had made a proposal that he simply could not pass up, so he was invoking his right to terminate their arrangement on July 15. On receipt of the message, the boutique owner filed suit against the designer, seeking to prevent him from terminating the exclusivity agreement. In defense, the designer contended, among other things, that the April 1 exclusivity agreement with the boutique owner is unenforceable for lack of consideration, because the boutique owner did not obligate herself under the contract in any way. The best argument to rebut this contention is:
602	The owner of an art gallery entered into a written contract with an avid art collector whereby the art collector agreed to buy and the gallery owner agreed to sell for $7,500 any painting in the gallery by artist Alpha. The contract was to be executed on July 6 according to its written terms. The art collector went to the gallery on July 6 with a certified check in the amount of $7,500. The art collector pointed out a painting by a different artist hanging on the wall, and told the gallery owner that that was the painting he wanted, and that he would also take its old-fashioned $250 gilt frame to go with it. The gallery owner responded that the painting was by the artist Beta, but that the art collector could have it with the frame if he was willing to pay $250 extra for it. This enraged the art collector, and he filed suit against the gallery owner, asserting in his pleading that he remains able and willing to tender $7,500 to the gallery owner. He also asserts that prior to signing the contract, the parties agreed orally that the art collector could have a painting by Beta for the same price in lieu of one by Alpha, and that the gallery owner would throw in the frame for whatever painting he chose. The gallery owner denied that any such conversation took place. There are no other witnesses. The court should allow the art collector to testify regarding:
603	Neighbor, who lived next door to Homeowner, went into Homeowner's garage without permission and borrowed Homeowner's chain saw. Neighbor used the saw to clear broken branches from the trees on Neighbor's own property. After he had finished, Neighbor noticed several broken branches on Homeowner's trees that were in danger of falling on Homeowner's roof. While Neighbor was cutting Homeowner's branches, the saw broke. In a suit for conversion by Homeowner against Neighbor, will Homeowner recover?
604	A wholesaler who sold hair-care products to beauty salons and spas contracted to purchase 20 hand-held ionic hair dryers to be delivered no later than May 1. She paid for the hair dryers at the time she placed her order. When the hair dryers were delivered on May 1, the wholesaler noticed that they were hot air, and not ionic, hair dryers. She immediately contacted the manufacturer, which refused to grant the wholesaler any remedy. If the wholesaler keeps the hair dryers and brings a claim for breach of contract against the manufacturer, and the court determines that the hair dryers are nonconforming, what are the wholesaler's remedies?
605	A bakery owner entered into a one-year written contract with a chocolate chip manufacturer whereby the manufacturer agreed to ship to the bakery owner 5,000 pounds of premium chocolate chips on the first day of each month for $12,500 per shipment. When the bakery owner opened the first shipment of chips, he found that 60% of them were tainted with rat hairs. He immediately called the manufacturer and reported the breach. The manufacturer offered to send replacements, but the bakery owner refused the offer and canceled the entire contract. Will the manufacturer prevail in an action against the bakery owner seeking contract damages?
606	Arnold and Beverly owned a large tract of land, Blackacre, in fee simple as joint tenants with rights of survivorship. While Beverly was on an extended safari in Kenya, Arnold learned that there were very valuable coal deposits within Blackacre, but he made no attempt to inform Beverly. Thereupon, Arnold conveyed his interest in Blackacre to his wife, Alice, who immediately reconveyed that interest to Arnold. The common-law joint tenancy is unmodified by statute. Shortly thereafter, Arnold was killed in an automobile accident. His will, which was duly probated, specifically devised his one-half interest in Blackacre to Alice. Beverly then returned from Kenya and learned what had happened. Beverly brought an appropriate action against Alice, who claimed a one-half interest in Blackacre, seeking a declaratory judgment that she, Beverly, was the sole owner of Blackacre. In this action, who should prevail?
607	To prevent the Supreme Court from whittling away the protections that previous Supreme Court decisions had created for individuals accused of crimes, Congress passed a law eliminating from Supreme Court jurisdiction all cases in which a state supreme court has decided that a defendant's federal constitutional rights have been violated. If the statute is held unconstitutional, it will most likely be because:
608	A city condemned all of the buildings in a decaying warehouse district and offered them to developers at no cost, provided the developer submits a building revitalization plan to the city's planning commission, the commission approves the plan, and the developer pays the city's redevelopment authority to perform the work needed to revitalize the building. An experienced developer submitted a plan to revitalize a block-long building, and his plan was approved by the planning commission. However, the developer wanted to perform the revitalization work himself, both to ensure that the job was done correctly and to save a substantial amount of money. Although he offered to post a surety bond to insure his performance, the city refused his offer. As applied to the contractor, is the city's requirement that the developer use the city's redevelopment authority constitutional?
609	With the stated aim of protecting minors from the perceived evils of offensive but not necessarily obscene materials, a state legislature enacted a statute banning the commercial licensing of video arcade games with a specifically defined degree of sexual content. Under the statute, the owner of a chain of shopping mall video arcades in the state was denied licenses for a number of video games that he wanted to install at his arcades. He challenges the statute in federal district court. The court will probably find the statute:
610	A farmer willed his farm to his daughter. The will stated that the property would go to the daughter for her life with a remainder to each of her children living at the time of the farmer's death. The will further provided that "The interest of any child who attempts to mortgage or sell his or her interest shall immediately terminate and shall pass to and become the property of the remaining children of my daughter who are alive at the time of my death, in equal shares." Several weeks later the farmer died. One of the daughter's three children wants to sell his interest in the farm. The daughter and the two other children object to the sale. In an action for declaratory relief by the grandson that the stated restriction on the sale is void, what would be the probable result?
611	On September 1, a law school professor announced to his class that he would pay the tuition of the bar review course of the student's choice for the student who received the highest grade in his Constitutional Law class. A week later, one student in the professor's class told the professor that he was giving his best effort to get the highest grade in class to win the prize and had already purchased every substantive Constitutional Law outline on the market. Shortly thereafter, the dean of the law school learned of the contest and informed the professor that it was against school policy. On October 1, the professor told his class that he was withdrawing his offer. Which of the following statements about the professor's October 1 announcement is correct?
612	Plaintiff, a jockey, was seriously injured in a race when another jockey, Daring, cut too sharply in front of her without adequate clearance. The two horses collided, causing Plaintiff to fall to the ground, sustaining injury. The State Racetrack Commission ruled that, by cutting in too sharply, Daring committed a foul in violation of racetrack rules requiring adequate clearance for crossing lanes. Plaintiff has brought an action against Daring for damages in which one count is based on battery. Will Plaintiff prevail on the battery claim?
613	To protect its faltering lobster industry, the state of Blue enacted a statute providing that no lobster shall be taken from lobster beds lying within three miles of the state shoreline unless it is at least one pound in weight (the purpose of which is to enable young lobsters to reproduce before being caught). At the same time, Congress enacted a lobster conservation act that provides $5 million for research funds to develop and improve breeding grounds for lobsters and imposes a special excise tax of $1,000 on each lobster caught in violation of state law if later shipped in interstate commerce. A lobsterman who lives in the state of Green, which is just south of the state of Blue, crossed over into waters lying within three miles of the Blue coastline. He was arrested by state Blue law enforcement officers for taking lobsters that weighed less than one pound. The man defended the charge by challenging the constitutionality of the state Blue statute. Which of the following results is most likely?
614	Owens owned Whiteacre, a dwelling house situated on a two-acre lot in an area zoned for single-family residential uses only. Although it was not discernible from the outside, Whiteacre had been converted by Owens from a single-family house to a structure that contained three separate apartments, in violation of the zoning ordinance. Further, the conversion was in violation of the building code. Owens and Peters entered into a valid written contract for the purchase and sale of Whiteacre. The contract provided that Owens was to convey to Peters a marketable title. The contract was silent as to zoning. Peters had fully inspected Whiteacre. Prior to the closing, Peters learned that Whiteacre did not conform to the zoning ordinance and refused to close although Owens was ready, willing, and able to perform his contract obligations. Owens brought an appropriate action for specific performance against Peters. In that action, Owens should
615	Davis decided to kill Adams. He set out for Adams' house. Before he got there he saw Brooks, who resembled Adams. Thinking Brooks was Adams, Davis shot at Brooks. The shot missed Brooks but wounded Case, who was some distance away. Davis had not seen Case. In a prosecution under a statute that proscribes attempt to commit murder, the district attorney should indicate that the intended victim(s) was (were)
616	Pike sued Day City Community Church for damages he suffered when Pike crashed his motorcycle in an attempt to avoid a cow that had escaped from its corral. The cow and corral belonged to a farm that had recently been left by will to the church. At trial, Pike seeks to ask Defendant's witness, Winters, whether she is a member of that church. The question is
617	A landowner nearing retirement hired a company to clear all the trees from a specified portion of a plot of land he owned in the woods and to build a rustic log cabin on the property with those trees. Under the contract, the landowner was to make payments to the company of $10,000 on the first of every month for nine months beginning August 1, on monthly presentation of a certificate by an environmental protection group certifying that construction was proceeding in an ecologically sound manner. The company cleared the trees in July and began working on the cabin. The landowner made three $10,000 payments for the work done in July, August, and September, without requiring a certificate. The company worked through October, but no work was done from November 1 to the end of February because of bad weather, and the landowner made no payments during that period. The company did not object. On March 1, the company demanded payment of $10,000; but the landowner refused on the grounds that no construction work had been done for four months and the environmental protection group had issued no certificate. The company thereupon abandoned work and repudiated the agreement. Assuming that the company committed a total breach on March 1, what would be the probable measure of the landowner's damages in an action against the company for breach of contract?
618	A landowner devised her home "to my daughter for life, then to the eldest survivor of her two children, my grandson and granddaughter, for life, remainder to the eldest surviving offspring of the two grandchildren who is alive at the death of the last life tenant." After the landowner's death, the daughter lived in the family home for 15 years. Upon the daughter's death, both of her children were alive, so the home passed to the grandson, the eldest. He lived in the house for three years, and then conveyed it to the city historical society, which converted it into its headquarters and museum. Eight years later, the grandson died. At the time of his death, he was survived by his widow, his two sons, the granddaughter, and the granddaughter's daughter, who was the eldest of the niece and nephews. Four years after the grandson's death, the granddaughter's daughter brought an action for ejectment and to quiet title against the city historical society. The jurisdiction has a statutory period of adverse possession of 10 years, or five years if entry was made by the adverse possessor under color of title. How should the court rule in the granddaughter's daughter's action?
619	Zall, a resident of the state of Paxico, brought suit in federal district court against Motors, Inc., a Paxico corporation. Zall seeks recovery of $12,000 actual and $12,000 punitive damages arising from Motors' sale to him of a defective automobile. Zall's suit is based only on a common law contract theory. From a constitutional standpoint, should the federal district court hear this suit on its merits?
620	A homeowner bought "20-pound test" fishing line for hanging potted plants on his porch. "20-pound test" in the fishing industry means that fishing line will not break under an initial stress of up to 20 pounds when a hooked fish tugs against the line, but not that it will support a constant 20-pound weight. Most sportfishers are aware of this technical meaning, but most laypersons are not, and the manufacturer put no warnings or explanations on the package in which the line was sold. The homeowner hung a 15-pound basket from his front porch, directly above an old-fashioned porch swing. A friend visiting the homeowner was sitting on the swing when the line holding the basket broke, causing the plant to fall and strike the guest on the head. Will the guest prevail against the homeowner in a suit to recover damages for her injuries?
621	Thirty years ago Able, the then-record owner of Greenacre, a lot contiguous to Blueacre, in fee simple, executed and delivered to Baker an instrument in writing which was denominated "Deed of Conveyance." In pertinent part it read, "Able does grant to Baker and her heirs and assigns a right-of-way for egress and ingress to Blueacre." If the quoted provision was sufficient to create an interest in land, the instrument met all other requirements for a valid grant. Baker held record title in fee simple to Blueacre, which adjoined Greenacre. Twelve years ago Charlie succeeded to Able's title in fee simple in Greenacre and seven years ago Dorcas succeeded to Baker's title in fee simple in Blueacre by a deed which made no mention of a right-of-way or driveway. At the time Dorcas took title, there existed a driveway across Greenacre which showed evidence that it had been used regularly to travel between Main Road, a public road, and Blueacre. Blueacre did have frontage on Side Road, another public road, but this means of access was seldom used because it was not as convenient to the dwelling situated on Blueacre as was Main Road. The driveway originally was established by Baker. Dorcas has regularly used the driveway since acquiring title. The period of time required to acquire rights by prescription in the jurisdiction is ten years. Six months ago Charlie notified Dorcas that Charlie planned to develop a portion of Greenacre as a residential subdivision and that Dorcas should cease any use of the driveway. After some negotiations, Charlie offered to permit Dorcas to construct another driveway to connect with the streets of the proposed subdivision. Dorcas declined this offer on the ground that travel from Blueacre to Main Road would be more circuitous. Dorcas brought an appropriate action against Charlie to obtain a definitive adjudication of the respective rights of Dorcas and Charlie. In such lawsuit Charlie relied upon the defense that the location of the easement created by the grant from Able to Baker was governed by reasonableness and that Charlie's proposed solution was reasonable. Charlie's defense should
622	A state statute prohibits merchants from selling goods manufactured in a foreign country unless the merchant clearly marks the goods with their country of origin. The United States has a treaty with a foreign country that allows each country to import and sell goods and products from the other country. If a person is prosecuted under the state law for refusing to mark goods as being of that foreign country's origin, which of the following statements reflects the most likely outcome of the case?
623	A landlord leased her home to a tenant for 10 years. The lease provided, "On payment of the purchase price of $100,000 during the lease term or any renewal term, the landlord covenants and agrees to convey the said home to the tenant, his successors and assigns, by a recordable instrument having good and marketable title in fee simple." Five years later, the tenant assigned the remainder of the lease term to a friend with the landlord's consent. Six months ago, the friend sought to exercise the option to purchase the home for $100,000, but the landlord refused. The friend brought an appropriate action for specific performance. The jurisdiction in which the home is located follows the common law Rule Against Perpetuities. For whom should the court rule?
624	A public high school's drug policy strictly prohibited the use, possession, or sale of any drug on school grounds, including any prescription or over-the-counter medication, unless supervised by a nurse. During lunch, the school principal observed a student ingesting two white pills. The student admitted to the principal that the pills were aspirins and had been given to her by a senior. School officials approached the senior and demanded to search her backpack. When no aspirins were found in the backpack, the officials required the senior to submit to a private physical search by the female school nurse. Some aspirins were subsequently found in the waistband of the senior's gym shorts that she was wearing under her school uniform, and she was suspended. The senior's mother sued school officials, claiming that the physical search violated her daughter's Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures. In response, the school officials filed a motion for summary judgment against the mother's claim. Assuming that the facts above are stipulated to by the parties, the motion should be:
625	Beach owned a tract of land called Blackacre. An old road ran through Blackacre from the abutting public highway. The road had been used to haul wood from Blackacre. Without Beach's permission and with no initial right, Daniel, the owner of Whiteacre, which adjoined Blackacre, traveled over the old road for a period of 15 years to obtain access to Whiteacre, although Whiteacre abutted another public road. Occasionally, Daniel made repairs to the old road. The period of time to acquire rights by prescription in the jurisdiction is ten years. After the expiration of 15 years, Beach conveyed a portion of Blackacre to Carrol. The deed included the following clause: "together with the right to pass and repass at all times and for all purposes over the old road." Carrol built a house fronting on the old road. The road was severely damaged by a spring flood, and Carrol made substantial repairs to the road. Carrol asked Daniel and Beach to contribute one-third each to the cost of repairing the flood damage. They both refused, and Carrol brought an appropriate action to compel contribution from Beach and Daniel. In this action, Carrol will
626	A newsstand owner leased space in an office building. An investor purchased the office building and told the newsstand owner that he wanted to negotiate a new lease. During the negotiations, the newsstand owner and the investor orally agreed that the newsstand owner would have the exclusive right to sell newspapers and magazines in the office building. The investor prepared a written lease outlining the agreement, but forgot to include the agreement that the newsstand owner would have exclusive rights in the office building. The newsstand owner was given a copy of the lease to read, but he merely glanced over the lease because he assumed that it reflected his agreement with the investor. The newsstand owner then signed the lease, which included a merger and integration clause. One month later, the investor leased space in the building to a drugstore. The drugstore's lease did not prevent it from selling newspapers or magazines. As a result of the competition, the newsstand owner lost substantial profits in his business. The newsstand owner brings suit to reform the contract to reflect his exclusive right to sell newspapers and magazines in the office building. The most likely result of this suit is that:
627	A local entertainment section of a newspaper published a story on the town's business district, accompanied by photos of various businesses in the district. A minister who happened to be walking on the sidewalk in front of an adult bookstore when a photo was taken for the story became very upset when he saw it in the newspaper, because the camera angle made it appear that he was exiting the bookstore. If the minister sues the newspaper for invasion of privacy and establishes the above facts, he likely will:
628	A bar owner applied to the state liquor board for transfer of the license of his bar to a new site. The board held a hearing on the application. At that hearing, a woman appeared without being subpoenaed and stated that the bar owner had underworld connections. Although the woman did not know this information to be true, she had heard rumors about the bar owner's character and had noticed several underworld figures going in and out of his bar. In fact, the bar owner had no underworld connections. The liquor board ultimately granted the bar owner's application. In a claim against the woman based on defamation, the bar owner will:
629	A patient complaining of pain in his side underwent a physical exam and X-rays, which showed that the patient had a small surgeon's clamp lodged in his left side. It had been left in the patient during an operation nine years previously. The patient brought an action against the hospital and the surgeon who operated on him, alleging negligence. The hospital and the surgeon filed a general denial and a special affirmative defense alleging that the statute of limitations is a bar to the action. Recovery for negligence in the jurisdiction is limited to two years. The patient's attorney makes a motion to strike the special affirmative defense. The motion should be:
630	Tom had a heart ailment so serious that his doctors had concluded that only a heart transplant could save his life. They therefore arranged to have him flown to Big City to have the operation performed. Dan, Tom's nephew, who stood to inherit from him, poisoned him. The poison produced a reaction which required postponing the journey. The plane on which Tom was to have flown crashed, and all aboard were killed. By the following day, Tom's heart was so weakened by the effects of the poison that he suffered a heart attack and died. If charged with criminal homicide, Dan should be found
631	Lanny, the owner of Whiteacre in fee simple, leased Whiteacre to Teri for a term of ten years by properly executed written instrument. The lease was promptly and properly recorded. It contained an option for Teri to purchase Whiteacre by tendering $250,000 as purchase price any time "during the term of this lease." One year later, Teri, by a properly executed written instrument, purported to assign the option to Oscar, expressly retaining all of the remaining term of the lease. The instrument of assignment was promptly and properly recorded. Two years later, Lanny contracted to sell Whiteacre to Jones and to convey a marketable title "subject to the rights of Teri under her lease." Jones refused to close because of the outstanding option assigned to Oscar. Lanny brought an appropriate action against Jones for specific performance. If judgment is rendered in favor of Lanny, it will be because the relevant jurisdiction has adopted a rule on a key issue as to which various state courts have split. Which of the following identifies the determinative rule or doctrine upon which the split occurs, and states the position favorable to Lanny?
632	The owner of a pet shop received a flyer from a professional bird breeder that included the following: "Lovebirds! $119.95 a pair! Delivery in 4-6 weeks. Terms of sale, cash within 30 days of delivery." The shop owner called the bird breeder on April 26, ordering one pair of lovebirds and paying by credit card in the amount of $119.95. After looking over the order the next day, the bird breeder sent a letter to the shop owner indicating that there was a mistake in the advertisement; it should have read "$119.95 per bird." The bird breeder went on to state that she would ship the pair of birds to the shop owner if she would pay the additional $119.95 on receipt of the birds. By return mail, the shop owner authorized the breeder to ship the pair of lovebirds and agreed to pay the additional $119.95, but she noted that they must be delivered on or before May 21. The bird breeder immediately sent a fax to the shop owner agreeing to deliver the birds to her by May 21. However, the birds did not arrive at her shop until June 1. Is the breeder entitled to recover the additional $119.95?
633	Patron ate a spicy dinner at Restaurant on Sunday night. He enjoyed the food and noticed nothing unusual about the dinner. Later that evening, Patron had an upset stomach. He slept well through the night, went to work the next day, and ate three meals. His stomach discomfort persisted, and by Tuesday morning he was too ill to go to work. Eventually, Patron consulted his doctor, who found that Patron was infected with a bacterium that can be contracted from contaminated food. Food can be contaminated when those who prepare it do not adequately wash their hands. Patron sued Restaurant for damages. He introduced testimony from a health department official that various health code violations had been found at Restaurant both before and after Patron's dinner, but that none of Restaurant's employees had signs of bacterial infection when they were tested one month after the incident. Restaurant's best argument in response to Patron's suit would be that
634	Perez sued Dawson for damages arising out of an automobile collision. At trial, Perez called Minter, an eyewitness to the collision. Perez expected Minter to testify that she had observed Dawson's automobile for five seconds prior to the collision and estimated Dawson's speed at the time of the collision to have been 50 miles per hour. Instead, Minter testified that she estimated Dawson's speed to have been 25 miles per hour. Without finally excusing Minter as a witness, Perez then called Wallingford, a police officer, to testify that Minter had told him during his investigation at the accident scene that Dawson "was doing at least 50." Wallingford's testimony is
635	An investor and a sports club owned adjacent parcels of land in an area that was zoned for commercial use. The sports club constructed four tennis courts on its property and equipped them with bright lights for night use. The tennis court operated 365 days a year and was kept open until 2 a.m. Five years later, a new shopping center was built one mile from their parcels of land, making them highly desirable for residential purposes. The investor decided to construct several residential units on his property and had his property rezoned for residential use, but his architect informed him that, because of the lights, the residences facing the tennis courts would have to be equipped with lightproof draperies that would have to be kept closed until after the tennis courts close each night. If the investor asserts a claim based on nuisance against the sports club, who is likely to prevail?
636	Plaintiff sued Defendant for injuries sustained in an automobile collision. During Plaintiffs hospital stay, Doctor, a staff physician, examined Plaintiffs X rays and said to Plaintiff, "You have a fracture of two vertebrae, C4 and C5." Intern, who was accompanying Doctor on her rounds, immediately wrote the diagnosis on Plaintiff's hospital record. At trial, the hospital records custodian testifies that Plaintiff's hospital record was made and kept in the ordinary course of the hospital's business. The entry reporting Doctor's diagnosis is
637	Under a written agreement Superpastries, Inc., promised to sell its entire output of baked buns at a specified unit price to Bonnie's Buns, Inc., a retailer, for one year. Bonnie's Buns promised not to sell any other supplier's baked buns. For this question only, assume the following facts. Shortly after making the contract, and before Superpastries had tendered any buns, Bonnie's Buns decided that the contract had become undesirable because of a sudden, sharp decline in its customers' demand for baked buns. It renounced the agreement, and Superpastries sues for breach of contract. Which of the following will the court probably decide?
638	A doll collector knew that an acquaintance from her doll collectors' club coveted one particular doll that she owned. The doll collector mailed a letter to the acquaintance on May 3 offering to sell the doll to her for $750. Her letter arrived on May 4. On May 5, the doll collector changed her mind and immediately mailed a revocation to the acquaintance. This revocation arrived on May 7. As the mail carrier handed it to her, the acquaintance simultaneously handed to the mail carrier her own letter to the doll collector, unequivocally accepting her offer. What is the result of the actions here?
639	A salesman was staying at a hotel for a convention. Hotels in the area near the convention had been experiencing a series of robberies where the robber would break into the locked hotel room and then rob his victim by threatening the victim with a gun. In response, the hotel where the salesman was staying had recently re-inspected its rooms to ensure that its hotel room locks were secure and in compliance with state requirements. Nevertheless, one night during the convention, the robber broke into the salesman's room in the same manner as his other robberies. Instead of threatening to shoot, however, the robber hit the salesman over the head with a blackjack, seriously injuring him. If the salesman sues the hotel for his injuries and does not prevail, it will be because:
640	The sales representative of a hot dog company gave the proprietor of a corner hot dog stand a poster of an actress endorsing those hot dogs, which the proprietor put in the window. Sales picked up, but the actress filed suit against the proprietor for invasion of privacy because, in fact, she was a spokesperson for a rival hot dog company. Will the actress prevail?
641	Powell, who was an asbestos insulation installer from 1955 to 1965, contracted asbestosis, a serious lung disorder, as a result of inhaling airborne asbestos particles on the job. The asbestos was manufactured and sold to Powell's employer by the Acme Asbestos Company. Because neither Acme nor anyone else discovered the risk to asbestos installers until 1966, Acme did not provide any warnings of the risks to installers until after that date. Powell brought an action against Acme based on strict liability in tort for failure to warn. The case is to be tried before a jury. The jurisdiction has not adopted a comparative fault rule in strict liability cases. In this action, an issue that is relevant to the case and is a question for the court to decide as a matter of law, rather than for the jury to decide as a question of fact, is whether
642	A homeowner looked out his front window one day and saw a neighbor standing on a narrow ledge on the second story of the house across the street. He also saw a ladder lying on the ground beneath where the neighbor was stranded. The homeowner ran out and picked up the ladder and placed it against the side of the house. However, he set it atop a patch of ice. As the neighbor started down the ladder, a rotten rung broke and he fell to the ground and was injured. If the neighbor sues the homeowner for damages for his injuries, will he recover?
643	An aspiring chef who made homemade hot sauce posted a notice on a bulletin board in a local grocery store stating: "Get a bottle of the hottest hot sauce on earth for only $5 directly from the maker. Not available in stores." The ad listed the man's home mailing address at the bottom. An entrepreneur wrote a letter to the address asking, "What's your price for a case of hot sauce?" The man sent a written reply that said in its entirety, "I can do 12 bottles for $50. Sound good?" The entrepreneur subsequently mailed a check to the man in the appropriate amount, with a memo enclosed saying, "I accept your offer for a case of hot sauce." The man shipped the case to the entrepreneur after receiving his check and memo, and with the shipment sent the entrepreneur an invoice that conspicuously stated the following lawful provision: "These items shall not be offered for resale at retail." The entrepreneur received and read, but disregarded, the invoice restriction and began reselling the bottles for double the price he paid. The man has a cause of action against the entrepreneur for breach of contract only if:
644	A manufacturer of a very popular, artisanal red cheese enters into an agreement with a retail seller of gourmet foods. The agreement provides that the retailer will buy and the manufacturer will sell all of the red cheese that the retailer requires for two years at $500 per 10-wheel container. In the past two years, the retailer has sold 10 containers per year but estimates that it could sell twice that amount with a steady supply. Under the above facts, what are the relative obligations of the manufacturer and the retailer?
645	Paul, the Plaintiff in a personal injury action, called Wes as a witness to testify that Dan's car, in which Paul had been riding. ran a red light. Wes, however, testified that Dan's car did not run the light. On cross-examination of Vic, Dan's attorney asked if Vic was drunk at the time he witnessed the accident. and Vic responded, "No I have never in my life been drunk." Dan's attorney then sought to prove by Yank that Vic was drunk on New Year's Eve two years before the accident. The trialjudge should rule that Yank's testimony is
646	In 1945 Owen, owner of both Blackacre and Whiteacre, executed and delivered two separate deeds by which he conveyed the two tracts of land as follows: Blackacre was conveyed "To Alpha and his heirs as long as it is used exclusively for residential purposes, but if it is ever used for other than residential purposes, to the American Red Cross." Whiteacre was conveyed "To Beta and her heirs as long as it is used exclusively for residential purposes, but if it is used for other than residential purposes prior to 1965, then to the Salvation Army." In 1950 Owen died leaving a valid will by which he devised all his real estate to his brother, Bill. The will had no residuary clause. Owen was survived by Bill and by Owen's daughter, Della, who was Owen's sole heir. For the purpose of this set of questions, it may be assumed that the common law rule against perpetuities applies in the state where the land is located and that the state also has a statute providing that, "All future estates and interests are alienable, descendible, and devisable in the same manner as possessory estates and interests." In 1955 Alpha and Della entered into a contract with John whereby Alpha and Della contracted to sell Blackacre to John in fee simple. After examining title, John refused to perform on the ground that Alpha and Della could not give good title. Alpha and Della joined in an action against John for specific performance. Prayer for specific performance will be
647	A missionary was travelling door to door hoping to convert others to his church. At one house, a devout elderly woman answered the door and the two began discussing their religious differences. The conversation took a disagreeable turn, and the woman, greatly offended, slammed her door shut. The missionary had been leaning with his hand on the doorway during their conversation, and as a consequence, his fingers were pinched in the door, causing him injury. If the missionary asserts a claim based on battery against the woman and prevails, it will be because:
648	Due to a notable increase in prostitution arrests in the state, the state legislature has enacted new regulations for massage parlors. The new law requires that all workers at any massage parlor or similar business be licensed by the state attorney general. This requirement is:
649	A 15-year-old boy living at home with his parents, who were having a dinner party, set up a practical joke where a bucket of water is balanced on a partially open door so that the next person to enter the room through that door is drenched. The boy set up the filled bucket on the partially open door of the guest bedroom, knowing that his father would take the guests' coats in there. The boy's father did not use the guest bedroom for the coats, but, later that evening, an invited guest of the boy's parents mistakenly wandered into the room. As the guest opened the door to the guest bedroom, the bucket of water plunged down on him, opening a four-inch cut in his scalp that required stitches. In an action by the guest against the boy and his parents for personal injuries, the court should determine the boy's culpability according to:
650	National regulation of predatory wild animals on federal lands is most likely
651	A defendant is on trial for stealing jewelry from his co-worker. The defendant claims that the co-worker sold the jewelry to him because she needed money to buy medicine for her sick mother. The defense witness is asked to testify as to the co-worker's reputation in the community. The witness testifies that the co-worker is known as a dishonest person who makes her living as a "con artist." Assuming appropriate objections by defense counsel, which of the following questions would not be proper on cross-examination of the witness by the prosecutor?
652	A state prohibits publication of the identity of victims of sexual crimes, but allows trials of such cases to be televised, as long as the victim's face is blocked out. Recently, the nephew of a United States Senator was accused of raping a woman at his family's estate in the state. Because of the notoriety of the senator's family, the press was eager to enlighten the public as to all aspects of the case. A reporter for a metropolitan newspaper published in the state discovered the name of the nephew's victim from a police report that inadvertently included the victim's name, and the newspaper published the victim's identity in the next edition of the paper. The reporter and the paper were fined $2,500 for violating the statute. If the reporter and the paper challenge the fine, the court should rule:
653	On November 1 the following notice was posted in a privately operated law school The faculty, seeking to encourage legal xesearch, offers to any student at this school who wins the current National Obscenity Law Competition the additional prize of $500. All competing papers must be submitted to the Dean's office before next May 1. (The National Competition is conducted by an outside agency, unconnected with any law school.) Student read this notice on November 2, and thereupon intensified his effort to make his paper on obscenity law, which he started in October, a winner. Student also left on a counter in the Dean's office a signed note saying, "I accept the faculty's $500 Obscenity Competition offer." This note was madvertently placed in Student's file and never reached the Dean or any faculty member personally. On the following April 1, the above notice was removed and the following substituted therefor: The faculty regrets that our offer regarding the National Obscenity Law Competition must be withdrawn. Student's paper was submitted through the Dean's office on April 15. On May 1, it was announced that Student had won the National Obscenity Law Competition and the prize of $1,000. The law faculty refused to pay anything. Assuming that the faculty's notice of November 1 was posted on a bulletin board or other conspicuous place commonly viewed by all persons in the law school, such notice constituted a
654	A classic car hobbyist attended a classic car show where he found a particular car he had always dreamed of owning. The owner of the car told him the car was for sale. He said that he had restored the classic car himself using nothing but genuine original parts. The owner also said that "this is the finest restoration of this type of car in the United States, and one of the two best in the world." After negotiating a price, the hobbyist agreed to purchase the car for a considerable sum. Later, the hobbyist discovered that the owner had not been truthful about the restoration. In his action for deceit, assuming that all the other elements of deceit are proven, which statement will support the hobbyist's claims?
655	A vintner owned a vineyard, which adjoined a public road. His neighbor owned the adjoining undeveloped lot, which was from a different original tract. The easiest practical access to the undeveloped lot was from the public road adjoining the vineyard. This required, however, that the neighbor cross the vineyard to reach the road. The vintner granted an easement to the neighbor, allowing her to "pass through" the vineyard on her journeys between the undeveloped lot and the road. The neighbor also wanted to develop her lot but no power lines had been installed to provide it with utility service. The neighbor consulted the vintner, but he refused to alter the wording of the easement. Although a power company had a statutory power of eminent domain, it refused to run power lines to the neighbor's property without the vintner's permission. Can the neighbor require the vintner to allow the power lines to be installed through the vineyard?
656	Pater and his adult daughter, Carmen, encountered Tertius, an old family friend, on the street. Carmen said to Tertius, "How about lending me $1,000 to buy a used car? I'll pay you back with interest one year from today." Pater added, "And if she doesn't pay it back as promised, I will." Tertius thereupon wrote out and handed to Carmen his personal check, payable to her, for $1,000, and Carmen subsequently used the funds to buy a used car. When the debt became due, both Carmen and Pater refused to repay it, or any part of it. In an action by Tertius against Pater to recover $1,000 plus interest, which of the following statements would summarize Pater's best defense?
657	In 1970, Oscar, owner of a 100-acre tract, prepared and duly recorded a subdivision plan called Happy Acres. The plan showed 90 one-acre lots and a ten-acre tract in the center that was designated "Future Public School." Oscar published and distributed a brochure promoting Happy Acres which emphasized the proximity of the lots to the school property and indicated potential tax savings "because the school district will not have to expend tax money to-acquire this property." There is no specific statute concerning the dedication of school sites. Oscar sold 50 of the lots to individual purchasers. Each deed referred to the recorded plan and also contained the following clause: "No mobile home shall be erected on any lot within Happy Acres." Sarah was one of the original purchasers from Oscar. In 1976, Oscar sold the remaining 40 lots and the ten-acre tract to Max by a deed which referred to the plan and contained the restriction relating to mobile homes. Max sold the 40 lots to individual purchasers and the ten-acre tract to Pete. None of the deeds from Max referred to the plan or contained any reference to mobile homes. Assume for this question only that Joe, who purchased his lot from Max, has placed a mobile home on it and that Sarah brings an action against Joe to force him to remove it. The result of this action will be in favor of
658	On June 1, Kravat, a manufacturer of men's neckties, received the following order from Clothier: "Ship 500 two-inch ties, assorted stripes, your catalogue No. V34. Delivery by July 1." On June 1, Kravat shipped 500 three-inch ties that arrived at Clothier's place of business on June 3. Clothier immediately telegraphed Kravat: "Reject your shipment. Order was for two-inch ties!" Clothier, however, did not ship the ties back to Kravat. Kravat replied by telegram: "Will deliver proper ties before July 1 Clothier received this telegram on June 4, but did not reply to it. On June 30, Kravat tendered 500 two-inch ties in assorted stripes, designated in his catalogue as item No. V34; but Clothier refused to accept them. Did Clothier properly reject the ties tendered on June 30?
659	A homeowner and a local builder entered into a written contract that called for the builder to build a second story onto the top of the homeowner's one-story residence. When scheduling conflicts arose, the builder asked the homeowner if they could substitute his buddy, an out-of-town builder who had comparable experience and skills, to perform the local builder's part of the contract. All of the parties agreed to the substitution. Unfortunately, the out-of-town builder made a major blunder that will be quite expensive to correct. Is the local builder liable to the homeowner for the cost of correcting the defect?
660	A landowner conveyed his land to a famous guitarist. The guitarist put the deed in his guitar case and took off for a three-week band tour. While the guitarist was out of town, the landowner offered to sell the same land to his neighbor for $5,000. Although the neighbor knew that the guitarist had already bought the land, the neighbor paid the landowner $5,000 and promptly recorded the deed she received. Thereafter, the neighbor conveyed the land to her ex-husband for $15,000. The ex-husband knew nothing about the guitarist's deed and promptly recorded the deed he received. Two weeks later, the guitarist returned and recorded his deed to the land. A month after that, the ex-husband conveyed the land to a buyer for $17,000. The buyer knew that the guitarist held a deed to the land, but paid the ex-husband $17,000 anyway. The buyer immediately recorded and filed an appropriate action against the guitarist and the ex-husband to determine ownership of the land. The land is situated in a state with the following statute: "No conveyance or mortgage of an interest in land is valid against any subsequent purchaser for value without notice thereof whose conveyance is first recorded." The court will most likely rule that:
661	By way of a gift, Pat executed a deed naming his daughter, Marian, as grantee. The deed contained descriptions as follows: (1) All of my land and dwelling known as 44 Main Street, Midtown, United States, being one acre. (2) All that part of my farm, being a square with 200foot sides, the southeast corner of which is in the north line of my neighbor, Julia Brown. The deed contained covenants of general warranty, quiet enjoyment, and right to convey. Pat handed the deed to Marian who immediately returned it to her father for safekeeping. Her father kept it in his safe deposit box. The deed was not recorded. The property at 44 Main Street covered 7/8 of an acre of land, had a dwelling and a garage situate thereon, and was subject to a right of way, described in prior deeds, in favor of Jack, a neighbor. Pat owned no other land on Main Street. Jack had not used the right of way for ten years and it was not visible on inspection of the property. The description of part of Pat's farm
662	Undercover police arrested a brother and a sister after a four-month investigation into a series of residential burglaries. During interrogation, the brother admitted that he had committed eight of the burglaries, including one where he stole a valuable painting that he "fenced" to the sister. According to the brother, the sister subsequently sold the painting and gave the brother a share of the sale price. The sister was charged with receipt of stolen property, a misdemeanor offense, and was subsequently convicted. The painting was not recovered and the owners filed suit against the sister for damages. At trial, the brother testified to having "fenced" the painting to the sister. If the owners' attorney tries to introduce a certified copy of the record of the sister's conviction to corroborate the brother's testimony that the sister possessed and sold the painting, on proper motion this evidence will be:
663	Young, believing that Brown suffered from arthritis, told her that for $100 he could cure her with a device he had invented. The device was a large box with a series of electric light bulbs along the sides. Brown, after examining the device, agreed to take the treatment, which consisted of placing her hands inside the box for several ten-minute periods. Brown gave Young $100 and went through the treatment. Young is charged with obtaining money by false pretenses. Each of the following, if true, will absolve Young of guilt for obtaining money by false pretenses EXCEPT:
664	To protect its citizens from the fluctuating price of energy, a state formed a state-owned electric company that operated exclusively within the state. The company provided electricity to residents of the various cities within the state on the basis of a rate schedule that reflected the historic costs associated with servicing each city. Under the schedule, electricity rates for citizens of a particular city were 15% higher than the premiums for any other city in the state. A group of residents from that city brings suit in state court to require the state electric company to make the premiums equal for everyone. The most likely result is:
665	In a medical malpractice action, a surgeon was called as an expert witness by the plaintiff and testified that the surgical procedure utilized by the defendant was so new and experimental as to constitute negligence under the accepted standard of practice in the relevant medical community. On cross-examination by the defendant's counsel, the surgeon was asked whether Modern Surgical Procedures was a reliable authority in his area of specialty. The surgeon said that it was and the defense counsel then asked if the surgeon had relied upon the treatise in reaching the conclusion that the defendant was negligent. The surgeon stated that he did not. Defense counsel now proposes to read a passage from the treatise stating that the surgical procedure at issue is widely accepted by responsible medical practitioners. The plaintiff's counsel objects. How should the court rule?
666	The owner of a summer house entered into a written agreement with a plumber. The contract contained a clause requiring all plumbing work to be completed by noon on June 1 and provided that the homeowner would pay the plumber $1,200 for his work. The plumber began working on the job on May 28. When he quit working for the day on the afternoon of May 29, half of the job was completed. Shortly thereafter, a heavy rain began which caused a flash flood the next day, which swept the house away. Which of the following best describes the obligations of the plumber and the homeowner after the flood?
667	Passer was driving his pickup truck along a lonely road on a very cold night. Passer saw Tom, who was a stranger, lying in a field by the side of the road and apparently injured. Passer stopped his truck, alighted, and, upon examining Tom, discovered that Tom was intoxicated and in danger of suffering from exposure to the cold. However, Passer returned to his truck and drove away without making any effort to help Tom. Tom remained lying at the same place and was later injured when struck by a car driven by Traveler. Traveler, who was drowsy and inattentive, had veered off the road into the field and hit Tom. Traveler did not see Tom prior to hitting him. If Tom asserts a claim against Passer for damages for his injuries, will Tom prevail?
668	Storekeeper, the owner of a large hardware store, sells power saws for both personal and commercial use. He often takes old power saws as trade-ins on new ones. The old power saws are then completely disassembled and rebuilt with new bearings by Storekeeper's employees and sold by Storekeeper as "reconditioned saws. " Purchaser, the owner and operator of a cabinetmaking shop, informed Storekeeper that he wanted to buy a reconditioned circular saw for use in his cabinetmaking business. However, the blade that was on the saw he picked out had very coarse teeth for cutting rough lumber. Purchaser told Storekeeper that he wanted a saw blade that would cut plywood. Storekeeper exchanged the coarse blade for a new one with finer teeth that would cut plywood smoothly. The new blade was manufactured by Saw- Blade Company, which uses all available techniques to inspect its products for defects. The reconditioned saw had been manufactured by Power Saw Company. The week after the saw was purchased, Employee, who works for Purchaser in Purchaser's cabinetmaking shop, was injured while using the saw. Employee's arm was severely cut. As a result, the cabinetmaking shop was shut down for a week until a replacement for Employee could be found. If Employee was injured while cutting plywood when the shaft holding the saw blade came loose when a bearing gave way and the shaft and blade flew off the saw, and if Employee asserts a claim based on strict liability in tort against Storekeeper, Employee probably will
669	In a lawsuit over ownership of stereo equipment between two roommates, the plaintiff testified that he purchased the equipment one year ago for his DJ business. The defendant offers the testimony of a clerk at the electronics store where the equipment was purchased. The clerk testifies that she remembers that the sale of the equipment occurred 10 months ago, not one year ago, because the purchase order was signed with such a distinctive signature. However, she cannot remember whether it was purchased by the defendant or the plaintiff. If the plaintiff objects to this testimony, should the trial court admit it?
670	A recent law school graduate was offered a job as an aide by a state legislator. The legislator told the graduate that before she could begin working, she had to take the following loyalty oath: "I swear to uphold our state and federal Constitutions; to show respect for the state and federal flags; and to oppose the overthrow of the government by violent, illegal, or unconstitutional means." The graduate told the legislator that the oath is unconstitutional and refused to take the oath. Is the graduate correct?
671	A defendant is charged with theft of a car. On cross-examination of the defendant, the prosecution asked her whether she had been convicted of fraudulent business practices six months earlier. This question is:
672	A state statute prohibited individuals from donating more than $1,000 per year to any group that lobbies for or against any matter up for consideration before the state legislature. A voter who wanted to donate $5,000 to a lobbying group challenged the statute on constitutional grounds in federal court. Is the court likely to uphold the statute?
673	Dan was an alcoholic who frequently experienced auditory hallucinations that commanded him to engage in bizarre and sometimes violent behavior. He generally obeyed these commands. The hallucinations appeared more frequently when he was intoxicated, but he sometimes experienced them when he had not been drinking. After Dan had been drinking continuously for a three-day period, an elderly woman began to reproach him about his drunken condition, slapping him on the face and shoulders as she did so. Dan believed that he was being unmercifully attacked and heard the hallucinatory voice telling him to strangle his assailant. He did so, and the woman died. If Dan is charged with second-degree murder, Dan's best chance of acquittal would be to rely on a defense of
674	A student activist suggested to her boyfriend that they put a drug in the sugar bowls at their college cafeteria so that students would become sick and the activist's antinuclear group could claim that toxic emissions from a nearby nuclear power plant were the cause. The boyfriend told the student that people could become very ill, or even die, if they consumed too large a quantity of the drug. The student promised that they would only put a small amount of the drug in each bowl and asked the boyfriend to get the drug from his chemistry lab during his chemistry class, which he did. After class, the boyfriend gave the bottle to the student. Before the boyfriend awoke the next day, the student went to the cafeteria and put small quantities of the drug in several sugar bowls. She accidentally put a much larger amount in the sugar bowl at one table. Four persons who sat at that table became extremely ill, and one of the four eventually died. In a jurisdiction applying the common law, the boyfriend may be liable for the death of the student as:
675	Homer conveyed his home to his wife, Wanda, for life, remainder to his daughter, Dixie. There was a $20,000 mortgage on the home, requiring monthly payments covering interest to date Plus a portion of the principal. Which of the following statements about the monthly payment is correct?
676	The United States entered into a treaty with a neighboring country whereby each country agreed to ban hunting of the red-tailed raccoon, a species of raccoon indigenous to both. The raccoon had been placed on the endangered species list of conservation groups. The raccoon freely crossed the international boundary between the countries, and state lines within the United States. Laws in three states in the United States permitted hunting of the raccoon. After the treaty was fully ratified by both countries, a United States federal court would most likely hold that the state laws permitting hunting of the raccoons are:
677	Dann, who was charged with the crime of assaulting Smith, admitted striking Smith but claimed to have acted in self-defense when he was attacked by Smith, who was drunk and belligerent after a football game. On cross-examination of Employer (Dann's), the state's attorney asked Employer if he had heard that Dann often engaged in fights and brawls. The trial judge should rule the question
678	A statute in the jurisdiction, which was enacted with the express purpose of preventing public employees from taking advantage of the status of illegal aliens, made it a felony to accept money or other benefits in exchange for issuing a state identification card. During an undercover investigation, an illegal alien was recorded offering $500 to a clerk in exchange for issuance of a card. The clerk agreed to the deal and later that day exchanged the card for the money, after which both parties were arrested. In a jurisdiction following the common law approach to conspiracy, which of the following statements is correct?
679	An elderly aunt devised her land to a charity "because my nephew has been stealing from me." When the nephew, who had been caring for the aunt, discovered the will, he threatened to withdraw his care unless she conveyed the land to him. The nephew obtained a blank deed and filled in the description of the land and the parties' names. Under "consideration" he wrote, "past and future care." The aunt signed the deed and the nephew recorded it. Subsequently, the nephew sold the land for market value to a buyer who was unaware of the nephew's threat to the aunt. The buyer recorded her deed. Last month, the aunt died. If the charity brings suit to impose a constructive trust on the land, will it prevail?

681	Bye Bye telegraphed Vendor on June 1, "At what price will you sell 100 of your QT- Model garbage-disposal units for delivery around June 10?" Thereafter, the following communications were exchanged: 1. Telegram from Vendor received by Bye Bye on June 2: "You're in luck. We have only 100 QT's, all on clearance at 50% off usual wholesale of $120 per unit, for delivery at our shipping platform on June 12." 2. Letter from Bye Bye received in U.S. mail by Vendor on June 5: "I accept. Would prefer to pay in full 30 days after invoice." 3. Telegram from Vendor received by Bye Bye on June 6: "You must pick up at our platform and pay C.O.D." 4. Letter from Bye Bye received in U.S. mail by Vendor on June 9: "I don't deal with people who can't accommodate our simple requests." 5. Telegram from Bye Bye received by Vendor on June 10, after Vendor had sold and delivered all 100 of the QT's to another buyer earlier that day: "Okay. I'm over a barrel and will pick up the goods on your terms June 12." Bye Bye now sues Vendor for breach of contract. Which of the following arguments will best serve Vendor's defense?
682	Dunbar and Balcom went into a drugstore, where Dunbar reached into the cash register and took out $200. Stone, the owner of the store, came out of a back room, saw what had happened, and told Dunbar to put the money back. Balcom then took a revolver from under his coat and shot and killed Stone. If Dunbar is prosecuted for murder on the basis of being an accessory to Balcom in committing a murder and the jury believes her claim, she should be found
683	An act of Congress provides for the payment of Social Security benefits to the disabled children of deceased workers. The benefits are payable even after the child reaches the age of majority, but terminate automatically if the recipient marries, unless the recipient marries a person who is also disabled, in which case the Social Security payments continue. The plaintiff has been disabled since birth, and her father died when she was 14 years of age. She has received Social Security benefits since her father's death. However, at age 25, the plaintiff married. Her husband is not disabled, and thus her Social Security benefits were summarily terminated. She files suit in federal district court, seeking to compel the government to restore her benefits. She asserts, among other things, that there is no logical reason why she should be deprived of benefits when unmarried disabled persons and disabled persons who marry other disabled persons continue to receive them. Which of the following provides the strongest constitutional basis for the plaintiff's suit?
684	A plumbing contractor sued a homeowner, alleging that the homeowner refused to pay for extensive pipe repairs performed on her home by an employee of the contractor. The contractor called the employee to the stand as a witness. The employee, under oath, testified that he did not perform any work at the homeowner's home. The employee also denied writing a letter to a friend telling the friend that he was going to do plumbing work on the homeowner's house. Without releasing the employee as a witness, the contractor offers in evidence the letter written by the employee to his friend. Which of the following is not a proper basis for admitting the employee's letter?
685	Re-direct examination of a witness must be permitted in which of the following circumstances?
686	A builder learned of a bid being let by the local school board for a new high school. Anxious to get the job, the builder immediately advertised for sub-bids. The lowest sub-bid came from a local contractor. It was for $160,000, which was $40,000 less than the next lowest sub-bid. The builder submitted its general bid to the school board after computing it based, in part, on the lowest sub-bid. The builder's general bid was $30,000 lower than the school board had originally anticipated. Pleasantly surprised by the low bid, the school board accepted. After the acceptance, the contractor who had submitted the lowest sub-bid informed the builder that there had been a mistake in computing the sub-bid. The correct sub-bid was $210,000. The builder had been unaware of this mistake. In a suit for rescission of its contract with the builder, the contractor should:
687	Large semi-trailer trucks use one of two basic designs of tires. There are some differences in the two designs of the tires, but both are deemed to be equally safe by independent testing labs. A state has enacted a statute banning the use of one of the tire types. The other tire design is legal and available for sale in all states. A trade association of interstate trucking firms has brought suit to have the statute declared unconstitutional. The state argues that no burden exists because the other tire design can be used in all states. How should the Court rule on the constitutionality of the statute?
688	Prine sued Dover for an assault that occurred March 5 in California. To support his defense that he was in Utah on that date, Dover identifies and seeks to introduce a letter he wrote to his sister a week before the assault in which he stated that he would see her in Utah on March 5. The letter is
689	Two teenagers who had recently gotten their driver's licenses agreed to a game of "chicken," with the one who turned his car away first having to pay the other $25. The two cars raced toward each other, and when they were about 40 feet apart, the victim suddenly turned his car to the right, but the defendant was going too fast to avoid the victim's car. He crashed into the side of the victim's car, killing the victim instantly. The homicide statute in this jurisdiction reads in part as follows: "Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought. Such malice may be express or implied. It is express when there is manifested a deliberate intention to unlawfully take away the life of a fellow creature. It is implied when no considerable provocation appears or when the circumstances attending the killing show an abandoned and malignant heart. All murder that is perpetrated by willful, deliberate, or premeditated killing or committed in the perpetration of or attempt to perpetrate arson, rape, robbery, or burglary is murder of the first degree. All other kinds of murders are of the second degree." If the defendant is charged with first degree murder, his most effective defense is:
690	A defendant is charged with the arson of a house. At trial, the prosecution offers evidence that when the defendant was arrested, shortly after the crime had been committed, she had a large amount of cocaine hidden in the trunk of her car. This evidence should be:
691	The federal government recently constructed a radio telescope in Puerto Rico. In addition to receiving radio signals, the telescope was set up to beam radio waves far out into space. As part of the bill providing for operational funding for the facility, Congress provided for a program to "inform any aliens who might be listening in outer space of the 'American Way of Religion."' A $10 million appropriation was provided; any religious group whose membership exceeded 500 members in the United States was permitted to prepare a five-minute presentation, and the federal government would pay for the recording of the presentations and broadcast them into space using the transmitter in Puerto Rico. The President signed the bill and it became law. A religious group with a large following in Europe, but only 100 members in the United States, protested and filed suit. Will the court find the religious broadcasts to be constitutional?
692	A statute requires that any pilot who flies passengers for hire must have a commercial pilot's license. An experienced pilot who had only a private pilot's license and not the commercial license required by statute was asked by an attorney to fly her to another city to close a deal. The attorney knew that the pilot did not have a commercial license but the only commercial flight to the city was at an inconvenient time. The pilot flew the attorney through bad weather and landed safely, but because of a minor navigational error he landed at an airport a few miles away from the airport he was heading for. As he was going to start taxiing toward the hangar, another plane struck the aircraft. The student pilot of that plane had ignored the control tower's instructions and gone onto the landing runway instead of the takeoff runway. The attorney was injured in the collision. If the attorney sues the pilot for her injuries, who will prevail?
693	Congressional legislation authorizing marriages and divorces as a matter of federal law on prescribed terms and conditions could most easily be upheld if it
694	Owen owned Greenacre, a tract of land, in fee simple. By warranty deed he conveyed Greenacre to Lafe for life "and from and after the death of Lafe to Rem, her heirs and assigns." Subsequently Rem died, devising all of her estate to Dan. Rem was survived by Hannah, her sole heir-at-law. Shortly thereafter Lafe died, survived by Owen, Dan, and Hannah. Title to Greenacre now is in
695	Buyer, Inc., contracted in writing with Shareholder, who owned all of XYZ Corporation's outstanding stock, to purchase all of her stock at a specified price per share. At the time this contract was executed, Buyer's contracting officer said to Shareholder, "Of course, our commitment to buy is conditioned on our obtaining approval of the contract from Conglomerate, Ltd., our parent company." Shareholder replied, "Fine. No problem." For this question only, assume the following facts. Shareholder is willing and ready to consummate the sale of her stock to Buyer, but the latter refuses to perform on the ground (which is true) that Conglomerate has firmly refused to approve the contract. If Shareholder sues Buyer for breach of contract and seeks to exclude any evidence of the oral condition requiring Conglomerate's approval, the court will probably
696	Two neighbors owned summer homes adjacent to each other on the lake. After a week-long stay by the son of one of the property owners, the neighbor called the owner and said that his boat dock had been badly damaged and was told by another resident that the owner's son and some friends had gotten drunk and accidentally crashed their boat into his dock. The owner was surprised at the accusation because he was sure that if his son had caused the damages, he would have told him. However, he did not want to get into a dispute with his neighbor, so he told his neighbor that he would have the dock repaired and pay for the repairs if the neighbor agreed not to bring a claim against his son for the damage to the dock. The neighbor agreed, and the owner hired a local carpenter to do the work. Later, however, the owner discovered that his son did not damage the dock because the damages occurred after his son had returned to college. Is the owner obligated to pay for the repairs?
697	A defendant is charged with having been one of two men who robbed a bar and its patrons at gunpoint at 5:30 p.m. on December 16. The defendant calls a witness in his defense who testifies that she drove to the defendant's home at 10 a.m. on December 16 and picked up the defendant and his wife, then took them to a birthday party that lasted until 7 p.m. The prosecutor asks on cross-examination, "What is your relationship to the defendant's wife?" Defense counsel objects. How should the court rule?
698	A defendant lost some money while playing poker with several people at his friend's house. When the defendant accused his friend of cheating, his friend asked him to leave. The defendant became abusive and refused to leave, so his friend and a couple of other players forced him to go. Angry and determined to get back his money, the defendant went to his home and picked up his pistol. He headed back to his friend's house, intending to shoot his friend if he did not give back the money. However, due to the altercation at the house, his friend had called the police. Just as the defendant was about to step onto his friend's property, the police pulled up and stopped him. They frisked him, found the pistol in his pocket, and arrested him. A state statute prohibits entry onto the property of another with the intent to commit violence thereon. If charged with attempt under this statute, most likely the defendant will be found:
699	In response to a tremendous increase in begging in the downtown area of a city, the city council enacted an ordinance that required anyone soliciting for charitable contributions of any sort in any public place to wear an identity card issued by the local police department. Identity cards could be obtained by completing an affidavit providing the applicant's identification and address information and further affirming that the applicant was not soliciting for personal use and belonged to a recognized charitable organization. A member of an anti-tobacco charitable organization wishes to solicit contributions by similarly minded persons for use in his organization's campaign against public smoking. He does not want to comply with the identity card ordinance. He comes to you for legal advice and asks whether he should challenge the ordinance in federal court. You should advise that the ordinance is probably:
700	Mater, a wealthy widow, wishing to make a substantial and potentially enduring gift to her beloved adult stepson Prodigal, established with Vault Savings and Loan Association a passbook savings account by an initial deposit of $10,000. For this question only, assume the following facts. The passbook was issued by Vault to Mater solely in her own name. That same day, disinterested witnesses being present, she handed the passbook to Prodigal and said, "As a token of my love and affection for you, I give you this $10,000 savings account." Shortly thereafter, she changed her mind and wrote Prodigal, "I hereby revoke my gift to you of the $10,000 savings account with Vault Savings and Loan Association. Please return my passbook immediately. Signed: Mater." Prodigal received the letter but ignored it, and Mater died unexpectedly a few days later. In litigation between Prodigal and Mater's estate, which of the following is a correct statement of the parties' rights with respect to the money on deposit with Vault?
701	Pursuant to an edict recently issued by the elders of their religion, a mother and father instructed their son who just turned age 14 to report to a community woodworking shop instead of school. A state law requires all children to attend school until the age of 16, and the woodshop does not qualify as a school under state law. Because the parents did not report their son's absence, a truant officer visited the family and warned them that parents who willfully refuse to comply with the mandatory attendance law are subject to a $500 fine and up to 30 days in jail for each day of noncompliance. The parents listened, but informed the officer that they could not comply with the state law because of their religious views. The following day, the 14-year-old again went to work in the community woodshop instead of to school. His parents were then arrested and charged with violating the state mandatory school attendance law. At the parents' criminal trial, which of the following may the court constitutionally consider in determining guilt or innocence?
702	An entrepreneur purchased several acres of scrub-covered land of little apparent value. Shortly thereafter, an international conglomerate announced plans to develop a theme park on a tract immediately adjacent to the entrepreneur's scrubland. The plan caused real estate values in the surrounding area to skyrocket. Rather than resell his land for a substantial profit, the entrepreneur decided to build a variety of touristoriented facilities on the land. To finance his project, the entrepreneur obtained a loan from a bank in exchange for a $20,000 mortgage on his land. The bank promptly recorded the mortgage. A few days later, the entrepreneur went to a credit union and took out a $15,000 mortgage on the land. The credit union knew of the bank's mortgage, and the credit union promptly recorded its own mortgage. A few weeks after that, the entrepreneur went back to the bank and, after full disclosure of the credit union's mortgage, obtained another advance of $15,000 from the original bank mortgage, increasing the amount borrowed against the mortgage from $20,000 to $35,000. The bank promptly recorded the change. After spending much of these funds on retainers for architects, builders, and attorneys, the entrepreneur was upset to learn that the county council summarily rejected the theme park proposal. The entrepreneur made no more mortgage payments to the credit union, but continued to make payments to the bank. The credit union brought a foreclosure action against the entrepreneur and included the bank as a party. The value of the land in the area had plummeted, so the proceeds at the foreclosure sale were just $18,000 after attorneys' fees and court costs. How should the proceeds be divided?
703	A landowner owned a large tract of undeveloped land in fee simple. Although no excavation had been done on the land, it was believed to contain gold. The landowner therefore began to mine the land, financing his operation with a $100,000 mortgage to a bank. Subsequently, the landowner sold all of the interest in gold on the land to a miner. Shortly thereafter, the landowner conveyed his ownership in the land to a mining company. Realizing that none of their interests had been recorded, the bank recorded its mortgage first, the miner recorded her deed second, and the mining company recorded its deed third. None of the parties dealing with the landowner had any knowledge of the others at the time of their transactions. The jurisdiction in which the land is located has the following statute: "No conveyance or mortgage of an interest in land is valid against any subsequent purchaser for value without notice thereof, unless it is recorded." If the mining company brings an action to quiet title in the land, the most likely result is:
704	A leading manufacturer of camping products marketed a thermal blanket that incorporated new heat-generating technology. On the blanket's packaging was a label stating that it was recommended by a leading camping association. A camper purchased one of the blankets and took it with her on a fall camping trip. The first night that she used the blanket, it malfunctioned and caused her severe burns. If the camper maintains an action against the camping association, on which theory is she most likely to recover, if at all?
705	A bicycle manufacturer manufactured a bicycle that it sold to a retail dealer. The bicycle had a serious manufacturing defect in its brakes, but the dealer did not discover the defect before putting it on the sales floor despite a careful inspection of the bicycle. The retail dealer sold the bicycle to a bicycle messenger. Shortly thereafter, while the messenger was riding the bicycle along a busy city street, he saw a traffic light facing him turn from green to yellow. He sped up, hoping to cross the intersection before the light turned red. However, the messenger quickly realized that he could not do so and applied the brake, which failed and caused him to crash. The messenger sustained injuries. Assume that the jurisdiction follows traditional contributory negligence rules. If the messenger asserts a claim against the retail dealer based on strict liability in tort, will the messenger prevail?
706	The manager of the shoe department of a large department store noticed that mukluks were flying off the shelf in anticipation of another exceptionally cold winter, and he realized that he needed to order more. On November 1, the manager phoned a local manufacturer of mukluks and placed an order for 100 pairs, at a cost of $90 a pair, the price listed in the manufacturer's catalogue, which the manager had consulted before placing his order. Two days later, the manufacturer mailed the manager a letter stating that the mukluks were now $105 a pair and that they would be shipped to him on November 17. The manager received the letter on November 5, but he never responded. On November 17, the manufacturer shipped the mukluks to the department store, but it was not a perfect tender, and the manager filed suit for breach of contract. Assuming that the parties' communications were sufficient to form a contract, on what day was the contract formed?
707	A man and a woman lived together for many years, but never married. The state in which they lived did not recognize common law marriages. One day, the man went with the woman to his bank and showed her a deed to a hotel he owned. The deed was properly executed and named the woman as grantee. The man handed the deed back to the banker, stating, "When I die you are to give the deed to her." The banker accepted the deed, and assured the woman that he would handle everything. A few months later, the man and the woman had a violent quarrel. The man prevailed on the banker to return the deed. In a suit by the woman against the man to establish her claim to an interest in the hotel:
708	The owner of a collection of old anvils lent it to the local museum and hired professional movers to transport the anvils to the second floor of the museum, where they would be displayed. The movers used a rope and pulley apparatus to lift the anvils on the outside of the building to a second-story window. While one of the largest anvils was being lifted, it slipped and fell, crashing to the ground. However, the anvil was not even dented. If the owner brings a negligence action against the movers for allowing the antique anvil to fall, he can recover:
709	A state enacted a law banning the use within the state of computerized telephone solicitation devices, and requiring that all telephone solicitation calls within the state to in-state numbers be dialed by human beings. Federal legislation and administrative regulations control only the rates to be charged for telephone calls. The legislation is:
710	A truck driver is suing a car driver for injuries he suffered when their vehicles collided at an intersection controlled by stoplights. The truck driver called a witness to the accident to testify that he saw the driver of the car drive through a red light. On cross-examination, the car driver's attorney asks the witness, "Isn't it true that the car driver's ex-wife is paying $500 for your testimony today?" The truck driver's attorney objects. The objection should be:
711	A state's constitution authorizes a state reapportionment board to redraw state legislative districts every 12 years. During the most recent reapportionment process, consultants had provided the board with two alternative plans for reapportionment. One plan provided for districts with less than a 3% difference in proportional representation between districts. The other plan was drawn up to conform state legislative districts as nearly as possible to county borders, resulting in differences in proportional representation between districts of up to 12%. The current apportionment of legislative districts results in differences of up to 15% between districts. The board ultimately selected the reapportionment plan based on county borders, and this plan was approved by the state legislature. A Caucasian resident and registered voter of the state brought a constitutional challenge to the reapportionment in federal court. His claim is based on the fact that, as a result of the plan that the board selected, the percentage of the African-American voting population in the district in which he lives increased from 45% to 55%. Had the other plan been selected, the percentage would have been unchanged in his district. In the absence of a federal statute applicable to the state, is the resident likely to prevail?
712	A woman went to her local department store and told the salesperson that she wanted a coat that was extremely warm. The salesperson went into his stockroom and brought out four different styles of very warm coats. The woman tried on each of the four but did not like the way any of them looked. While walking around the store, however, the young woman saw a coat she did like and told the salesperson to bring one in her size. The salesperson brought her the coat and he said that it was made of the finest cashmere and would probably last for years. The young woman tried on the coat and told the salesperson that she would take it and paid him. After wearing the coat twice, however, she decided it was not warm enough for her climate. She took the coat back to the department store and demanded her money back. The store refused. If the woman sues to get her money back, under which theory would she most likely prevail?
713	While in a department store, a man picked up a sweater and slipped it under his shirt. The man then started for the door. A woman, who also was shopping in the store, saw the man take the sweater. The woman grabbed a baseball bat from the sporting goods aisle and chased the man into the parking lot. The woman began swinging the bat at the man's head, hoping to knock him out and thus prevent the theft. The man pulled a knife from his pocket and stabbed the woman, killing her. The man was arrested and charged with murder. At trial, the man will most likely be found:
714	A resident living near a factory brought a private nuisance action against the factory, alleging that emissions from the factory's smokestack were aggravating her sinus condition and interfering with the use and enjoyment of her property. What is the most relevant factor in the factory's defense of the lawsuit?
715	Rachel, an antique dealer and a skilled calligrapher, crafted a letter on very old paper. She included details that would lead knowledgeable readers to believe the letter had been written by Thomas Jefferson to a friend. Rachel, who had a facsimile of Jefferson's autograph, made the signature and other writing on the letter resemble Jefferson's. She knew that the letter would attract the attention of local collectors. When it did and she was contacted about selling it, she said that it had come into her hands from a foreign collector who wished anonymity, and that she could make no promises about its authenticity. As she had hoped, a collector paid her $5,000 for the letter. Later the collector discovered the letter was not authentic, and handwriting analysis established that Rachel had written the letter. In a jurisdiction that follows the common-law definition of forgery, Rachel has
716	Public schools in the state of Green are financed, in large part, by revenue derived from real estate taxes imposed by each school district on the taxable real property located in that district. Public schools also receive other revenue from private gifts, federal grants, student fees, and local sales taxes. For many years, Green has distributed additional funds, which come from the state treasury, to local school districts in order to equalize the funds available on a per-student basis for each public school district. These additional funds are distributed on the basis of a state statutory formula that considers only the number of students in each public school district and the real estate tax revenue raised by that district. The formula does not consider other revenue received by a school district from different sources. The school boards of two school districts, together with parents and schoolchildren in those districts, bring suit in federal court to enjoin the state from allocating the additional funds from the state treasury to individual districts pursuant to this formula. They allege that the failure of the state, in allocating this additional money, to take into account a school district's sources of revenue other than revenue derived from taxes levied on real estate located there violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The complaint does not allege that the allocation of the additional state funds based on the current statutory formula has resulted in a failure to provide minimally adequate education to any child. Which of the following best describes the appropriate standard by which the court should review the constitutionality of the state statutory funding formula?
717	An artist purchased a warehouse in an industrial district that she converted into a studio many years ago. A few months ago, a record company purchased a warehouse next door to the artist's studio and converted it into a recording studio and rehearsal rooms. The recording studio frequently stays open long past midnight, particularly on the weekends. Although the five recording studios are thoroughly soundproofed, the various rehearsal rooms are not. When bands are using them, the sound can easily be heard by the artist when she is working in her studio. The artist had always done her work at night, but since the recording studio next door opened, she has found it very difficult to concentrate on her work. She is distracted by all the noise and activity from the recording studio. In a private nuisance suit against the record company, the fact that the artist owns her studio and has used it for 15 years is:
718	Janet had a season ticket for the Scorpions' hockey games at Central Arena (Section B, Row 12, Seat 16). During the intermission between the first and second periods of a game between the Scorpions and the visiting Hornets, Janet solicited signatures for a petition urging that the coach of the Scorpions be fired. Central Arena and the Scorpions are owned by ABC, Inc., a privately owned entity. As evidenced by many prominently displayed signs, ABC prohibits all solicitations anywhere within Central Arena at any time and in any manner. ABC notified Janet to cease her solicitation of signatures. Janet continued to seek signatures on her petition during the Scorpions' next three home games at Central Arena. Each time, ABC notified Janet to cease such solicitation. Janet announced her intention to seek signatures on her petition again during the Scorpions' next home game at Central Arena. ABC wrote a letter informing Janet that her season ticket was canceled and tendering a refund for the unused portion. Janet refused the tender and brought an appropriate action to establish the right to attend all home games. In this action, the court will decide for
719	The owner of a large screen television agreed to sell it for $2,500. The buyer made a down payment of $700, took possession of the television and agreed to pay the outstanding balance in 18 equal $100 installments, beginning on June 5, with subsequent installments due on the fifth of each month until the balance was paid in full The buyer's friend owed her $2,000. On May 20, the buyer and her friend entered into an oral agreement whereby the friend agreed to make the 18 $100 installment payments to the seller in exchange for the buyer's promise to forgive the friend's $2,000 debt. On June 7, the seller called the buyer to ask her where his first $100 installment payment was, and she told him at that time of her agreement with her friend. The friend has made none of the installment payments. If the seller files suit against the friend demanding payment, who will prevail?
720	To ease the desperate plight of the thousands of auto workers suffering layoffs, plant closures, and pay cuts from lost sales to foreign competitors, a state legislature enacted an excise tax on any automobile sold in the state that had not been manufactured within the state. The tax was graduated from 5% of the sales price of inexpensive automobiles down to 1% for automobiles selling for more than $100,000. A corporation that manufactures automobiles in a neighboring state brought an appropriate action in federal court to enjoin enforcement of the automobile tax statute as to its products. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument supporting the invalidity of the special tax?
721	At a party, Diane and Victor agreed to play a game they called "spin the barrel." Victor took an unloaded revolver, placed one bullet in the barrel, and spun the barrel. Victor then pointed the gun at Diane's head and pulled the trigger once. The gun did not fire. Diane then took the gun, pointed it at Victor, spun the barrel, and pulled the trigger once. The gun fired, and Victor fell over dead. A statute in the jurisdiction defines murder in the first degree as an intentional and premeditated killing or one occurring during the commission of a common-law felony, and murder in the second degree as all other murder at common law. Manslaughter is defined as a killing in the heat of passion upon an adequate legal provocation or a killing caused by gross negligence. The most serious crime for which Diane can properly be convicted is
722	While negligently driving his father's uninsured automobile, 25-year-old Arthur crashed into an automobile driven by Betty. Both Arthur and Betty were injured. Charles, Arthur's father, erroneously believing that he was liable because he owned the automobile, said to Betty: "I will see to it that you are reimbursed for any losses you incur as a result of the accident." Charles also called Physician and told him to take care of Betty, and that he, Charles, would pay the bill. Arthur, having no assets, died as a result of his injuries. Dodge, one of Arthur's creditors, wrote to Charles stating that Arthur owed him a clothing bill of $200 and that he was going to file a claim against Arthur's estate. Charles replied: "If you don't file a claim against Arthur's estate, I will pay what he owed you." If Dodge did not file an action against Arthur's estate, would Dodge succeed in an action against Charles for $200 ?
723	A nonunion carpenter went to work on a construction project that was involved in a labor dispute. Every morning when he arrived at work, he would be accosted by the picketers who would try to persuade him not to continue to work. One morning while the carpenter was trying to get to work, one of the union workers stopped him at the gate and told him that he should not go to work. When the carpenter insisted that the striker get out of the way, the striker said, "Try to make me, scab!" The carpenter, intending to frighten the striker, swung his hammer at him. The head on the hammer, however, was defective and it flew off, hitting the striker in the face. If the striker sues the carpenter for battery, most likely he will:
724	A farmer who wanted to sell his rye before the growing season was over sent the following fax to a local baker: "Will sell my unprocessed rye, 20 bushels maximum, best price $100 per bushel, firm for 48 hours. /s/ Farmer." Unsure how the baker would respond, and anxious to find a buyer for the rye, the farmer made the same offer to the baker's chief competitor by fax later that same day. The baker was delighted to receive the offer, but needed a day or so to figure out how much rye she needed. When she accepted the farmer's offer the next day, faxing to him an order for 20 bushels, she was aware of the farmer's offer to her competitor, and that her competitor had faxed an order to the farmer for 20 bushels. Unbeknownst to the baker, the farmer does not have enough rye in his fields to sell 20 bushels to each party. The jurisdiction's Uniform Commercial Code includes farmers within the definition of "merchants." Upon receipt of the baker's order, the farmer has which of the following obligations?
725	The defendant, angered because a rival gang member had twice beaten him up after school, obtained a heavy lead pipe and waited in a deserted alleyway which he knew the rival took as a route home every day after school. When his enemy came walking down the alley, the defendant leapt out behind him and smashed the pipe into the victim's head, knocking him to the ground. The defendant then rolled the victim over and pounded his face with 15 to 20 heavy blows with the lead pipe, killing him. The jurisdiction defines first degree murder as murder committed with premeditation and deliberation. All other murders are defined as second degree murders. If the defendant is convicted of first degree murder (as opposed to second degree murder), it will be because:
726	On January 2, Hugh Homey and Sue Structo entered into a written contract in which Structo agreed to build on Homey's lot a new house for Homey, according to plans and specifications furnished by Homey's architect, Barbara Bilevel, at a contract price of $200,000. The contract provided for specified progress payments and a final payment of $40,000 upon Homey's acceptance of the house and issuance of a certificate of final approval by the architect. Further, under a "liquidated damages" clause in the agreement, Structo promised to pay Homey $500 for each day's delay in completing the house after the following October 1. Homey, however, told Structo on January 2, before the contract was signed, that he would be on an around-the-world vacation trip most of the summer and fall and would not return to occupy the house until November 1. For this question only, assume the following facts. Structo completed the house on October 14 and, when Homey returned on November 1, requested the final payment of $40,000 and issuance of a certificate of final approval by the architect, Bilevel. Homey, however, refused to pay any part of the final installment after Bilevel told him, "Structo did a great job and I find no defects worth mentioning; but Structo's contract price was at least $40,000 too high, especially in view of the big drop in housing values within the past ten months. I will withhold the final certificate, and you just hold on to your money." If Structo sues Homey for the $40,000 final payment after Bilevel's refusal to issue a final certificate, which of the following will the court probably decide?
727	A farmer executed a valid deed, conveying his orange grove: To my brother for life, then to my niece and nephew. My brother shall have no right to convey any interest in the orange grove. Likewise, should my niece or nephew attempt to convey any interest in the orange grove prior to the date that their interest becomes possessory, that niece's or nephew's interest shall pass to the other. Subsequently, the brother transferred all of his interest in the orange grove to his friend. Several weeks after the brother's conveyance, the nephew found himself in need of cash and conveyed his interest in the orange grove to a loan shark in exchange for $20,000. The niece brings a suit to quiet title to the orange grove. Who will the court find has title to the orange grove?
728	A lessee leased some land from a lessor for a period of 10 years. Five years later, the state took title to the land under proper eminent domain proceedings. Which of the following statements is correct concerning the rights of the lessee?
729	In litigation on a federal claim, Plaintiff had the burden of proving that Defendant received a notice. Plaintiff relied on the presumption of receipt by offering evidence that the notice was addressed to Defendant, properly stamped, and mailed. Defendant, on the other hand, testified that she never received the notice. Which of the following is correct?
730	A plaintiff filed a trademark infringement suit against a defendant company. While the defendant's director of marketing was on the stand, the defendant's attorney produced a "product recognition survey," a document generated by the defendant's marketing division. The plaintiff's attorney objects that the record is hearsay. The defendant's attorney responds that it is a business record admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule. The plaintiff's attorney counters that the document was prepared for this litigation and not made in the ordinary course of business. The plaintiff's attorney demands a hearing to determine whether the document qualifies as a business record. Which of the following is the most appropriate way for the issue to be decided?
731	A buyer entered into a contract with a seller to buy a parcel of land for $40,000. Although the buyer was expecting to receive a large inheritance in a few weeks, he had very limited funds on hand and was able to personally finance only $10,000. To cover the remaining balance, the buyer obtained a loan from the seller for $30,000, giving the seller a nonnegotiable promissory note in that amount secured by a mortgage on the land and orally promising to pay the seller in full when he received his inheritance money. A few weeks later, the seller transferred possession of the mortgage note to an investor for $25,000 without informing the buyer. The next day, the seller received a check from the buyer in the amount of $30,000. A few days later, the seller left the country with the $65,000 she had made on the sale of the land. Which of the following correctly states the investor's rights against the buyer?
732	For a number of years, a leasing company has been in charge of leasing the luxury skyboxes at a local basketball stadium. During this time, it annually sent area businesses personalized "invitations" to lease skyboxes for the season. The invitations, which were always sent out several months before each season began, contained detailed price terms and language stating that the deadline for responding was 10 weeks before the start of the season and that all leases were subject to the approval of the management of the leasing company. A local advertising agency had always responded to their invitation immediately by registered mail because they found it very worthwhile to lease a skybox to entertain their clients. During the five years that they had responded affirmatively to the invitation, they never received any additional communications from the leasing company regarding approval, but the tickets and an invoice would arrive about a week before the season began. Several months before the current season, the advertising agency received and immediately responded to its invitation. Two weeks before the season began, a stunning trade brought the league's most popular star to the city's basketball team, prompting a dramatic increase in the demand for tickets. A few days later, the advertising agency, which had already scheduled in a number of clients to attend games in its skybox, received a notice from the leasing company stating that management had not approved the agency's lease of the skybox for this season. In a separate announcement to all area businesses, the leasing company announced that all available skyboxes would be leased for three- or five-year terms, and that an auction of the leases would be conducted if the demand exceeded the supply. The advertising agency decided that it was not financially feasible to commit itself to anything longer than a one-year lease. It sent a letter to the leasing company, stating that a contract was created between the parties and that the leasing company will be in breach if it does not perform. Is the advertising agency correct in its assertions?
733	The State of Missoula has enacted a new election code designed to increase voter responsibility in the exercise of the franchise and to enlarge citizen participation in the electoral process. None of its provisions conflicts with federal statutes. The Missoula election code provides that in a special-purpose election for directors ofa state watershed improvement district, the franchise is limited to landowners within the district, because they are the only ones directly affected by the outcome. Each vote is weighted according to the proportion of the holding of that individual in relation to the total affected property. The best argument in support of the statute and against the application of the "one man, one vote" principle in this situation is that the principle
734	A state enacted a statute to regulate the use of independent contractors in the state by major garment makers, most of whom were headquartered out of state, because it had led to the hiring of illegal aliens to work under conditions reminiscent of 19th-century sweatshops. The statute provides that any garment-making subcontractor must have been a citizen of the United States for five years and a resident of the state for one year. This clause of the legislation is subject to a constitutional challenge based on:
735	An investor owned a parcel of land subject to a covenant prohibiting construction of a two-story residence in order to protect the view from the neighbor's adjoining lot. The investor's parcel was also benefited by an easement in a driveway that ran over the adjoining lot to the investor's property. Fifteen years ago, a trespasser entered the investor's land and constructed a two-story residence. The trespasser also used the driveway over the adjoining lot to access the residence. Last month, the neighbor sold his lot to a buyer by a deed containing the covenant but omitting the easement. The buyer contacted her lawyer regarding her right to recover damages for the obstructed view caused by the two-story residence and to prohibit the trespasser from using the driveway. The period of time necessary to establish title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is 10 years. What should the lawyer tell the buyer concerning the enforceability of the covenant and the trespasser's right to use the driveway?
736	A retailer and a wholesaler entered into an agreement under which the retailer would make payment to one of the wholesaler's creditors. Before the creditor became aware of the agreement, the retailer and wholesaler decided instead that the retailer would pay the wholesaler directly. The creditor sued to enforce the original agreement between the retailer and the wholesaler. Which of the following statements is correct?
737	The plaintiff filed a personal injury action against a restaurant. The plaintiff alleges that she suffered food poisoning after consuming the restaurant's daily special-extra-strong coffee and chili over eggs. The restaurant defends by claiming that the special on the day in question was an exotic tea served with a yogurt and fruit blend and that the extra-strong coffee drink was not even on the menu that day. Counsel for the restaurant called a former waitress to testify as to whether the extra-strong coffee drink was on the menu that day. The former waitress, who lives with the plaintiff, testified that it was always on the menu. The restaurant's attorney then asked, "Didn't you in fact, at your deposition, state that the extra-strong coffee drink was not on the menu that day?" The plaintiff's attorney objects. The question is:
738	Ellis, an electrical engineer, designed an electronic game known as Zappo. Ellis entered into a licensing agreement with Toyco under which Toyco agreed to manufacture Zappo according to Ellis' specifications and to market it and pay a royalty to Ellis. Carla, whose parents had purchased a Zappo game for her, was injured while playing with the game. Carla recovered a judgment against Toyco on the basis of a finding that the Zappo game was defective because of Ellis' improper design. In a claim for indemnity against Ellis, will Toyco prevail?
739	A political activist, stopped while driving his car by a police officer in a patrol car, believed that the officer had stopped him solely because a large sign painted on the side of his vehicle proclaimed him a member of a controversial political organization. When additional police units arrived at the scene, the activist was convinced it was a setup. Although unarmed and slightly built, the activist swung his fist at the original officer. Another officer, seeing this, drew his revolver and shot the activist in the stomach. The activist then seized the revolver of the officer he had punched and shot at the second officer, missing him and killing an onlooker. At the activist's murder trial, his expert witness, who was not contradicted at trial, testified that the activist was rendered unconscious by being shot in the stomach. In the absence of a felony murder or misdemeanor manslaughter rule, the most serious crime for which the activist can be convicted if the jury accepts the expert's testimony is:
740	In a contract suit by the plaintiff against the defendant, the plaintiff offers into evidence a document purporting to have the defendant's signature. Which of the following will the court not accept as a method of authenticating the defendant's signature?
741	Len owned two adjoining parcels known as Lot 1 and Lot 2. Both parcels fronted on Main Street and abutted a public alley in the rear. Lot 1 was improved with a commercial building that covered all of the Main Street frontage of Lot 1; there was a large parking lot on the rear of Lot 1 with access from the alley only. Fifteen years ago, Len leased Lot 1 to Tenny for 15 years. Tenny has continuously occupied Lot 1 since that time. Thirteen years ago, without Len's permission, Tenny began to use a driveway on Lot 2 as a better access between Main Street and the parking lot than the alley. Eight years ago, Len conveyed Lot 2 to Owen and, five years ago, Len conveyed Lot 1 to Tenny by a deed that recited "together with all the appurtenances." Until last week, Tenny continuously used the driveway over Lot 2 to Tenny's parking lot in the rear of Lot 1. Last week Owen commenced construction of a building on Lot 2 and blocked the driveway used by Tenny. Tenny has commenced an action against Owen to restrain him from blocking the driveway from Main Street to the parking lot at the rear of Lot 1. The period of time to acquire rights by prescription in the jurisdiction is ten years. If Tenny loses, it will be because
742	On November 1 the following notice was posted in a privately operated law school The faculty, seeking to encourage legal xesearch, offers to any student at this school who wins the current National Obscenity Law Competition the additional prize of $500. All competing papers must be submitted to the Dean's office before next May 1. (The National Competition is conducted by an outside agency, unconnected with any law school.) Student read this notice on November 2, and thereupon intensified his effort to make his paper on obscenity law, which he started in October, a winner. Student also left on a counter in the Dean's office a signed note saying, "I accept the faculty's $500 Obscenity Competition offer." This note was madvertently placed in Student's file and never reached the Dean or any faculty member personally. On the following April 1, the above notice was removed and the following substituted therefor: The faculty regrets that our offer regarding the National Obscenity Law Competition must be withdrawn. Student's paper was submitted through the Dean's office on April 15. On May 1, it was announced that Student had won the National Obscenity Law Competition and the prize of $1,000. The law faculty refused to pay anything. The offer proposed a

Subsequently, Rose was indicted by a federal grand jury for conspiracy to distribute the same kilogram of heroin. She moved to dismiss the indictment. Her motion should be
744	in 1930, Owens, the owner in fee simple of Barrenacres, a large, undeveloped tract of land, granted an easement to the Water District "to install, inspect, repair, maintain, and replace pipes" within a properly delineated strip of land twenty feet wide across Barrenacres. The easement permitted the Water District to enter Barrenacres for only the stated purposes. The Water District promptly and properly recorded the deed. In 1931, the Water District installed a water main which crossed Barrenacres within the described strip: the Water District has not since entered Barrenacres. In 1935, Owens sold Barrenacres to Peterson, but the deed, which was promptly and properly recorded, failed to refer to the Water District easement. Peterson built his home on Barrenacres in 1935, and since that time he has planted and maintained, at great expense in money, time, and effort, a formal garden area which covers, among other areas, the surfac- of the twenty-foot easement strip. In 1976, the Water District proposed to excavate the entire length of its main in order to inspect, repair, and replace the main, to the extent necessary. At a public meeting, at which Peterson was present, the Water District announced its plans and declared its intent to do as little damage as possible to any property involved. Peterson objected to the Water District plans. Peterson asked his attorney to secure an injunction against the Water District and its proposed entry upon his property. The best advice that the attorney can give is that Peterson's attempt to secure injunctive relief will be likely to
745	A con artist asked his friend to introduce him to the town's banker so that he could apply for a loan to set up a hardware business. The friend, also a friend of the banker, arranged a meeting and later gave the con artist a glowing recommendation based on their long and deep friendship. When the banker approved a $25,000 loan, the friend was present at the signing of the loan papers and co-signed on the con artist's behalf. Unbeknownst to the friend, the con artist intentionally misrepresented his intentions as to the proceeds of the loan and his financial status, forging some documents used to verify his solvency. The con artist has been tried and convicted of obtaining money by false pretenses (a felony) and sentenced to state prison. If the friend is charged as an accessory to obtaining money by false pretenses, he should be found:
746	Telco, a local telephone company, negligently allowed one of its telephone poles, located between a street and a sidewalk, to become termite-ridden. Rhodes, who was intoxicated and driving at an excessive rate of speed, lost control of her car and hit the weakened telephone pole. One week later, the pole fell and struck Walker, a pedestrian who was walking on the sidewalk. The pole fell because of the combination of the force of the impact and the pole's termite-ridden condition. If Walker asserts a claim against Telco and Rhodes, will Walker prevail?
747	Devlin was charged with murder. Several witnesses testified that the crime was committed by a person of Devlin's general description who walked with a severe limp. Devlin in fact walks with a severe limp. He objected to a prosecution request that the court order him to walk across the courtroom in order to display his limp to the jury to assist it in determining whether Devlin was the person that the witnesses had seen. Devlin's objection will most likely be
748	A little more than five years ago, Len completed construction of a single-family home located on Homeacre, a lot that Len owned. Five years ago, Len and Tina entered into a valid five-year written lease of Homeacre that included the following language: "This house is rented as is, without certain necessary or useful items. The parties agree that Tina may acquire and install such items as she wishes at her expense, and that she may remove them if she wishes at the termination of this lease." Tina decided that the house needed, and she paid cash to have installed, standard- sized combination screen/storm windows, a freestanding refrigerator to fit a kitchen alcove built for that purpose, a built-in electric stove and oven to fit a kitchen counter opening left for that purpose, and carpeting to cover the plywood living room floor. Last month, by legal description of the land, Len conveyed Homeacre to Pete for $100,000. Pete knew of Tina's soon-expiring tenancy, but did not examine the written lease. As the lease expiration date approached, Pete learned that Tina planned to vacate on schedule, and learned for the first time that Tina claimed and planned to remove all of the above-listed items that she had installed. Pete promptly brought an appropriate action to enjoin Tina from removing those items. The court should decide that Tina may remove
749	A father was terminally ill with a particularly painful form of cancer. His daughter visited him every evening in the hospital and for several months listened to his pleas to put him out of his misery. On her final visit, she gave her father a hug and then pulled a small revolver from her purse. She fired a shot at her father, killing him instantly. The daughter immediately broke into tears and surrendered to the police. The daughter was charged with her father's death. What is the most serious offense of which the daughter can be convicted?
750	Adam owns Townacres in fee simple, and Bess owns the adjoining Greenacres in fee simple. Adam has kept the lawns and trees on Townacres trimmed and neat. Bess "lets nature take its course" at Greenacres. The result on Greenacres is a tangle of underbrush, fallen trees, and standing trees that are in danger of losing limbs. Many of the trees on Greenacres are near Townacres. In the past, debris and large limbs have been blown from Greenacres onto Townacres. By local standards Greenacres is an eyesore that depresses market values of real property in the vicinity, but the condition of Greenacres violates no applicable laws or ordinances. Adam demanded that Bess keep the trees near Townacres trimmed. Bess refused. Adam brought an appropriate action against Bess to require Bess to abate what Adam alleges to be a nuisance. In the lawsuit, the only issue is whether the condition of Greenacres constitutes a nuisance. The strongest argument that Adam can present is that the condition of Greenacres
751	A woman and her friend lived together in the woman's home for 20 years. Subsequently, the woman became disabled because of a heart ailment and the friend had to take care of her. The woman told the friend that she wanted to be sure that the friend got her house after she died, so she gave the friend a quitclaim deed. The friend did not record the deed, but put it in his safe deposit box. Four months later, the woman's son found out about this and told his mother that if she would sell the house to him, she could live there for the rest of her life. The woman, who wanted the money, agreed and carried out the transaction. She told the friend that she had changed her mind and decided to leave the home to her children. The friend promised to destroy the deed, and the next day, he did. Several days later, however, as the friend and the woman were driving to the store, their car was hit by a train and they both died. The woman's and the friend's heirs claim title to the house. In an appropriate action to resolve this dispute, the most likely finding by the court will be:
752	The defendant was being sued by the plaintiff for driving his car negligently and injuring the plaintiff. The defendant called as a witness his brother, who was in the passenger seat of the defendant's car when the accident occurred. His brother testified that the defendant was driving safely and well below the posted 55-mile-perhour speed limit. Shortly before the trial began, the brother's secretary telephoned the plaintiff and told him that the brother has been understating his income to the government for years. The Internal Revenue Service has never charged the brother with tax evasion, but the secretary's information was accurate. On cross-examination, the plaintiff's attorney asked the brother, "Have you ever cheated on your tax returns?" The defendant's attorney objects. The objection should be:
753	A state that is subject to severe winters generally allows the use of studded tires between October 1 and March 31. However, the legislation allows counties to opt out and prohibit the use of studded tires year round, because studded tires tend to tear up pavement more than nonstudded tires, thus necessitating more frequent road repairs. No other state in the region allows use of studded snow tires at all. The state law contains one exception: it excludes "doctors" from any county ban on the use of snow tires because they might have to cross county lines in emergencies. After the passage of the legislation, only one county in the state invoked its right to ban the use of studded snow tires. A lawyer who lives in the state was angered that the legislature had given special privileges to doctors but not to lawyers. One January day, with studded tires on his car, he drove from his home county, which allowed use of studded tires, into the county that banned them. A sheriff's officer noticed the lawyer's studded tiresand cited him. After being convicted and fined, the lawyer appealed. The lawyer's best argument for getting the ban invalidated is:
754	Argus Corporation is privately owned and incorporated in the state of Kiowa. It contracted with the United States to construct a dam across the Big Sandy River in the state of Arapahoe. The state of Arapahoe imposed a gross receipts tax on all business conducted within the state. Arapahoe sued Argus Corporation to collect that tax on the receipts Argus received under this federal contract. No federal statutes or administrative rules are applicable, and the contract between the United States and the Argus Corporation does not mention state taxation. The court should hold the state tax, as applied here, to be

Asa part of the practice of their religious beliefs, a cat w.as required to be sacrificed to the glory of Satan after a live dissection of the animal in w which it endured frightful pain. In the course of such a religious sacrifice. Leonard was arrested on the complaint of the local Humane Society and charged under a statute punishing cruelty to animals. On appeal, a conviction of Leonard probably will be
756	In the application for a life insurance policy, Mary answered in the negative the question, "Have you ever had any heart disease?" Both the application and the insurance policy which was issued provided: "Applicant warrants the truthfulness of the statements made in the application and they are made conditions to the cont ract of insurance." Unknown to Mary, she had had a heart disease at a very early age. The policy provided that the proceeds were not to be paid over to the named beneficiary, Mary's daughter, Joan, "until she reaches the age of 21." No contingent beneficiary was named in the policy. Mary was killed in an automobile accident two months after the policy was issued. Joan died one month later at the age of 19 from injuries incurred in the same accident. If the question is raised in an action against the insurance company, how is the court likely to construe the clause dealing with the truthfulness of statements in the application?
757	The most generally accepted basis on which a court will hold that X has a legal duty to aid another is the recognition by X that there is immediate danger of serious harm to
758	Dexter was tried for the homicide of a girl whose strangled body was found beside a remote logging road with her hands taped together. After Dexter offered evidence of alibi, the state calls Wilma to testify that Dexter had taped her hands and tried to strangle her in the same location two days before the homicide but that she escaped. The evidence is
759	A small town had a municipal auditorium that all groups were permitted to use. Lately, a local preacher has begun to hold recruiting seminars for his religious cult at the auditorium. Sensing the displeasure of the voting public and fearing that the auditorium would become a mecca for fringe religious groups, the town council adopted the following ordinance: "Effective immediately, no religious groups will be permitted to use the municipal auditorium for meetings, speeches, or other public gatherings." The preacher, who was having great success recruiting followers in the town, challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance in federal court. Based on the above facts, his challenge should:
760	Retailer, a dry goods retailer, telephoned Manufacturer, a towel manufacturer, and offered to buy for $5 each a minimum of 500 and a maximum of 1,000 large bath towels, to be delivered in 30 days. Manufacturer orally accepted this offer and promptly sent the following letter to Retailer, which Retailer received two days later: "This confirms our agreement today by telephone to sell you 500 large bath towels for 30-day delivery. /s/ Manufacturer." Twenty-eight days later, Manufacturer tendered to Retailer 1,000 (not 500) conforming bath towels, all of which Retailer rejected because it had found a better price term from another supplier. Because of a glut in the towel market, Manufacturer cannot resell the towels except at a loss. In a suit by Manufacturer against Retailer, which of the following will be the probable decision?
761	In response to a number of accidents involving pedestrians in the local business district, a city enacted a statute making it illegal for a pedestrian to walk through the central business district anywhere other than on the sidewalk. The city also enacted a statute making it illegal for any business to obstruct the sidewalk in front of its establishment. As a man was walking along the sidewalk in the central business district, he discovered that a shopkeeper had stacked a pile of boxes in front of his establishment in such a way that it totally obstructed the sidewalk. The man stepped into the street to walk around the obstruction of boxes and was struck by a cab driver driving negligently. The jurisdiction follows traditional contributory negligence rules. If the man asserts a claim against the cab driver, the man's act of leaving the sidewalk and walking into the street will have which of the following effects?
762	Structo contracted with Bailey to construct for $500,000 a warehouse and an access driveway at highway level. Shortly after commencing work on the driveway, which required for the specified level some excavation and removal of surface material, Structo unexpectedly encountered a large mass of solid rock. For this question only, assume the following facts. Upon encountering the rock formation, Structo, instead of incurring additional costs to remove it, built the access driveway over the rock with a steep grade down to the highway. Bailey, who was out of town for several days, was unaware of this nonconformity until the driveway had been finished. As built, it is too steep to be used safely by trucks or cars, particularly in the wet or icy weather frequently occurring in the area. It would cost $30,000 to tear out and rebuild the driveway at highway level. As built, the warehouse, including the driveway, has a fair market value of $550,000. Bailey has paid $470,000 to Structo, but refuses to pay more because of the nonconforming driveway, which Structo has refused to tear out and rebuild. If Structo sues Bailey for monetary relief, what is the maximum amount Structo is entitled to recover?
763	The class president invited his class to his home to celebrate homecoming. When the sun began to set, a student built a bonfire in the backyard. The student continued to feed the flames until the bonfire was quite large. Suddenly, a gust of wind blew the flames to a neighboring property, igniting the neighbor's shed. If the neighbor sues the student for the damage to his shed on a theory of negligence, under which of the following arguments, if sustained by the facts, would the student avoid liability?
764	A defendant was arrested for carrying a concealed weapon in violation of his parole. The police had reason to believe that the defendant was part of a group that sold stolen automobile parts. The police interrogated the defendant continually for 10 hours. Finally, the police threatened to have the defendant's parole revoked if he did not cooperate. Fatigued from the lengthy interrogation and afraid of going back to jail, the defendant confessed to being a member of the group involved in the theft of automobile parts. The defendant gave the police the location of a friend's garage where the stolen parts were located. Based on this confession, the police obtained a search warrant to search the garage, where they discovered a large quantity of stolen automobile parts. The defendant was prosecuted for conspiracy to sell stolen automobile parts. Before trial, he moved to prevent use of the stolen parts as evidence. The court will most likely rule that the evidence should be:
765	A leading computer supply retailer contacted a manufacturer of flash drives on October 25 to supplement the supply of flash drives at the retailer's area stores. In response, the manufacturer offered to supply 50 boxes of flash drives at $200 a box, for a total price of $10,000, delivery one week after acceptance, and sent a letter containing those contractual terms to the retailer on October 26. The president of the retailer signed the letter on October 27 without making any changes to it and sent it back to the manufacturer by first class mail. The next day, having not heard from the retailer, the manufacturer's sales manager contacted the president of the retailer and informed him that, if the retailer accepted by the end of the month, it would receive a 1% discount on the total price. When the retailer's president responded that he had already sent the acceptance, the sales manager assured him that the discount would still apply. On October 31, the retailer received a circular from a competing source offering comparable flash drives for 5% less than the manufacturer's price. The retailer immediately faxed a rejection to the manufacturer. The manufacturer received the rejection immediately but took no action on it. The next day, November 1, the manufacturer received the signed contract from the retailer. What is the status of the parties' agreement?
766	A hunter who held a hunting license issued by the state was hunting elk in that state, which was permitted by state hunting regulations. The hunter was hunting on private land when he spied an elk. The elk was 200 yards away, inside a fence that surrounded a federal military base located in the state. The hunter shot the elk from where he was standing, but entered the military base to retrieve the carcass. A federal statute prohibits the removal of wild animals or the carcasses thereof from United States military bases. The hunter was prosecuted and convicted under the federal statute. The hunter appeals his conviction on the grounds that state hunting regulations require the retrieval of any game that a hunter kills. The best argument to uphold the conviction would be based on:
767	A professional wrestler entered into a written agency contract with an agent, who agreed to try to get the wrestler's picture on a variety of food products. The wrestler promised that the agent would have the exclusive right to promote the wrestler on food product lines. They agreed that the wrestler would receive 70% of the proceeds and that the agent would receive 30%. The agent was able to persuade a breakfast cereal company to put the wrestler's picture on their cereal boxes. Shortly after the agent confirmed the cereal deal with the cereal manufacturer, the wrestler and the agent agreed orally that henceforth the wrestler would receive 50% of the proceeds, including proceeds from the cereal deal, and the agent would receive the other 50%. The wrestler received a $10,000 check from the cereal manufacturer, and he promptly sent the agent a check for $3,000. The agent demanded an additional $2,000, but the wrestler refused to pay. If the agent sues the wrestler for the $2,000, the party likely to prevail is:
768	On April 15, a wholesaler of tulip bulbs telephoned a local nursery and offered to sell to the nursery 80 gross of tulip bulbs for $8,000, not including delivery charges. The nursery accepted immediately. On April 17, the nursery sent the wholesaler a letter confirming the deal for the sale of 80 gross of tulip bulbs for $8,000, and stating that it anticipated a waiver of the delivery charges because of the size of the order. On May 3, the wholesaler telephoned the nursery and stated that, due to a poor growing season for tulips, it would not be able to supply any tulip bulbs to the nursery. If the nursery brings suit against the wholesaler and the wholesaler asserts the Statute of Frauds as a defense, will the nursery prevail?
769	A dealer had a contract with a city to supply the city with five computers a month for seven months. At the start of the fourth month, the dealer realized that his supply of computers had dwindled to one. The dealer immediately sent a fax to his supplier asking for a price quote for 20 computers to be delivered before the first of next month. The supplier responded by fax: "I can deliver 20 computers from my present stock at a cost of $1,000 per computer." The dealer responded the next day with another fax that stated: "I will buy 20 computers at a cost of $1,000 per computer." Assuming no further communications between the parties, has a contract been formed at this point?
770	A retailer of desktop and laptop computers decided to purchase a certain model of highspeed printers from a wholesaler and then offer the printers for sale as part of a complete system with its keyboards and computers. Because printing speed was important, the written agreement between the wholesaler and the retailer provided that the printers must be able to print 30 pages per minute or more. The wholesaler was to provide, during the term of the agreement, 150 printers for the retailer at $300 each. The printers were to be delivered at the rate of 10 per month, commencing March 15, and the retailer was to pay for the printers as they were delivered. When the first shipment arrived, the retailer paid for it with a cashier's check for $2,000. However, when the retailer put one of the printers on line with its system, it found that the printer was printing at a rate of only 20 pages per minute. The retailer then tested the entire shipment and found that none of the printers met the contract specifications. Although the printers did not meet the specifications, the retailer was under contract with its own lawyers to deliver two systems by April 1. The retailer negotiated with the lawyers, and it was agreed that the retailer would install the two systems with the printers, but that the retailer would have to deliver by December two high speed printers that met the contract specifications at no extra cost to the lawyers, as replacements for these two printers. Immediately on making this agreement, the retailer sent an email to the wholesaler of the printers, telling the wholesaler that the shipment did not conform to the contract, but that it was contractually obligated to use two of the printers. It also stated that no further shipments would be accepted. Because of the sale of the systems with the nonconforming printers to its lawyers, the retailer has accepted:
771	Tune Corporation, a radio manufacturer, and Bill's Comex, Inc., a retailer, after extensive negotiations entered into a final, written agreement in which Tune agreed to sell and Bill's agreed to buy all of its requirements of radios, estimated at 20 units per month, during the period January 1, 1988, and December 31, 1990, at a price of $50 per unit. A dispute arose in late December, 1990, when Bill's returned 25 undefective radios to Tune for full credit after Tune had refused to extend the contract for a second three-year period. In an action by Tune against Bill's for damages due to return of the 25 radios, Tune introduces the written agreement, which expressly permitted the buyer to return defective radios for credit but was silent as to return of undefective radios for credit. Bill's seeks to introduce evidence that during the three years of the agreement it had returned, for various reasons, 125 undefective radios, for which Tune had granted full credit. Tune objects to the admissibility of this evidence. The trial court will probably rule that the evidence proffered by Bill's is
772	A motorcyclist was injured in a collision and suffered $100,000 worth of injuries, including $20,000 in hospital and physician's bills. The motorcyclist's medical insurance company paid her $20,000 to cover hospital and medical expenses. Later, she filed suit against the driver of the car that struck her motorcycle. When the case came to trial, the jury agreed with the motorcyclist's contention that her injuries were worth $100,000. The jury also determined that the motorcyclist was 30% negligent and that the driver was 70% negligent. How much should the motorcyclist recover from the driver?
773	In a rape case in which the issue is whether the victim consented, the defense attorney calls a witness and asks him if he knows the victim's reputation in the community for chastity. The witness laughs and then declares, "The victim's reputation for chastity? It's a joke! She's been to bed with everyone-including me!" The prosecution moves to strike the witness's testimony. The judge should:
774	The defendant demanded that her neighbor cut down bushes that blocked her view, but the neighbor refused. Furious, the defendant slapped the neighbor. In response, the neighbor grabbed a pistol from her purse and fired a shot at the defendant, but missed. Just as her neighbor cocked the pistol to fire another shot, the defendant grabbed a shovel and hit her neighbor over the head, killing her instantly. The defendant was charged with the common law murder of her neighbor. At trial, the defendant testified that she hit her neighbor because she believed that her neighbor would have shot and killed her if she did not. If the jury believes the defendant, it should find her:
775	Robert walked into a store that had a checkcashing service and tried to cash a $550 check which was payable to him. The attendant on duty refused to cash the check because Robert did not have two forms of identification, which the store's policies required. Robert, who had no money except for the check and who needed cash to pay for food and a place to sleep, became agitated. He put his hand into his pocket and growled, "Give me the money or I'll start shooting." The attendant, who knew Robert as a neighborhood character, did not believe that he was violent or had a gun. However, because the attendant felt sorry for Robert, he handed over the cash. Robert left the check on the counter and departed. The attendant picked up the check and found that Robert had failed to endorse it. If Robert is guilty of any crime, he is most likely guilty of
776	The defendant rented a room for two nights at a motel. The room was equipped with a large color television set. The defendant decided to steal the set, pawn it, and keep the proceeds. To conceal his identity as the thief, he contrived to make his room look as if it had been burglarized. However, he was traced through the pawnbroker and arrested. On these facts, the defendant is guilty of:
777	An uncle's will devised his lakefront estate "to my butler for life, remainder to my niece." The 40-acre estate includes a mansion, a 20-acre orchard, a beach, and gardens. At the time of the uncle's death, the butler was 40 years old and of modest means. The niece was 18 years old and quite wealthy. The estate was encumbered by a mortgage that was not entitled to exoneration. After the first year, the butler could no longer make the mortgage payments, so the niece paid them. Ten years after the uncle's death, the town in which the estate was located became a hot resort area. A major resort chain approached the butler with a multimillion-dollar offer for the easternmost 20 acres of the estate, which included the residence and beach. The resort chain planned to raze the mansion to erect a high-rise hotel. The butler approached the niece about the offer. He proposed to give her most of the money from the sale and offered to build any house she desired on the remaining land. The niece refused to go along with the plan. The butler decided to proceed with the sale, and the niece brought a suit to enjoin the butler's proposed actions. Which of the following is the niece's best argument?
778	A backgammon player was upset after losing a match against the club champion. Rushing out of the club, he inadvertently grabbed the champion's board, which looked very much like his own but which was much more expensive. The player left the backgammon board in the trunk of his car, as was his usual practice. During the night, the car was stolen and along with it, the champion's expensive backgammon board. In an action by the champion against the player to recover the value of the backgammon board, the champion will likely:
779	Congress determined that there should be a uniform law for handgun registration throughout the United States and enacted the Federal Firearms Act. Which of the following constitutional provisions could most easily be considered the basis of such enactment?
780	On March I, Green and Brown orally agreed that Brown would erect a boathouse on Green's lot and dig a channel from the boathouse, across Clark's lot, to a lake. Clark had already orally agreed with Green to permit the digging of the channel across Clark's lot. Brown agreed to begin work on the boathouse on March 15, and to complete all the work before June 1. The total price of $10,000 was to be paid by Green in three installments: $2,500 on March 15; $2,500 when the boathouse was completed; $5,000 when Brown finished the digging of the channel. Assume that Green paid the $2,500 on March 15 and that Brown completed the boathouse according to specifications, but that Green then refused to pay the second installment and repudiated the contract. Assume further that the absence of a writing is not raised as a defense. Which of the following is (are) correct? I. Brown has a cause of action against Green and his damages will be $2,500 II. Brown can refuse to dig the channel and not be liable for breach of contract
781	Photo, a free-lance photographer, took a Picture of Player in front of Shoe Store. Player was a nationally known amateur basketball star who had received much publicity in the press. At the time, the window display in Shoe Store featured "Jumpers," a well-known make of basketball shoes. Photo sold the picture, greatly enlarged, to Shoe Store and told Shoe Store that Photo had Player's approval to do so and that Player had consented to Shoe Store's showing the enlarged picture in the window. Shoe Store made no effort to ascertain whether Player had given his consent to Photo. In fact, Player did not even know that Photo had taken the picture. Shoe Store put the enlarged picture in the window with the display of "Jumpers" shoes. The college that Player attended believed that Player had intentionally endorsed Shoe Store and "Jumpers" shoes, and the college cancelled his athletic scholarship. If Player asserts a claim based on defamation against Shoe Store, will Player prevail?
782	Stirrup, a rancher, and Equinox, a fancier of horses, signed the following writing: "For $5,000, Stirrup will sell to Equinox a gray horse that Equinox may choose from among the grays on Stirrup's ranch." Equinox refused to accept delivery of a gray horse timely tendered by Stirrup or to choose among those remaining, on the ground that during their negotiations Stirrup had orally agreed to include a saddle, worth $100, and also to give Equinox the option to choose a gray or a brown horse. Equinox insisted on one of Stirrup's brown horses, but Stirrup refused to part with any of his browns or with the saddle as demanded by Equinox. If Equinox sues Stirrup for damages and seeks to introduce evidence of the alleged oral agreement, the court probably will
783	A doctor and a lawyer owned adjoining parcels of land. Ten years ago, the doctor installed a swimming pool on her land. The doctor obtained the lawyer's oral consent to run plumbing from the pool across part of the lawyer's land. Last year, the lawyer sold his land to a buyer. The buyer wants to plant a garden on the land under which the doctor's plumbing runs, and wants to eject the doctor and quiet title. The statute of limitations for ejectment is seven years. With respect to the land under which the plumbing was laid:
784	Twenty-five years ago, a man purchased a vacant tract of land from a woman. Unbeknownst to the man, the woman did not own the land. Someone else owned the land in fee simple. Shortly after the purchase, the man built a house on the northwest corner of the tract, leaving the rest of the tract vacant. Recently, the actual owner of the tract died, still without knowledge that the man had built a house on the northwest corner of the tract. The actual owner's will left all of his property to his son. The relevant statutory period for adverse possession is 20 years. If the man brings suit to quiet title to the tract he had purchased 25 years ago, the court should decide that:
785	A state passed a statute requiring all employers in the state to provide a medical insurance plan for full-time employees. A state trade association to which many state employers belong brought suit in federal court, asking the court to strike down the statute as unconstitutional. Which of the following best reflects the burden of persuasion in this case?
786	A landowner sustained injuries in a boating accident that required an extended hospital stay. During his absence, a trespasser entered into a contract with an accountant to purchase the landowner's land. The trespasser forged the landowner's signature on a quitclaim deed, which the accountant promptly and properly recorded. Two months later, the accountant received notice that he was being transferred, so he conveyed the land to a buyer by a general warranty deed. The buyer promptly and properly recorded the deed. The following month, the landowner returned to his land and ejected the buyer. The jurisdiction in which the land is located has the following statute: "No unrecorded conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value without notice unless the conveyance is recorded." Under which of the following theories is the buyer most likely to have a remedy?
787	John Doe, the owner of a milk container manufacturing firm, sought to focus public attention on the milk packaging law of the State of Clinton in order to have it repealed. On a weekday at 12:00 noon, he delivered an excited, animated, and loud harangue on the steps of the State Capitol in front of the main entryway. An audience of 200 onlookers, who gathered on the steps, heckled him and laughed as he delivered his tirade. Doe repeatedly stated, gesturing expressively and making faces, that "the g-ddamned milk packaging law is stupid," and that "I will strangle every one of those g-ddamned legislators I can get hold of because this law they created proves they are all too dumb to live." After about fifteen minutes, Doe stopped speaking, and the amused crowd dispersed. There are three relevant statutes of the State of Clinton. The first statute prohibits "all speech making, picketing, and public gatherings of every sort on the Capitol steps in front of the main entryway between 7:45 a.m. -8:15 a.m., 11:45 a.m. -12:15 p.m., 12:45 p.m. -1:15 p.m., and 4:45 p.m. -5:15 p.m., on Capitol working days." The "Capitol steps" statute is probably
788	On March 1, Mechanic contracted to repair Textiles' knitting machine and to complete the job by March 6. On March 2, Textiles contracted to manufacture and deliver specified cloth to Knitwear on March 15. Textiles knew that it would have to use the machine then under repair to perform this contract. Because the Knitwear order was for a rush job, Knitwear and Textiles included in their contract a liquidated damages clause, providing that Textiles would pay $5,000 for each day's delay in delivery after March 15. Mechanic was inexcusably five days late in repairing the machine, and, as a result, Textiles was five days late in delivering the cloth to Knitwear. Textiles paid $25,000 to Knitwear as liquidated damages and now sues Mechanic for $25,000. Both Mechanic and Textiles knew when making their contract on March 1 that under ordinary circumstances Textiles would sustain little or no damages of any kind as a result of a five-day delay in the machine repair. Assuming that the $5,000 liquidated damages clause in the Knitwear-Textiles contract is valid, which of the following arguments will serve as Mechanic's best defense to Textiles' action?
789	In the course of repainting an apartment, the landlord of a small apartment building used a professional strength, stain-killing primer manufactured by a paint company for professional painters. The building's common ventilation system was running as the landlord applied the primer, and some fumes from the primer went through the ventilation system into the apartment of the upstairs tenant, who suffered injuries to her eyes as a result. The warning label on the can, which the landlord read, stated: "Danger. This material is extremely hazardous and volatile. Do not use near open flame. Use only with adequate ventilation." The product contained a chemical known to be harmful to people's eyes, but in the 15 years that the product has been on the market, there were no reported cases of anyone suffering an eye injury from the product. However, professional painters routinely close off or shut down any common ventilation systems in buildings before using the product. If the tenant brings an action against the paint company on a theory of strict liability, will she recover?
790	A new homeowner had two dogs that frequently barked at birds and squirrels in the yard, especially during the day while the homeowner was at work. A neighbor who worked nights was aggravated by the barking, which disturbed his sleep, and decided to let the homeowner know how he felt. One evening, upon learning that the homeowner was entertaining her boss and several clients, the neighbor came to her front door with a boombox and started playing a recording of the dogs barking, putting it at full volume. When the homeowner came to the door, he began yelling at her and berating her in front of her guests for having no consideration for her neighbors, while continuing to play the recording. The homeowner was very upset, especially because her guests decided that they had better leave, and she ended up losing a bonus that her boss was going to give her at the end of the evening. If the homeowner asserts a claim based on intentional infliction of emotional distress against the neighbor, what will be the probable result?
791	Which of the following fact patterns most clearly suggests an implied-in-fact contract?
792	The State of Yuma provides by statute, ''No person may be awarded any state construction contract without agreeing to employ only citizens of the state and of the United States in performance of the contract.' If the Yuma statute is attacked as violating the commerce clause, which of the following defenses is the WEAKEST?
793	While browsing in a clothing store, Alice decided to take a purse without paying for it. She placed the purse under her coat and took a couple of steps toward the exit. She then realized that a sensor tag on the purse would set off an alarm. She placed the purse near the counter from which she had removed it. Alice has committed
794	Blackacre is a large tract of land owned by a religious order known as The Seekers. On Blackacre, The Seekers erected a large residential building where its members reside. Blackacre is surrounded by rural residential properties and its only access to a public way is afforded by an easement over a strip of land 30 feet wide. The easement was granted to The Seekers by deed from Sally, the owner of one of the adjacent residential properties. The Seekers built a driveway on the strip, and the easement was used for 20 years without incident or objection. Last year, as permitted by the applicable zoning ordinance, The Seekers constructed a 200-bed nursing home and a parking lot on Blackacre, using all of Blackacre that was available for such development. The nursing home was very successful, and on Sundays visitors to the nursing home overflowed the parking facilities on Blackacre and parked all along the driveway from early in the morning through the evening hours. After two Sundays of the resulting congestion and inconvenience, Sally erected a barrier across the driveway on Sundays preventing any use of the driveway by anyone seeking access to Blackacre. The Seekers objected. Sally brought an appropriate action to terminate the easement. The most likely result in this action is that the court will hold for
795	A mapping service on the Internet that provided maps and satellite images of urban areas developed a "tourist view" option that offered street level views on its website of many downtown locations in major cities. In one of the street view images posted by the mapping service, a pedestrian could be seen on the steps outside the doors of a business while smoking a cigarette. He was recognized on the website by his supervisor, who was surprised to see him smoking because he had obtained an employee health insurance discount by affirming that he was a nonsmoker. If the pedestrian sues the mapping service for invasion of privacy, how should the court rule?
796	Able, owner of Blackacre and Whiteacre, two adjoining parcels, conveyed Whiteacre to Baker and covenanted in the deed to Baker that when he, Able, sold Blackacre he would impose restrictive covenants to prohibit uses that would compete with the filling station that Baker intended to construct and operate on Whiteacre. The deed was not recorded. Baker constructed and operated a filling station on Whiteacre and then conveyed Whiteacre to Dodd, who continued the filling station use. The deed did not refer to the restrictive covenant and was promptly and properly recorded. Able then conveyed Blackacre to Egan, who knew about Able's covenant with Baker to impose a covenant prohibiting the filling station use but nonetheless completed the transaction when he noted that no such covenant was contained in Able's deed to him. Egan began to construct a filling station on Blackacre. Dodd brought an appropriate action to enjoin Egan from using Blackacre for filling station purposes. If Dodd prevails, it will be because
797	Twenty years ago, Test, who owned Blackacre, a one-acre tract of land, duly delivered a deed of Blackacre "to School District so long as it is used for school purposes." The deed was promptly and properly recorded. Five years ago, Test died leaving Sonny as his only heir but, by his duly probated will, he left "all my Estate to my friend Fanny." Last month, School District closed its school on Blackacre and for valid consideration duly executed and delivered a quitclaim deed of Blackacre to Owner, who planned to use the land for commercial development. Owner has now brought an appropriate action to quiet title against Sonny, Fanny, and School District. The only applicable statute is a provision in the jurisdiction's probate code which provides that any property interest which is descendible is devisable. In such action, the court should find that title is now in
798	A seller with a very leaky roof was told that she would need it replaced before she could sell the home. Instead, the seller painted the shingles that could be seen from the street to make them appear new, and covered the watermarks on the interior. A buyer entered into a written contract with the seller that included a clause making the buyer's obligation to tender the purchase price at the closing date "subject to approval by an inspector of the buyer's choosing." Prior to closing, the buyer inspected the property with his friend, a local tradesman with a good reputation. Neither the buyer nor the friend climbed onto the roof, but the friend mentioned that the roof looked fairly new. The friend also looked for signs of water damage to the ceilings and walls on the interior, but found none. At closing, the seller conveyed the property to the buyer by warranty deed. Three months after the buyer moved into the home, a major rainstorm occurred. The roof leaked like a sieve and much of the buyer's personal property was damaged. The buyer replaced the roof at a cost of $8,000. The buyer's homeowner's insurance covered the cost of the water damage to his floors and personal property, but would not reimburse his expenses incurred in installing the new roof, which the insurance carrier deemed "normal maintenance and repair." If the buyer sues the seller for the $8,000 cost of installing a new roof, the court is likely to rule in favor of:
799	Jack, a bank teller, was fired by Morgan, the president of the bank. Jack decided to take revenge against Morgan, but decided against attempting it personally, because he knew Morgan was protected around the clock by bank security guards. Jack knew that Chip had a violent temper and was very jealous. Jack falsely told Chip that Chip's wife, Elsie, was having an affair with Morgan. Enraged, Chip said, "What am I going to do?" Jack said, "If it were my wife, I'd just march into his office and blow his brains out." Chip grabbed a revolver and rushed to the bank. He walked into the bank, carrying the gun in his hand. One of the security guards, believing a holdup was about to occur, shot and killed Chip. If charged with murder of Chip, Jack should be found
800	Which of the following suits would not fall within the United States Supreme Court's original jurisdiction under Article III, Section 2?
801	A resident being interviewed live by a television reporter stated that, "The biggest problem in this city is corruption in city government, particularly the mayor." The mayor has now brought an action for defamation against the resident. At trial, the mayor has produced testimony as to his honesty and good character. As part of his defense, the defendant seeks to offer into evidence the fact that the mayor was convicted two years ago of taking a bribe to award a city contract for solid waste disposal. Is the evidence admissible?
802	The strongest constitutional basis for the enactment of a federal statute requiring colleges and universities receiving federal funds to offer student aid solely on the basis of need is the
803	On February 1, the owner of a bowling alley read an ad from a major manufacturer of bowling balls offering 40 balls in various weights and drilled in various sizes for $10 per ball. The owner immediately filled out the order form for the 40 balls and deposited it, properly stamped and addressed, into the mail. On February 2, the bowling alley owner received in the mail a letter from the manufacturer, sent out as part of its advertising campaign, stating in relevant part that it will sell the bowling alley owner 40 bowling balls at $10 per ball. A day later, on February 3, the manufacturer received the bowling alley owner's order. On February 4, the balls were shipped. On what day did an enforceable contract arise?
804	Lord leased a warehouse building and the lot on which it stood to Taylor for a term of ten years. The lease contained a clause prohibiting Taylor from subletting his interest. Can Taylor assign his interest under the lease?
805	Light Company is the sole distributor of electrical power in City. The Company owns and maintains all of the electric poles and equipment in City. Light Company has complied with the National Electrical Safety Code, which establishes minimum requirements for the installation and maintenance of power poles. The Code has been approved by the federal and state governments. Light Company has had to replace insulators on its poles repeatedly because unknown persons repeatedly shoot at and destroy them. This causes the power lines to fall to the ground. On one of these occasions, Paul, Faber's 5-year-old son, wandered out of Faber's yard, intentionally touched a downed wire, and was seriously burned. If a claim on Paul's behalf is asserted against Light Company, the probable result is that Paul will
806	A homeowner entered into a written agreement with a contractor to remodel the homeowner's basement for a set amount. Among the contract's specifications was a provision that the contractor was to use an imported Brazilian hardwood for the paneling. The contractor began the job, and then assigned his right to payment under the agreement to a creditor. When the job was a little more than half completed, the homeowner sold the house to a buyer. In a document separate from the deed of conveyance, the homeowner assigned her right to the contractor's labor and delegated her duty to pay under the contract to the buyer. The contractor completed the job on time but used Wyoming knotty pine instead of Brazilian hardwood for the paneling. The knotty pine is considered to be inferior to the Brazilian hardwood and is much less expensive, and the buyer was very displeased when he saw the result. Who can the buyer sue for breach?
807	While driving his car down the road, the defendant, who had no history of heart problems, experienced a heart attack. The defendant's car crossed the center line of the highway, in violation of a motor vehicle statute, and headed directly at a car driven by the plaintiff that was exceeding the speed limit. The plaintiff, seeing the defendant's car heading toward him, swerved to avoid the collision. In so doing, the plaintiff's car spun out of control and crashed into a ditch, causing the plaintiff injury. The plaintiff brought suit against the defendant for the injuries sustained in the accident. The jurisdiction retains traditional contributory negligence rules. The plaintiff will:
808	Congress provides by statute that any state that fails to prohibit automobile speeds of over 55 miles per hour on highways within the state shall be denied all federal highway construction funding. The state of Atlantic, one of the richest and most highway-oriented states in the country, refuses to enact such a statute. The strongest argument that can be made in support of the constitutionality of this federal statute is that
809	A nonprofit group entered into a written contract with a builder to construct an afterschool center in an urban neighborhood plagued by crime, on land that it owned. After the building had been completed except for exterior gutters and downspouts and interior painting, the entire structure was destroyed by a fire set by vandals. The builder's expenses had been so great, and the builder was so frustrated that his work was destroyed by hooligans, that he refused to rebuild the building. Under traditional contract law principles, the builder can recover from the nonprofit group:
810	A federal statute sets up a program of dental education. The statute provides that the Secretary of Health and Human Services "shall, on a current basis, spend all of the money appropriated for this purpose" and "shall distribute the appropriated funds" by a specified formula to state health departments that agree I to participate in the program. In the current year I Congress has appropriated $100 million for expenditure on this program. In order to ensure a budget surplus in the current fiscal year, the President issues an executive order directing the various cabinet secretaries to cut expenditures in this year by 10 percent in all categories. He also orders certain programs to be cut more drastically because he believes that "they are not as important to the general welfare as other programs" The President identifies the dental education program as such a program and orders it to be cut by 50 percent. Assume that no other federal statutes are relevant. To satisfy constitutional requirements, how much money must the Secretary of Health and Human Services distribute for the dental education program this year?
811	Amos owned Greenfield, a tract of land. His friend Bert wanted to buy Greenfield and offered $20,000 for it. Amos knew that Bert was insolvent, but replied, "As a favor to you as an old friend, I will sell Greenfield to you for $20,000, even though it is worth much more, if you can raise the money within one month." Bert wrote the following words, and no more, on a piece of paper: "I agree to sell Greenfield for $20,000." Amos then signed the piece of paper and gave it to Bert. Three days later, Amos received an offer of $40,000 for Greenfield. He asked Bert if he had raised the $20,000. When Bert answered, "Not yet," Amos told him that their deal was off and that he was going to accept the $40,000 offer. The next week, Bert secured a bank commitment to enable him to purchase Greenfield. Bert immediately brought an appropriate action against Amos to compel Amos to convey Greenfield to him. The following points will be raised during the course of the trial. I. The parol evidence rule. II. Construction of the contract as to time of performance. III. Bert's ability to perform. Which will be relevant to a decision in favor of Bert?
812	Brown contended that Green owed him S6,0)00. Green denied that he owed Brown anything. Tired of the dispute. Green eventually signed a promissory note by which he promised to pay Brown 55.,t000 in settlement of their dispute. In an action by Brown against Green on the promissory note, which of the following, if true. would afford Green the best defense?
813	A state legislature passed a statute denying in-state tuition rates at any state-supported college or university for any resident aliens who were citizens of "any country which, during the previous five-year period, has held citizens of the United States as hostages." Before becoming a resident alien of the state three years ago, the plaintiff had been a citizen of a country that had held United States citizens as hostages. Prior to passage of the statute, he had been enrolled for two years at the state university and had qualified for the in-state tuition rates because he was a resident of the state. The registrar of the university has informed the plaintiff that he no longer qualifies for the in-state tuition rate, and he cannot afford to pay the nonresident tuition. If the plaintiff files an appropriate suit asking the federal courts to strike down the state statute, which of the following is his best argument?
814	In 1%7 Owen held Blackacre, a tract of land. in fee simple absolute. In that year he executed and delivered to Price a quitclaim deed which purported to release and quitclaim to Price all of the right, title and interest of Owen in Blackacre. Price accepted the quitclaim and placed the deed in his safety deposit box. Owen was indebted to Crider in the amount of S35,000. In September. 1971, Owen executed and delivered to Crider a warranty deed, purporting to convey the fee simple to Blackacre, in exchange for a full release of the debt he owed to Crider. Crider immediately recorded his deed. In December, 1971, Price caused his quitclaim deed to Blackacre to be recorded and notified Crider that he (Price) claimed title. Assume that there is no evidence of occupancy of Blackacre and assume, further, that the jurisdiction where Blackacre is situated has a recording statute which requires good faith and value as elements of the junior claimant's priority. Which of the following is the best comment concerning the conflicting claims of Price and Crider?
815	Husband and Wife, walking on a country road, were frightened by a bull running loose on the road. They climbed over a fence to get onto the adjacent property, owned by Grower. After climbing over the fence, Husband and Wife damaged some of Grower's plants which were near the fence. The fence was posted with a large sign, "No Trespassing." Grower saw Husband and Wife and came toward them with his large watchdog on a long leash. The dog rushed at Wife. Grower had intended only to frighten Husband and Wife, but the leash broke, and before Grower could restrain the dog, the dog bit Wife. If Grower asserts a claim against Wife and Husband for damage to his plants, will Grower prevail?
816	Rimm and Hill were fooling around with a pistol in Hill's den. Rimm aimed the pistol in Hill's direction and fired three shots slightly to Hill's right. One shot ricocheted off the wall and struck Hill in the back, killing him instantly. The most serious crime of which Rimm can be convicted is
817	A worker who missed his ride home because he was working late walked across the street to a tavern to get a drink. He chatted with a patron of the tavern and discovered that he lived only a short distance from the patron. The patron offered to give the worker a ride home. Although he knew the patron was probably too drunk to drive, the worker reluctantly agreed. On the way home, the patron, driving in a dangerous manner, was involved in a collision with another car, whose driver was also driving negligently, and the worker was injured. If the worker sues the patron to recover for his injuries and the above facts are established at trial, the worker's recovery:
818	Pam and Dora own adjoining lots in the central portion of a city. Each of their lots had an office building. Dora decided to raze the existing building on her lot and to erect a building of greater height. Dora has received all governmental approvals required to pursue her project. There is no applicable statute or ordinance (other than those dealing with various approvals for zoning, building, etc.). After Dora had torn down the existing building, she proceeded to excavate deeper. Dora used shoring that met all local, state, and federal safety regulations, and the shoring was placed in accordance with those standards. Pam notified Dora that cracks were developing in the building situated on Pam's lot. Dora took the view that any subsidence suffered by Pam was due to the weight of Pam's building, and correctly asserted that none would have occurred had Pam's soil been in its natural state. Dora continued to excavate. The building on Pam's lot did suffer extensive damage, requiring the expenditure of $750,000 to remedy the defects. Which of the following is the best comment concerning Pam's action to recover damages from Dora?
819	A husband was very jealous of any contact his wife had with other men, and was particularly suspicious of his wife's relationship with their neighbor, a plumber. Early one morning, the shower in the couple's master bathroom sprang a leak while the wife was getting ready for the day. Fearing permanent damage to their house, and needing to get the repair done quickly, the wife quickly threw on some clothes and called the neighbor. The neighbor immediately went over to the couple's home, and went to the master bathroom. At the same time, the husband unexpectedly came home because he had forgotten something for work. The husband went to the master bedroom and saw the neighbor and his wife with her hair wet and clothes hastily put on. Enraged, he ran to his study, grabbed his gun from the desk drawer, and shot and killed the neighbor. The jurisdiction defines murder in the first degree to include premeditated and deliberate killings and all killings that take place during the commission of a dangerous felony. Premeditation and deliberation is defined as requiring some meaningful reflection prior to the killing. All other common law murder is classified as murder in the second degree. If the jury finds that the husband was unreasonable in his erroneous belief that the neighbor and his wife were together for the purpose of adultery, the husband's killing of the neighbor was:
820	A driver and his passenger were involved in an automobile accident when the driver ran a red light and crashed into another car. Due to a manufacturing defect in the automobile's airbag system, the passenger side airbag did not deploy. The passenger was killed on impact. The passenger's estate brought suit against the driver and the airbag's manufacturer. At trial it is established that the driver was negligent in running the red light. Such proof would have the following effect on the claim of the passenger's estate against the airbag manufacturer:
821	Addle, who has been in the painting and contracting business for ten years and has a fine reputation, contracts to paint Boone's barn. Boone's barn is a standard red barn with loft. The contract has no provision regarding assignment. If Addle assigns the contract to Coot and thereafter Coot does not meet the contract specifications in painting Boone's barn. Boone
822	Congress passed legislation banning the hunting of snipe birds within the United States. The range of the snipe is quite limited; they are found primarily in only one state, although they migrate annually to several nearby states. Hunters from throughout the United States have traditionally traveled to the snipe's home state during snipe hunting season, bringing considerable revenue into the state. A state statute allows hunting of snipe during a two-week period in November and charges a $50 license fee for state residents and a $250 fee for hunters from other states. The bag limit is one snipe bird per licensed hunter. The state statute allowing snipe hunting is:
823	The owner of a corner lot allowed a hedge on his property to become overgrown, obstructing the view of motorists at that corner. Two motorists were driving inattentively and each ran a stop sign at the intersection bordering the lot. Their cars collided in the intersection and one of the motorists was injured. She sued the owner of the lot. The jury determined that the lot owner was 10% at fault and each of the motorists was 45% at fault. Will the injured motorist recover damages from the lot owner?
824	A 12-year-old girl's parents went out of town for the day, leaving her home until 5 p.m. At 2 p.m., the girl went out rollerblading and saw that a neighbor was growing prize roses in her yard. The girl entered the yard and cut all of the prize roses off the rose bushes and rollerbladed over a rose bush, causing the rose bush to die. The jurisdiction has no statute regarding parental liability. In a suit by the neighbor against the girl's parents for the damage caused to her rose bush, the neighbor should:
825	Park sued Dent for breach of an oral contract which Dent denied making. Weston testified that he heard Dent make the contract on July 7. Dent discredited Weston, and Park offers evidence of Weston's good reputation for truthfulness. The rehabilitation is most likely to be permitted if the discrediting evidence by Dent was testimony that
826	While walking home one evening, Harold, an off-duty police officer, was accosted by Jones, a stranger. Jones had been drinking and mistakenly thought Harold was a man who was having an affair with his wife. Intending to frighten Harold but not to harm him, Jones pulled out a knife, screamed obscenities, and told Harold he was going to kill him. Frightened and reasonably believing Jones was going to kill him and that using deadly force was his only salvation, Harold took out his service revolver and shot and killed Jones. Harold is charged with murder. Harold's claim of self-defense should be
827	A small business owner decided to retire, so she offered her long-time employee a chance to buy the business for $1 million. She promised in writing to keep the offer open to him for 90 days and to give him enough time to secure financing once he accepted the offer. Over the next few days, the employee cashed out all his retirement accounts and took a second mortgage on his home to raise the funds to purchase the business. When he approached the business owner to discuss the details of the sale, she said that she changed her mind and was revoking her offer because she did not want to retire after all. Was the owner's revocation of her offer proper?
828	A widget manufacturer entered into a written agreement with a retailer to sell the retailer 500 widgets for a total price of $10,000. Prior to the date set for execution of the contract, the price of the raw material essential to manufacture of widgets had soared because of a civil war in the country that produces 80% of the world supply of the material. The manufacturer informed the retailer that it would now cost $11,000 to manufacture the widgets and requested that the contract price be adjusted to $12,000 for the 500 widgets. The retailer agreed orally to pay the $12,000, but no written confirmation was exchanged between the parties. Shortly thereafter, the civil war ended and the raw material became available again at prewar price levels. The manufacturer shipped 500 widgets to the retailer. On receipt, the retailer sent the manufacturer a certified check in the amount of $10,000, marking it "payment in full." The manufacturer did not cash the check, but telephoned the retailer demanding an additional $2,000. The retailer refuses to pay the additional sum. May the manufacturer enforce his demand for an additional $2,000 in a court of law?
829	Suspecting that students in a dormitory were using narcotics, the president of a private college arranged for local police to place concealed microphones in several suites of the dormitory. Using these microphones, the college security officers recorded a conversation in which Green, a student, offered to sell marijuana to another student. The tape was turned over to the local police, who played it for a local judge. The judge issued a warrant to search Green's room. The room was searched by police, and marijuana was discovered. Green is charged with unlawful possession of narcotics. At trial, Green's motion to prevent the introduction of the marijuana into evidence will most probably be
830	The owner of a used car dealership and his business had been under investigation by the IRS for several months because of suspected fraudulent tax returns. In addition, a police detective who had been investigating a stolen car ring uncovered evidence indicating that the car dealer might be a part of the ring. The detective went to the car lot and found evidence indicating that the ring was operating through there. The car dealer then agreed to accompany the detective to the station to make a statement on the evidence. On the way he voluntarily informed the detective about the fraudulently filed tax returns, because he believed that by revealing these facts he might receive a lighter sentence for his involvement in the stolen car ring. At his trial for filing false tax returns, the car dealer's attorney moved to exclude the statement he made. The best argument for admitting the statement is that:
831	Following their divorce, the plaintiff and defendant were engaged in a bitter custody battle over their two children. The plaintiff is seeking to testify as to statements made by the defendant prior to the divorce in which she had told him that she did not feel that she could properly care for the children by herself. The defendant objects, alleging that the statements are privileged as a confidential communication made during the marriage. The court should find that the statements are:
832	Suffering from painful and terminal cancer, Willa persuaded Harold, her husband, to kill her to end her misery. As they reminisced about their life together and reaffirmed their love for each other, Harold tried to discourage Willa from giving up. Willa insisted, however, and finally Harold held a gun to her head and killed her. The most serious degree of criminal homicide of which Harold can be legally convicted is
833	An issue in the plaintiff's action against the defendant for causing the plaintiff's back injury was whether the plaintiff's condition had resulted principally from a similar occurrence five years before, with which the defendant had no connection. The plaintiff called as a witness his treating physician, who offered to testify that when she saw the plaintiff after the latest occurrence, the plaintiff told her that before the accident he had been working full-time, without pain or limitation of motion, in a job that involved lifting heavy boxes. The physician's testimony should be:
834	During a shooting at the scene of a robbery, a police officer was shot and killed. The city's police department announced a reward of $10,000 for information leading to the arrest of the individual who caused the death of the police officer. The next year, the police department made a public announcement repealing its reward offer. One month later, a man confessed to a local bartender of having committed the shooting. The bartender reported the information to the police and the man was arrested and ultimately convicted of the robbery and shooting. A friend suggested to the bartender that he claim the police department's $10,000 reward, of which he had been previously unaware. The bartender immediately made the claim but the police department refuses to pay him. If the bartender sues the city to recover the $10,000 reward, which of the following would be most helpful to him?
835	Congress adopted legislation prohibiting the federal courts from ordering busing as a remedy for past racial discrimination in a public school district. Which of the following is the strongest argument that the federal legislation is unconstitutional?
836	A state legislature recently enacted a statute imposing a "land utilization tax" on those operating businesses within the state who pay no property taxes. The state seeks to apply the tax to the owner of a small restaurant and store that is located in a national park within the state. The owner operates the restaurant and store pursuant to a contract with the United States Government and pays no property taxes. Which of the following is the owner's best constitutional argument against application of the tax to her?
837	A rancher entered into a written contract to buy a farm from a farmer for $100,000. The contract stipulated for closing on September 30. In addition, the contract contained the following provision: "The taxes shall be prorated as agreed to by the parties at a later date." Upon the signing of the contract, the rancher gave the farmer a check for $10,000 as a down payment. On September 28, the rancher notified the farmer that he would not be able to close on the farm until October 2, because the closing on his current home, the proceeds from which were to be applied to his purchase of the farm, was unavoidably delayed due to his buyer's illness. Meanwhile, the farmer had difficulty finding a home she liked as well as the farm. She decided that she would rather not sell the farm and wished to avoid the contract with the rancher. On October 2, the rancher showed up at the closing with the $90,000 to tender to the farmer. The farmer did not show up. The rancher sues for specific performance. The court will most likely rule in favor of:
838	A drug dealer was persuaded by his public defender to plead guilty to possession of marijuana, even though the drug dealer believed that the seizure of the marijuana was illegal. He pleaded guilty while protesting that he was innocent. The judge accepted the plea after determining that it was voluntary and intelligent. After the drug dealer was released on bail prior to sentencing, he was advised by a civil attorney that he could sue the arresting police officer to recover damages for an illegal search and seizure of the marijuana. Is the civil attorney correct?
839	A housecleaning agency was given a key to a customer's house so that the agency could have its employees clean while the homeowner was away. After a maid sent by the agency had finished and left the homeowner's house, she went back because she had forgotten her cigarettes. She neglected to lock the door when she left the second time because she was already late for the next job. When the homeowner returned after a few days away, she discovered that her house had been ransacked and several items of jewelry stolen. The front door was open, and there were no signs of forced entry. If the homeowner brings an action against the agency that employed the maid, she likely will:
840	Owen, the owner of Greenacre, a tract of land, mortgaged Greenacre to ABC Bank to secure his preexisting obligation to ABC Bank. The mortgage was promptly and properly recorded. Owen and Newton then entered into a valid written contract for the purchase and sale of Greenacre, which provided for the transfer of "a marketable title, free of encumbrances." The contract did not expressly refer to the mortgage. Shortly after entering into the contract, Newton found another property that much better suited her needs and decided to try to avoid her contract with Owen. When Newton discovered the existence of the mortgage, she asserted that the title was encumbered and that she would not close. Owen responded by offering to provide for payment and discharge of the mortgage at the closing from the proceeds of the closing. Newton refused to go forward, and Owen brought an appropriate action against her for specific performance. If the court holds for Owen in this action, it will most likely be because
841	In an action brought against Driver by Walker's legal representative, the only proofs that the legal representative offered on liability were that: (1) Walker, a pedestrian, was killed instantly while walking on the shoulder of the highway; (2) Driver was driving the car that struck Walker; and (3) there were no living witnesses to the accident other than Driver, who denied negligence. Assume the jurisdiction has adopted a rule of pure comparative negligence. If, at the end of the plaintiffs case, Driver moves for a directed verdict, the trial judge should
842	A landowner conveyed his land "to my son for life, then to my son's widow for her life, then to my son's children." At the time of the conveyance, the son was 20 years old and unmarried. The son eventually married and had two children, the landowner's grandson and granddaughter. Many years later, the landowner and the grandson were involved in a train accident. The landowner was killed instantly. The grandson died a short time later of his injuries. The landowner left his entire estate by will to his friend. The grandson's will devised his entire estate to the city zoo. The son's wife was so grief-stricken that she became ill and died the next year, leaving her entire estate to her husband. Eventually the son met and married a 21-yearold. Ten years later, the son died, leaving everything to his second wife. When the second wife moved onto the land, the granddaughter filed suit to quiet title to the land, joining all of the appropriate parties. If the jurisdiction recognizes the common law Rule Against Perpetuities, unmodified by statute, the court will most likely find that title to the land is held:
843	A defendant was convicted in federal court of possession of one kilogram of heroin with intent to distribute. She was sentenced to a prison term. Subsequently, the defendant was indicted by a federal grand jury for conspiracy to distribute the same kilogram of heroin. She moved to dismiss the indictment. Her motion should be:
844	As a result of a personal injury lawsuit, a victim obtained a judgment against a tortfeasor for $100,000. The tortfeasor, who had few assets, did not pay the judgment. On April 1 of the following year, the tortfeasor inherited a parcel of land from her uncle. On May 1, the tortfeasor entered into a contract with a buyer to sell the land for $120,000. The contract was not recorded. The buyer immediately applied to a bank for a loan of $100,000. The bank approved the buyer's loan, and on May 15, a closing was held. The tortfeasor deeded the land to the buyer, and the buyer executed a mortgage for $100,000 to the bank. Due to an error by the title company, the deed from the tortfeasor to the buyer was not recorded, although the mortgage to the bank was recorded. Neither the buyer nor the bank had any knowledge of the victim's judgment. On May 20, the victim recorded his judgment in the county recorder's office where the land was located. At that time, he had no knowledge of the buyer's or the bank's rights. When he learned about them, he immediately brought a proceeding to foreclose his judgment lien, naming the tortfeasor, the buyer, and the bank as parties. The jurisdiction has a typical grantor/grantee recording index, and has enacted the following statute: Any judgment properly filed in the county recorder's office shall, for 10 years from filing, be a lien on the real property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person against whom the judgment is rendered. No conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent bona fide purchasers for value and without notice unless the same be recorded according to law. As between the victim and the bank, which party's interest in the land will be given priority?
845	When Esther, Gray's 21-year-old daughter, finished college, Gray handed her a signed memorandum stating that if she would go to law school for three academic years, he would pay her tuition, room, and board and would "give her a $1,000 bonus" for each "A" she got in law school. Esther's uncle, Miller, who was present on this occasion, read the memorandum and thereupon said to Esther, "and if he doesn't pay your expenses, I will." Gray paid her tuition, room, and board for her first year but died just before the end of that year. Subsequently, Esther learned that she had received two "A's" in the second semester. The executor of Gray's estate has refused to pay her anything for the two "A's" and has told her that the estate will no longer pay her tuition, room, and board in law school. In an action against Gray's estate for $2,000 on account of the two "A's," if the only defense raised is lack of consideration, Esther probably will
846	Mrs. Dennis' 12-year-old daughter, Gala, had some difficulty getting along with other children in the neighborhood, especially with the younger ones. Thinking the experience would be good for her. Mrs. Dennis recommended Gala to Mr. Parrent as a baby-sitter for his five-year-old boy, Robby, but did not mention Gala's difficulties or her lack of prior experience as a babysitter. The Dennises and the Parrents were longstanding social acquaintances. On the evening Gala was to sit, the Parrents told Gala that she should treat Robby firmly, but that it would be preferable not to spank him since he did not take kindly to it. They did not tell Gala they had experienced trouble retaining baby-sitters because of Robby's temper tantrums. Later in the evening when Robby became angry upon being told to go to his room for being naughty. Gala spanked him, but only moderately hard. Robby then threw a hardbacked book at Gala, hitting her in the eye. As Gala tried to catch Robby to take him to his room, Robby fled around the house and out the back door, knocking over and breaking an expensive lamp. The back yard was completely dark. Gala heard Robby screaming and banging at the back door, which had closed and locked automatically, but she did nothing. After twenty minutes had passed, she heard a banging and crying at the front door, but still she did nothing. Then the noise stopped. In a few minutes Gala went outside and found Robby lying on the steps unconscious and injured. If a claim is asserted on behalf of Robby against Mrs. Dennis for damages based on Gala's conduct, Mrs. Dennis will probably be liable. because
847	Fernwood Realty Company developed a residential development, known as the Fernwood Development, which included single-family dwellings, townhouses, and high-rise apartments for a total of 25,000 dwelling units. Included in the deed to each unit was a covenant under which the grantee and the grantee's "heirs and assigns" agreed to purchase electrical power from only a plant Fernwood promised to build and maintain within the development. Fernwood constructed the plant and the necessary power lines. The plant did not supply power outside the development. An appropriate and fair formula was used to determine price. After constructing and selling 12,500 of the units, Fernwood sold its interest in the development to Gaint Realty Investors. Gaint operated the power plant and constructed and sold the remaining 12,500 units. Each conveyance from Gaint contained the same covenant relating to electrical power that Fernwood had included in the 12,500 conveyances it had made. Page bought a dwelling unit from Olm, who had purchased it from Fernwood. Subsequently, Page, whose lot was along the boundary of the Fernwood Development, ceased buying electrical power from Gaint and began purchasing power from General Power Company, which provided such service in the area surrounding the Fernwood Development. Both General Power and Gaint have governmental authorization to provide electrical services to the area. Gaint instituted an appropriate action against Page to enjoin her from obtaining electrical power from General Power. If judgment is for Page, it most likely will be because
848	On January 15, in a signed writing, Artisan agreed to remodel Ohner's building according to certain specifications, Ohner to pay the agreed price of $5,000 to Artisan's niece, Roberta Neese, as a birthday present. Neese did not learn of the agreement until her birthday on May 5. Before they signed the writing, Artisan and Ohner had orally agreed that their "written agreement will be null and void unless Ohner is able to obtain a $5,000 loan from the First National Bank before January 31." For this question only, assume that Ohner obtained the loan, that Artisan completed the remodeling on May 1, and that on May 3, at Artisan's request, Ohner paid the $5,000 to Artisan. If Neese learns of Ohner's payment to Artisan on May 5, at the same time she learns of the written Artisan-Ohner contract, will she succeed in an action against Ohner for $5,000?
849	A landlord heard that a company was looking for old buildings to purchase and raze to make room for new development. On July 1, the landlord sent a letter to the company stating, "I own two adjacent apartment buildings that might meet your needs. One is located on 123 Main Street and the other property is right behind it on 123 Wood Street. I will sell you one or both of the apartment buildings for $250,000 each. This offer remains open until August 1." On July 15, the company faxed the landlord, "Accept your offer with respect to the apartment building on Main Street." On July 18, the company faxed the landlord, "Will also take the building on Wood Street." On July 22, the landlord discovered that he did not have good title to the Wood Street property. Which of the following would provide the best legal support to the landlord's contention that he was not liable for breach of contract as to the Wood Street property?
850	Seth owned a vacant lot known as Richacre. Seth entered into a written contract with Bob to build a house of stated specifications on Richacre and to sell the house and lot to Bob. The contract provided for an "inside date" of April 1, 1977, and an "outside date" of May 1, 1977, for completion of the house and delivery of a deed. Neither party tendered performance on the dates stated. On May 3, 1977, Bob notified Seth in writing of Bob's election to cancel the contract because of Seth's failure to deliver title by May 1. On May 12, Seth notified Bob that some unanticipated construction difficulties had been encountered but that Seth was entitled to a reasonable time to complete in any event. The notification also included a promise that Seth would be ready to perform by May 29 and that he was setting that date as an adjourned closing date. Seth obtained a certificate of occupancy and appropriate documents of title, and he tendered performance on May 29. Bob refused. Seth brought an action to recover damages for breach of contract. The decision in the case will most likely be determined by whether
851	A man asked the owner of an old pickup truck if he could borrow it to haul some firewood, and the owner agreed. Shortly after the man picked up the truck from its owner, the owner remembered that the truck's steering had been damaged and was very sluggish, so he called the man's wife and told her to tell the man about it. The man ran several errands and arrived home with the truck a couple of hours later. His wife forgot to mention the phone call. Later, while the man was driving the truck filled with firewood, the steering did not respond on a curve and the man hit a tree. If the truck's steering had not been damaged, the man would not have hit the tree. If the man asserts a claim for personal injuries against the owner of the truck, who is likely to prevail?
852	An owner leased her studio to a photographer under a written lease for a term of five years at $1,250 per month. The lease provided that the photographer was prohibited from assigning or subletting without the owner's consent. Later, the photographer sold all his rights under the lease to an artist. The owner executed a signed writing consenting to the assignment of the photographer's interest to the artist. The deal went through. Subsequently, the owner sold the studio to an investor. A few months later, the artist transferred her interest under the lease to a pottery maker by a writing providing that the artist could reenter if the pottery maker failed to make rental payments to the investor. The investor, however, refused to consent to the pottery maker's becoming a tenant. As a result, the pottery maker refused to pay any rent. The transfer from the artist to the pottery maker was:
853	A landowner orally agreed to sell 100 acres of land to a buyer for $10,000. As a condition of the sale, the buyer agreed to pay $5,000 of the purchase price to the landowner's creditor. The buyer's attorney drafted the contract, which both the landowner and the buyer read before signing. The signed document made no reference to the payment to the landowner's creditor, and neither party noticed the oversight. Which of the following would be most important for deciding the creditor's action against the buyer for $5,000?
854	A man purchased a large flat screen plasma television and decided to mount it on the ceiling over his bed. The manual that came with the product included detailed instructions and illustrations on how to mount the television on different types of walls, along with all the required hardware, but contained neither instructions nor warnings regarding mounting on the ceiling. The man carefully followed the wallmounting instructions and was satisfied that it would hold. In fact, however, the mounting was not appropriate for ceilings. The next night, a woman who was the man's overnight guest was seriously injured when the television came loose and fell on the bed. Will the woman prevail in a suit against the company that manufactured the television?
855	A golfer and her instructor were playing golf in a foursome when the golfer became very annoyed with critical comments made by the instructor. To show the other golfers in the group how annoyed she was with her instructor, the golfer stood a few yards behind him while the instructor was teeing off and swung a club at him. The instructor, who was focusing on his shot, was not within range of the club but unfortunately the club slipped out of the golfer's hands and struck the instructor in the head, injuring him. If the instructor brings a battery action against the golfer, will he recover?
856	A homeowner who was worried about a series of burglaries in her neighborhood purchased a gun for protection. That evening, a homeless person trying to get out of the cold entered her garage through an unlocked door. The homeowner heard him as he was rummaging around for some blankets and opened the door to the garage with her gun in hand. Pointing it in his direction in an attempt to frighten him away, she shouted, "Get out or I'll shoot!" and fired what she thought was a warning shot into the ceiling. Unfortunately, her aim was bad and a bullet struck the homeless person in the shoulder. If the homeless person sues the homeowner for battery, her best defense is:
857	At a time when Ogawa held Lot 1 in the Fairoaks subdivision in fee simple, Vine executed a warranty deed that recited that Vine conveyed Lot 1, Fairoaks, to Purvis. The deed was promptly and duly recorded. After the recording of the deed from Vine to Purvis, Ogawa conveyed Lot I to Vine by a warranty deed that was promptly and duly recorded. Later, Vine conveyed the property to Rand by warranty deed and the deed was promptly and duly recorded. Rand paid the fair market value of Lot 1 and had no knowledge of any claim of Purvis. In an appropriate action, Rand and Purvis contest title to Lot 1. In this action, judgment should be for
858	A landowner executed a will, devising a parcel of land "to my sister for life, then to my brother for life, then to my nieces and nephews." When the landowner died, he was survived by the sister and the brother's son. The sister and the brother's son contracted to sell the land to a buyer for $225,000. At the time set for closing, the sister and the brother's son tendered a quitclaim deed to the buyer, who refused to complete the sale. The sister and the brother's son bring suit against the buyer for specific performance. The jurisdiction in which the land is located does not follow the Doctrine of Worthier Title. Specific performance will be:
859	In 1975, Utility constructed a new plant for the generation of electricity. The plant burns lignite, a low -grade fuel which is available in large quantities. Although the plant was constructed in accordance with the best practicable technology, the plant emits a substantial quantity of invisible fumes. The only way Utility can reduce the fumes is by the use of scrubbing equipment that would cost $50,000,000 to install and would increase the retail price of generated electricity by 50 per cent while reducing the volume of fumes by only 20 per cent. Because of the expense of such equipment and its relative ineffectiveness, no other generating plants burning lignite use such equipment. The plant was located in a sparsely settled rural area, remote from the large city served by Utility. Farmer owned a farm adjacent to the plant. He had farmed the land for forty years and lived on the premises. The prevailing winds carried fumes from tIe new plant over Farmer's land. His 1975 crop was less than half the average size of his crop over the five years immediately preceding the construction of the plant. It can be established that the fumes caused the crop reduction. Farmer's hay fever, from which he had long suffered, became worse in 1976. Physicians advised him that the lignite fumes were affecting it and that serious lung disease would soon result unless he moved away from the plant. He did so, selling his farm at its reasonable market value, which was then $10,000 less than before the construction of the plant. If Farmer asserts a claim based on negligence against Utility for crop damage, will Farmer prevail?
860	By her validly executed will, Sallie devised a certain tract of land to her son, Ben, for his life with remainder to such of Ben's children as should be living at his death, "Provided, however, that no such child of Ben shall mortgage or sell, or attempt to mortgage or sell, his or her interest in the property prior to attaining 25 years of age: and, if any such child of Ben shall violate this provision, then upon such violation his or her interest shall pass to and become the property of the remaining children of Ben then living, share and share alike." Sallie's will included an identical provision for each of her four other children concerning four other tracts of land. The residuary clause of the will gave the residuary estate to Sallie's five children equally. Sallie died and was survived by the five children named in her will and by eleven grandchildren. Several additional grandchildren have since been born. In an action for a declaration of rights, it was claimed that the attempted gifts to Sallie's grandchildren were entirely void and that the interests following the life estates to Sallie's children passed to the children absolutely by the residuary clause. Assuming that the action was properly brought with all necessary parties and with a guardian ad item appointed to represent the interests of unborn and infant grandchildren, the decision should be that
861	The Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") issued a lengthy set of regulations regarding personal radar detectors. The regulations deal with the safety of such detectors and the frequencies on which they may operate, so as not to interfere with FCC-licensed radio and television stations or with radar used by commercial airliners and private aircraft. May a state constitutionally ban the use of radar detectors on its roads?
862	To fight drug abuse, a state enacted a statute forbidding the selling of airplane glue to anyone under the age of 18 except in small quantities in prepackaged model kits. Violation of the statute was penalized by fines or, in cases of multiple violations, possible imprisonment. The statute also required that all elementary and secondary schools licensed by the state provide comprehensive drug education programs. Neither the legislature nor the courts of the state have abolished the common law tort defense of assumption of the risk. The owner of a hobby shop in the state sold a large tube of airplane glue to a 15-year-old boy who reasonably appeared to be at least 18 years old. The boy had received drug education in his school, as mandated by the statute, including coverage of the dangers of glue sniffing. The boy understood the anti-drug instruction, but he wanted to experience it for himself. The boy sniffed the glue repeatedly and suffered permanent brain damage. If the boy's parents file suit against the store owner, the court should find:
863	Plaintiff was a passenger in a car that was struck in the rear by a car driven by First. The collision resulted from First's negligence in failing to keep a proper lookout. Plaintiff's physician found that the collision had aggravated a mild osteoarthritic condition in her lower back and had brought on similar, but new, symptoms in her neck and upper back. Six months after the first accident, Plaintiff was a passenger in a car that was struck in the rear by a car driven by Second. The collision resulted from Second's negligence in failing to keep a proper lookout. Plaintiffs physician found that the second collision had caused a general worsening of Plaintiff's condition, marked by a significant restriction of movement and muscle spasms in her back and neck. The physician believes Plaintiff's worsened condition is permanent, and he can find no basis for apportioning responsibility for her present worsened condition between the two automobile collisions. Plaintiff brought an action for damages against First and Second. At the close of Plaintiff's evidence, as outlined above, each of the defendants moved for a directed verdict in his favor on the ground that Plaintiff had failed to produce evidence on which the jury could determine how much damage each defendant had caused. The jurisdiction adheres to the common-law rules regarding joint and several liability. Plaintiff's best argument in opposition to the defendants' motions would be that the defendants are jointly and severally liable for Plaintiff's entire harm, because
864	The Personnel Handbook of Green City contains all of that city's personnel policies. One section of the handbook states that "where feasible and practicable supervisors are encouraged to follow the procedures specified in this Handbook before discharging a city employee." Those specified procedures include a communication to the employee of the reasons for the contemplated discharge and an opportunity for a pretermination trial-type hearing at which the employee may challenge those reasons. After a year of service, Baker, the secretary to the Green City Council, was discharged without receiving any communication of reasons for her contemplated discharge and without receiving an opportunity for a pretermination trial-type hearing. Baker files suit in federal district court to challenge her discharge solely on constitutional grounds. Which of the following best describes the initial burden of persuasion in that suit?
865	Meadowview is a large tract of undeveloped land. Black, the owner of Meadowview, prepared a development plan creating 200 house lots in Meadowview with the necessary streets and public areas. The plan was fully approved by all necessary governmental agencies and duly recorded. However, construction of the streets, utilities, and other aspects of the development of Meadowview has not yet begun, and none of the streets can be opened as public ways until they are completed in accordance with the applicable ordinances of the municipality in which Meadowview is located. College Avenue, one of the streets laid out as part of the Meadowview development, abuts Whiteacre, an adjacent one-acre parcel owned by White. Whiteacre has no access to any public way except an old, poorly developed road which is inconvenient and cannot be used without great expense. White sold Whiteacre to Breyer. The description used in the deed from White to Breyer was the same as that used in prior deeds except that the portion of the description which formerly said, "thence by land of Black, north-easterly a distance of 200 feet, more or less," was changed to "thence by College Avenue as laid out on the Plan of Meadowview North 460 East 201.6 feet," with full reference to the plan and its recording data. Breyer now seeks a building permit which will show that Breyer intends to use College Avenue for access to Whiteacre. Black objects to the granting of a building permit on the grounds that he has never granted any rights to White or Breyer to use College Avenue. There are no governing statutes or ordinances relating to the problem. Black brings an appropriate action in which the right of Breyer to use College Avenue without an express grant from Black is at issue. The best argument for Black in this action is that
866	Kathy, a two-year-old, became ill with meningitis. Jim and Joan, her parents, were members of a group that believed fervently that if they prayed enough, God would not permit their child to die. Accordingly, they did not seek medical aid for Kathy and refused all offers of such aid. They prayed continuously. Kathy died of the illness within a week. Jim and Joan are charged with murder in a common-law jurisdiction. Their best defense to the charge is that
867	A landlord leased a 40-acre tract of land to a tenant for a 15-year period. After five years had expired, the government condemned 15 acres of the property for road construction and allocated the compensation award to the landlord and the tenant according to their respective interests. It so happened, however, that the tenant had used the 15 acres taken by the government to store vehicles necessary in the tenant's work. The tenant knew of no other place nearby where he could store the vehicles. There is no applicable statute in the jurisdiction where the property is located, nor any provision in the lease relating to the condemnation. The tenant quit possession, claiming that he could no longer live on the premises if he could not park the vehicles needed in his work close to where he lived. The landlord brought suit against the tenant to recover rent. The most likely result of this suit is that the landlord will:
868	A landowner advertised in the newspaper that he wished to sell 40 acres of land at $10,000 per acre. A rancher who was looking to expand his holdings was interested, so he came out to inspect the property. After the inspection, the rancher agreed to purchase the land for $400,000. A contract for the sale of the 40 acres was prepared and signed by the landowner and the rancher. The contract failed to state the purchase price. Later, the rancher had a change of heart and refused to complete the purchase. In the landowner's lawsuit for breach of contract, the court should hold for:
869	The defendant and two others were indicted on felony charges for electronic theft of bank accounts. During plea negotiations, the district attorney indicated that he would also charge the defendant with additional theft by computer offenses if the defendant insisted on going to trial, but that if he pleaded guilty to the one charge and agreed to testify against his co-defendants at their trial, the prosecution would recommend probation only. Because of the risk of jail time if he was convicted of any of the additional offenses, the defendant agreed. When the defendant appeared in court, the judge informed him of the nature of the charge and the potential punishment, and that the defendant was waiving his right to trial by pleading guilty. She asked if his plea was voluntary and he replied that it was the best deal that he could get, but that he was really innocent of the crime charged. The judge nevertheless accepted the plea, reserving sentencing until the defendant testified against his co-defendants. Just before trial of the defendant's co-defendants, they pleaded guilty and provided additional information of the defendant's central role in the crime and in additional computer theft offenses. At the defendant's sentencing, the prosecution introduced the testimony of the defendant's co-defendants and asked the judge to impose a jail term. The judge sentenced the defendant to five years in prison for the crime to which he pleaded guilty. Which of the following arguments provides a valid basis for vacating the defendant's guilty plea and sentence?
870	Storekeeper, the owner of a large hardware store, sells power saws for both personal and commercial use. He often takes old power saws as trade-ins on new ones. The old power saws are then completely disassembled and rebuilt with new bearings by Storekeeper's employees and sold by Storekeeper as "reconditioned saws. " Purchaser, the owner and operator of a cabinetmaking shop, informed Storekeeper that he wanted to buy a reconditioned circular saw for use in his cabinetmaking business. However, the blade that was on the saw he picked out had very coarse teeth for cutting rough lumber. Purchaser told Storekeeper that he wanted a saw blade that would cut plywood. Storekeeper exchanged the coarse blade for a new one with finer teeth that would cut plywood smoothly. The new blade was manufactured by Saw- Blade Company, which uses all available techniques to inspect its products for defects. The reconditioned saw had been manufactured by Power Saw Company. The week after the saw was purchased, Employee, who works for Purchaser in Purchaser's cabinetmaking shop, was injured while using the saw. Employee's arm was severely cut. As a result, the cabinetmaking shop was shut down for a week until a replacement for Employee could be found. If Employee was cutting a sheet of plywood, and while he was doing so, the saw blade flew to pieces and severely cut Employee's arm, and if.Employee asserts a claim against Storekeeper, the theory on which Employee is most likely to prevail is
871	A student broke into her professor's office to look at examination questions without taking them. Once in the office, the student was unable to locate the examination questions, as they were locked in a desk drawer. The student mistakenly believed that looking at examination questions was a felony in the jurisdiction; in fact, such conduct would be a misdemeanor at most. The jurisdiction includes offices as structures that could be burglarized. If the student were to be apprehended and charged with burglary, she should be:
872	Duncan was charged with aggravated assault. At trial Duncan did not testify; however, he sought to offer opinion evidence of his good character for truth and veracity. This testimony should be
873	A college student was interested in renting a particular apartment because of its very distinctive features, but she was also considering a number of other options. Because she wanted some time to make up her mind, she contacted the building's rental agent and asked him to reserve her right to rent the particular apartment. They made the following written agreement: Upon payment of $200, the student shall have the right to inform the agent that she wishes to rent the apartment any time on or before July 1. If she fails to notify the agent that she wants the apartment on or before July 1, the agent shall keep the $200. However, if she does notify the agent on or before July 1 that she desires the apartment, the agent will apply the $200 to her first month's rent. The student paid the agent $200. On June 9, the agent rented the apartment to a third party who was unaware of the agent's agreement with the student. On July 1, the student told the agent that she wanted the apartment. He refused to rent it to her and returned her $200. The student sued, requesting the court to compel the agent to rent her the apartment. The court determined that the agent breached his agreement with the student. Would it be appropriate for the court to order the agent to rent the apartment to the student?
874	A company let an employee borrow one of its company cars for a cross-country vacation trip which the employee had planned for his family. While driving through a remote stretch of farmland, the employee decided to see how much power the car really had, and was driving in excess of 90 m.p.h. when he came to a curve. He applied the brakes and attempted to slow down, but the car went across the double line and struck head-on a minivan coming in the opposite direction. The driver of the minivan was killed in the accident and the minivan was destroyed. A "permissive use" statute is in effect making the bailor of an automobile liable for personal injury, death, or property damage caused by any person operating the automobile with his consent, up to a maximum of $25,000. The jurisdiction follows traditional contribution rules. If the driver's estate files suit against the company pursuant to the "permissive use" statute, and recovers the full $25,000, what rights, if any, would the company have against the employee?
875	The defendant and her boyfriend went into a drugstore. While in the store, the defendant reached into the cash register and took out $200. The owner of the store came out of a back room, saw what had happened, and told the defendant to put the money back. The defendant's boyfriend then took a revolver from under his coat and shot and killed the store owner. The defendant claims that the store owner owed her $200 and that she went to the drugstore to try to collect the debt. She said that she asked her boyfriend to come along just in case the store owner made trouble, but that she did not plan on using any force and did not know that her boyfriend was armed. If the defendant is prosecuted for murder on the basis of felony murder and the jury believes her claim, she should be found:
876	A state statute made it unlawful to sell soft drink beverages in any type of container except refundable glass containers. A violation of the statute constituted a misdemeanor, subjecting the violator to a fine of up to $1,000. An out-of-state corporation manufacturing and selling aluminum soft drink cans in the above state brought suit in federal district court contesting the constitutionality of the statute as an undue burden on interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause. The court should:
877	A parent purchased for her teenage daughter a refurbished MP3 player from an online auction site. The seller of the player had purchased the MP3 player from a recycling center and reconditioned it with cheaper parts from a different manufacturer. One day while the teenager was listening to the MP3 player through its original headphones, the player shorted out and caused injury to the teenager's eardrum. If the teenager asserts a claim based on strict liability in tort against the MP3 player's manufacturer, the teenager will probably:
878	As part of a comprehensive federal aid-to-education program, Congress included the following provisions as conditions for state receipt of federal funds: (1) Whenever textbooks are provided to students without charge, they must include no religious instruction and must be made available on the same terms to students in all public and private schools accredited by the state educational authority. (2) Salary supplements can be paid to teachers in public and private schools, up to ten percent of existing salary schedules, where present compensation is less than the average salary for persons of comparable training and experience, provided that no such supplement is paid to any teacher who instructs in religious subjects. (3) Construction grants can be made toward the cost of physical plant at private colleges and universities, provided that no part of the ant is used for buildings in which instruction in religious subJect matters is offered. Federal taxpayer Bates also challenges the salary supplements for teachers in private schools where religious instruction is included. in the curriculum. On the substantive constitutional issue, the most likely result is that the salary supplements will be
879	A landowner operated a honey farm on her property adjacent to a busy state highway. The landowner had numerous hives for her honeybees that she carefully maintained and operated in compliance with all appropriate regulations. A motorist was driving his sports car on the highway at a high rate of speed after a rain shower when he lost control on the wet pavement. His car crossed in front of a motorcyclist who was going in the opposite direction, causing the motorcyclist to crash into a ditch on the side of the road. The motorist's car continued off the road onto the landowner's property and smashed into one of the beehives, driving an angry swarm of bees out of the hive. The motorcyclist, who suffered only a few bruises when his motorcycle crashed, saw the swarm of bees heading toward him and started to run across the road to get away from them. He stumbled and was struck by a truck, causing him to suffer several broken bones and serious internal injuries. Can the motorcyclist recover any damages from the landowner?
880	As part of a redevelopment plan, a developer purchased of land and constructed a condominium complex thereon. The deeds to each of the units prohibited any owner from (i) failing to occupy the unit as the owner's principal place of residence for any period, and (ii) leasing the unit at any time for any reason. The restrictions, which were also contained in the contracts that all owners signed, were designed to foster an owner-occupied environment in the redevelopment area. Subsequently, a current owner of a condo unit obtained a job transfer to another state. When he attempted to lease his unit to a friend, the condominium association filed an action for declaratory and injunctive relief. Should the court grant the injunction?
881	Able was the owner of Greenacre, a large tract of land. Able entered into a binding written contract with Baker for the sale and purchase of Greenacre for $125,000. The contract required Able to convey marketable record title. Baker decided to protect his interest and promptly and properly recorded the contract. Thereafter, but before the date scheduled for the closing, Charlie obtained and properly filed a final judgment against Able in the amount of $1 million in a personal injury suit. A statute in the jurisdiction provides: "Any judgment properly filed shall, for ten years from filing, be a lien on the real property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person against whom the judgment is rendered." The recording act of the jurisdiction authorizes recording of contracts and also provides: "No conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value and without notice unless the same be recorded according to law." There are no other relevant statutory provisions. At the closing, Baker declined to accept the title of Able on the ground that Charlie's judgment lien encumbered the title he would receive and rendered it unmarketable. Able brought an appropriate action against Baker for specific performance of the contract and joined Charlie as a party. In this action, the judgment should be for
882	Able, who owned Blackacre, a residential lot improved with a dwelling, conveyed it for a valuable consideration to Baker. The dwelling had been constructed by a prior owner. Baker had inspected Blackacre prior to the purchase and discovered no defects. After moving in, Baker became aware that sewage seeped into the basement when the toilets were flushed. Able said that this defect had been present for years and that he had taken no steps to hide the facts from Baker. Baker paid for the necessary repairs and brought an appropriate action against Able to recover his cost of repair. If Baker wins, it will be because
883	In a trial between Jones and Smith, an issue arose about Smith's ownership of a horse, which had caused damage to Jones's crops. Jones offered to testify that he looked up Smith's telephone number in the directory called that number, and that a voice answered, -This is Smith speaking," Atthis Jones asked, 'Was that your horse that tramped across my cornfield this afternoon?" The voice replied, 'Yes." The judge should rule the testimony
884	Storekeeper, the owner of a large hardware store, sells power saws for both personal and commercial use. He often takes old power saws as trade-ins on new ones. The old power saws are then completely disassembled and rebuilt with new bearings by Storekeeper's employees and sold by Storekeeper as "reconditioned saws. " Purchaser, the owner and operator of a cabinetmaking shop, informed Storekeeper that he wanted to buy a reconditioned circular saw for use in his cabinetmaking business. However, the blade that was on the saw he picked out had very coarse teeth for cutting rough lumber. Purchaser told Storekeeper that he wanted a saw blade that would cut plywood. Storekeeper exchanged the coarse blade for a new one with finer teeth that would cut plywood smoothly. The new blade was manufactured by Saw- Blade Company, which uses all available techniques to inspect its products for defects. The reconditioned saw had been manufactured by Power Saw Company. The week after the saw was purchased, Employee, who works for Purchaser in Purchaser's cabinetmaking shop, was injured while using the saw. Employee's arm was severely cut. As a result, the cabinetmaking shop was shut down for a week until a replacement for Employee could be found. If Employee was injured while cutting plywood when the shaft holding the saw blade came loose when a bearing gave way and the shaft and blade flew off the saw, and if Purchaser asserts a claim based on strict liability in tort against Storekeeper for loss of business because of the injury to Employee, Purchaser probably will
885	A plaintiff was injured when a portion of a spiral stairway in a shopping mall collapsed. The plaintiff filed suit against both the owners of the mall and the designers of the staircase. At the trial of the case, the plaintiff wishes to call a highly qualified civil engineer to the stand to testify as an expert witness. The expert is prepared to testify that the spiral staircase was improperly designed, and the design defect caused a portion of the staircase to collapse under the plaintiff. The expert's proposed testimony is based in part upon a series of photographs taken by a structural engineer hired by the expert immediately after the expert was engaged by the plaintiff's attorney, and the accompanying report by the structural engineer. It is customary for civil engineers to form professional opinions based on these reports. The photographs are of the collapsed stairway and of an identical stairway located in another part of the mall. Neither the photographs nor the report has been admitted into evidence, but the expert is willing to disclose to the jury the facts on which he relied in forming his opinion. The expert's testimony should be ruled:
886	To rein in states passing restrictive usury laws, Congress enacted legislation establishing a uniform usury rate. The legislation, in essence, establishes that the usury rate will be determined by the Federal Reserve Board on the date of the loan. The law is intended to be of great assistance to the private home market as well as the commercial market. One state has a usury law that permits the charging of interest in excess of that which Congress has provided. Mortgage lenders in that state brought an action in federal court seeking to void the federal law with respect to loans in the state. The lenders presented evidence that loans made in the state during the last two years for the purpose of housing all were at rates exceeding those permissible under the provision of the federal law. The lenders allege that enforcing the federal law would bring the housing industry to a stop. The federal judge should:
887	The defendant was arrested and charged with possession of illegal narcotics and placed on trial in a municipal court. The defendant demanded a jury trial, which was duly granted. After the jury had been sworn, selected, and impaneled, the defendant's attorney filed a motion with the presiding judge praying for a dismissal based on a technical error in the bill of information drawn up by the city prosecutor. No witnesses had yet been sworn at the time the attorney filed the motion. The judge ordered an immediate recess while he considered the motion. Two days later he ruled in favor of the defendant and dismissed the charges against him. A week later a state grand jury indicted the defendant for possession of illegal narcotics with intention to distribute same. The charges arose out of the same incident and arrest described above. The defendant was ordered to appear in the superior court of the state to answer the charges. The defendant's attorney immediately filed a motion on the defendant's behalf asserting that it would be unconstitutional to retry the defendant in the state court. The best argument against granting the motion is which of the following?
888	The President of the United States and the king of a foreign nation entered into a treaty agreeing that citizens of the foreign nation who reside in the United States would not be taxed by the United States and that United States citizens who reside in the foreign nation would not be taxed by it. The treaty was ratified by the United States Senate and the royal council of the foreign nation. One year after the treaty became effective, the foreign nation began to tax United States citizens within its borders. The President immediately declared the tax treaty to be void and ordered the Internal Revenue Service to tax citizens of the foreign nation living in the United States. Is the President's action constitutional?
889	While Defendant was in jail on a procuring charge, his landlord called the police because rent had not been paid and because he detected a disagreeable odor coming from Defendant's apartment into the hallways. The police officer who responded to the call knew that Defendant was in jail. He recognized the stench coming from Defendant's apartment as that of decomposing flesh and, without waiting to obtain a warrant and using the landlord's passkey, entered the apartment with the landlord's consent. The lease to these premises gave the landlord a right of entry, at any reasonable hour, for the purpose of making repairs. The police officer found a large trunk in the bedroom which seemed to be the source of the odor. Upon breaking it open, he found the remains of Rosette, Defendant's former mistress. The landlord's consent to the police officer's search of Defendant's apartment is
890	A woman entered into a written lease with the owner of a condominium unit. Under the terms of the condominium building's bylaws, no pets were permitted in any of the units. Thus, a "no pet" clause was contained in the woman's lease. A few months later, the condominium unit's owner died, leaving his entire estate to his sister. Several days before his death, the woman had assigned her lease to a young couple by written agreement. The woman failed to properly state that no pets were permitted in the building. The couple became very upset on learning of the pet prohibition and abandoned the unit. Can the sister bring a suit against the woman for this breach of the lease?
891	A plaintiff brought suit against a manufacturing company, seeking to recover for damages he suffered when his car's engine burst into flames following the use of an engine additive made by the company. The plaintiff contends that the manufacturing company was negligent and in breach of warranty. An automobile engineer sat in court while the plaintiff testified to the events concerning the engine fire. The plaintiff's testimony was not challenged or rebutted. The plaintiff calls the engineer to the stand and asks him whether, based on the plaintiff's prior testimony, it was possible for a car engine to burst into flames as it did. The engineer's testimony would be:
892	In answer to a radio advertisement, a teenager two months shy of his 18th birthday contracted to buy a late model car from a car dealership. The agreement required a $1,500 down payment with the remainder of the $7,200 price to be paid in monthly installments to a local finance company. The teenager's first eight payments were made regularly until his driver's license was suspended. He then informed the company that no further payments would be forthcoming. The finance company sued for the remaining payments. The age of majority in the teenager's state is 18 years. Would the teenager be liable for the balance of the payments?
893	Acting on a hunch, a police officer went to a young woman's apartment, broke in, and searched it. The officer found exactly what she was looking for under the woman's bed: a sack filled with jewels. The attached note read, "Sweetheart, here are the goods from the estate heist. Your loving boyfriend." It was well known in the community that the woman's boyfriend was a jewel thief. The officer also knew that the estate of a local socialite had been burglarized three days ago. Just as the officer finished reading the note, the woman returned. The officer immediately placed the woman under arrest as an accessory to the estate burglary. Based on the evidence obtained from the woman's apartment, a search warrant was issued for her boyfriend's apartment. The search yielded burglar tools and more jewels from the estate. The boyfriend was immediately arrested and charged with the estate burglary. At the boyfriend's trial for the estate burglary, his attorney files a motion to suppress the evidence consisting of the bag of jewels and note, the tools, and the jewels from the boyfriend's apartment. The court should:
894	Kelly County, in the state of Green, is located adjacent to the border of the state of Red. The communities located in Kelly County are principally suburbs of Scarletville, a large city located in Red, and therefore there is a large volume of traffic between that city and Kelly County. While most of that traffic is by private passenger automobiles, some of it is by taxicabs and other kinds of commercial vehicles. An ordinance of Kelly County, the stated purpose of which is to reduce traffic congestion, provides that only taxicabs registered in Kelly County may pick up or discharge passengers in the county. The ordinance also provides that only residents of Kelly County may register taxicabs in that county. Which of the following is the proper result in a suit brought by Scarletville taxicab owners challenging the constitutionality of this Kelly County ordinance?
895	The wife of the president of a small but prestigious private college was also an instructor at the college. While researching an article about the college president, a reporter discovered and revealed in a published news story that while the wife was dating the president, she had falsified her academic credentials on her application for a position with the college. As a result of the news story, the wife was subject to verbal attacks and innuendo among her colleagues. She asserted a cause of action against the newspaper for defamation and established at trial that the story about her was not accurate. For the wife to prevail, she also will need to show that:
896	A husband and wife were going through a nasty divorce. The wife hired a private detective to spy on her husband. The detective followed the husband to a hotel, where he saw the husband meet a woman and go into her hotel room. The detective checked into the adjoining room, placed an electronic listening device on the wall, and listened to and recorded the activities of the husband and the woman in the next room. He did nothing with the information he gathered, however, because the wife's retainer check to the detective bounced. Both adultery and electronic eavesdropping are crimes under state law. If the husband sues the detective for invasion of privacy:
897	During 1976 a series of arsons, one of which damaged the Humongous Store, occurred in the City of Swelter. In early 1977 Swelter's City Council adopted this resolution: The City will pay $10,000 for the arrest and conviction of anyone guilty of any of the 1976 arsons committed here. The foregoing was telecast by the city's sole television station once daily for one week. Subsequently, Humongous, by a written memorandum to Gimlet, a private detective, proposed to pay Gimlet $200 "for each day 's work you actually perform in investigating our fire." Thereafter, in August, 1977, the City Council by resolution repealed its reward offer and caused this resolution to be broadcast once daily for a week over two local radio stations, the local television station having meanwhile ceased operations. In September, 1977, a Humongous employee voluntarily confessed to Gimlet to having committed all of the 1976 arsons. Humongous' president thereupon paid Gimlet at the proposed daily rate for his investigation and suggested that Gimlet also claim the city's reward, of which Gimlet had been previously unaware. Gimlet immediately made the claim. In December, 1977, as a result of Gimlet's investigation, the Humongous employee was convicted of burning the store. The city, which has no immunity to suit, has since refused to pay Gimlet anything, although he swears that he never heard of the city's repealer before claiming its reward. If the city's reward offer was revocable, revocation could be effectively accomplished only
898	Police were concerned about an increase in marijuana traffic in Defendant's neighborhood. One night, Police Officers, accompanied by dogs trained to sniff out marijuana, went into the back yard of Defendant's house and onto his porch. Defendant and his friend were inside having dinner The dogs acted as if they smelled marijuana. Police Officers knocked on the back door. Defendant answered the door and let them in. Defendant was immediately placed under arrest. After a brief search, Police Officers confiscated a large quantity of marijuana which they found in Defendant's linen closet. Defendant's motion to prevent introduction of the marijuana into evidence will most probably be
899	A professional painter and his apprentice, in business as a partnership, were hired to paint a store. Midway through the job they ran out of paint, so the painter lent his truck to the apprentice to pick up more. On his way to pick up the paint, the apprentice stopped at a post office along the way to mail a personal letter. On pulling out of the post office parking lot, he negligently ran into a parked car, causing extensive damage. If the car owner brings a negligence action against the painter, will she prevail?
900	A store sold office equipment and supplies to various businesses in the area. The store entered into a written agreement with an electronics company to purchase all of its monthly requirements of printers for a period of five years at a specified unit price. The agreement contained a nonassignment clause. Shortly thereafter, the electronics company assigned the contract to a finance company as security for a loan. The store subsequently ordered the printers from the electronics company and paid the electronics company the agreed price for the printers for the first month of the agreement. Which of the following accurately states the legal effect of the covenant not to assign the contract?
901	Seisin and Vendee, standing on Greenacre, orally agreed to its sale and purchase for $5,000, and orally marked its bounds as "that line of trees down there, the ditch that intersects them, the fence on the other side, and that street on the fourth side." In which of the following is the remedy of reformation most appropriate?
902	A gas company offered a generous sum to a landowner in exchange for permission to run pipes over a 15-foot strip of the landowner's property to supply natural gas to a new housing development. The landowner granted the gas company and its "heirs and assigns" an easement over the 15-foot strip of property "for pipeline purposes." The easement was duly recorded. When the housing development was ready for utility services, the gas company laid the pipe across the 15-foot strip of property. Shortly after the gas company finished laying its pipe, the landowner planted a garden of trees and flowers on the 15-foot strip. For the next 10 years, the gas company supplied natural gas to the housing development through that pipe. When the gas company no longer needed the lines that ran across the property, it sold its rights in the easement to an oil company that wished to run a crude oil pipeline across the same strip of property. Now, although the oil company confined its activities to the strip, it drove trucks onto the land, uprooted the trees, and tore up the flower garden in order to excavate for the laying of a larger pipe than the gas company had installed. The landowner filed suit to enjoin the oil company from further activities on the 15-foot strip and for damages for the destruction wrought on his property. Is the landowner likely to succeed in this suit?
903	A husband discovered his wife in bed with a neighbor. The neighbor ran out the back door. The husband screamed at his wife and vowed revenge. After consuming several drinks to build up his nerve and becoming intoxicated, the husband went to his friend's house and borrowed a gun, and then went to the neighbor's house. The neighbor had neglected to lock his front door, so the husband walked in. He found the neighbor trembling in the living room and pointed the gun at him. The neighbor immediately began apologizing and pleading for his life, but then suddenly he pulled a switchblade knife from his pocket. As the metal flashed, the husband fired a single shot at the neighbor, killing him. The husband can be convicted of:
904	In Peel's personal injury action, Wilson, a physician who had no previous knowledge of the matter, sat in court and heard all of the evidence about Peel's symptoms and conditions. Wilson is called to give her opinion whether Peel's injuries are permanent. May Wilson so testify?
905	Dominique obtained a bid of $10,000 to tear down her old building and another bid of $90,000 to replace it with a new structure in which she planned to operate a sporting goods store. Having only limited cash available, Dominique asked Hardcash for a $100,000 loan. After reviewing the plans for the project, Hardcash in a signed writing promised to lend Dominique $100,000 secured by a mortgage on the property and repayable over ten years in equal monthly installments at 10% annual interest. Dominique promptly accepted the demolition bid and the old building was removed, but Hardcash thereafter refused to make the loan. Despite diligent efforts, Dominique was unable to obtain a loan from any other source. Does Dominique have a cause of action against Hardcash?
906	A licensed real estate broker and a homeowner entered into a written listing agreement in which the homeowner promised, among other things, to pay the real estate broker a 6% commission of the selling price of the homeowner's home if the real estate broker obtained a buyer ready, willing, and able to purchase it. The homeowner's home was listed for $180,000 in a service made available to real estate professionals. A prospective buyer, after going to the real estate broker's office and viewing the homeowner's home, submitted a written offer to purchase the home for $180,000. The homeowner rejected this offer by not accepting it within the stated period. The buyer brings an action against the homeowner for specific performance, seeking to compel him to sell the home. What is the probable outcome of this litigation?
907	In a contract action between the plaintiff and the defendant, brought in federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction, the major issue is the value of a parcel of land. The plaintiff's attorney calls a realtor to the stand and qualifies her as an expert on property valuation. Since the realtor had not personally inspected the property, the plaintiff's attorney was prepared to ask the realtor a hypothetical question based on evidence adduced at the trial. However, the trial had already dragged on longer than expected, and to save time, the plaintiff's attorney merely asks the realtor, "In your expert opinion, how much is the land worth?" The defendant's attorney objects. The objection should be:
908	The governor of the state of Green proposes to place a Christmas nativity scene, the components of which would be permanently donated to the state by private citizens, in the Green Capitol Building rotunda where the Green Legislature meets annually. The governor further proposes to display this state- owned nativity scene annually from December 1 to December 31, next to permanent displays that depict the various products manufactured in Green. The governor's proposal is supported by all members of both houses of the legislature. If challenged in a lawsuit on establishment clause grounds, the proposed nativity scene display would be held
909	Eight years ago, Orben, prior to moving to a distant city, conveyed Blackacre, an isolated farm, to his son, Sam, by a quitclaim deed. Sam paid no consideration. Sam, who was 19 years old, without formal education, and without experience in business, took possession of Blackacre and operated the farm but neglected to record his deed. Subsequently, Orben conveyed Blackacre to Fred by warranty deed. Fred, a substantial land and timber promoter, paid valuable consideration for the deed to him. He was unaware of Sam's possession, his quitclaim deed, or his relationship to Orben. Fred promptly and properly recorded his deed and began removing timber from the land. Immediately upon learning of Fred's actions, Sam recorded his deed and brought an appropriate action to enjoin Fred from removing the timber and to quiet title in Sam. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides: "No conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value and without notice unless the same be recorded according to law." In this action, Fred should
910	The state legislature enacted a statute authorizing all state agencies having legal departments or employing lawyers to subscribe to a specific computerized legal research service provided by a legal research corporation. A contract was duly entered into between the state and the corporation. Before the corporation could begin installing the necessary equipment in state offices, it was revealed that the state university system had exhausted its budgeted resources and would not be able to operate without additional money. The legislature then repealed the statute authorizing use of the computer legal service and reallocated these funds to the university. In an action by the corporation against the state to enforce the contract, the trial court should rule that the repealed statute is:
911	A merchant had a serious cash flow problem and needed cash to buy the inventory required to fill orders. A friend offered to loan the merchant $50,000 if he would put up adequate collateral to assure her that she would not lose her money. To guarantee the loan, the merchant gave the friend a deed to a property worth $100,000 that he had inherited. The friend recorded the deed. The friend gave the merchant $50,000, and the merchant signed a promissory note agreeing to repay the $50,000 within eight months. The merchant continued to occupy the property, and the friend agreed to reconvey the property to the merchant as soon as he repaid the $50,000. The merchant was unable to pay the friend when the note came due. He asked the friend for an extension, but she refused. If the friend seeks to take possession of the property, may she do so?
912	A state passed a law requiring that anyone holding himself out to be a private investigator in the state must be licensed by the state. Licensure requirements included a thorough background check into the person's criminal record and mental health. It also required passing a test on ethical obligations of a private investigator. Finally, the investigator was required to sign a two-part oath. Part one was a loyalty oath, which stated: "I solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will be loyal to the United States and to the state and will uphold their Constitutions." Part two stated: "I solemnly swear (or affirm) that I am not now a member of any organization that advocates illegal acts, nor will I become a member of any such organization while I am a licensed private investigator in this state." An experienced investigator with a master's degree in criminal justice administration applied for a private investigator's license. He easily passed both background checks, but he refused to take the oaths, claiming that they inhibited his freedoms of speech and association as guaranteed by the federal Constitution. The state professional licensure board denied him a private investigator's license solely on the basis of his refusal to take the oaths. The investigator sued in federal court to require the state to grant him a license and to strike down the oath requirements in the licensure statute. The court is likely to find that:
913	Statutes in the jurisdiction define criminal assault as "an attempt to commit a criminal battery" and criminal battery as "causing an offensive touching." As Edward was walking down the street, a gust of wind blew his hat off. Edward reached out, trying to grab his hat, and narrowly missed striking Margaret in the face with his hand. Margaret, fearful of being struck by Edward, pushed Edward away. If charged with criminal assault, Edward should be found
914	Shore decided to destroy his dilapidated building in order to collect the insurance money. He hired Parsons to bum down the building. Parsons broke into the building and carefully searched it to make sure no one was inside. He failed, however, to see a vagrant asleep in an office closet. He started a fire. The building was destroyed, and the vagrant died from burns a week later. Two days after the fire, Shore filed an insurance claim in which he stated that he had no information about the cause of the fire. If Shore is guilty of felony-murder, it is because the vagrant's death occurred in connection with the felony of
915	A recently retired detective who had been instrumental in solving many important crimes in his community and had received many commendations from his police superiors was the subject of a docudrama aired on network television. The credits for the show indicated that it was based on the life of the detective but stated that not every event depicted in the show actually happened. The detective saw the show and was furious because, while most parts of the show dealt fairly accurately with some of the crimes he had helped solve, other parts portrayed his character as being involved in James Bondtype sexual escapades. If the detective sues the network for invasion of privacy, who likely will prevail?
916	On January 15, in a signed writing, Artisan agreed to remodel Ohner's building according to certain specifications, Ohner to pay the agreed price of $5,000 to Artisan's niece, Roberta Neese, as a birthday present. Neese did not learn of the agreement until her birthday on May 5. Before they signed the writing, Artisan and Ohner had orally agreed that their "written agreement will be null and void unless Ohner is able to obtain a $5,000 loan from the First National Bank before January 31." For this question only, assume that Ohner was unable to obtain the loan, and, on January 31, phoned Artisan and told him, "Don't begin the work. The deal is off." In an action for breach of contract brought against Ohner by the proper party, will Ohner be successful in asserting as a defense his inability to obtain a loan?
917	A federal statute taxing residential real property will most likely be upheld if it:
918	Palko is being treated by a physician for asbestosis, an abnormal chest condition that was caused by his on-the-job handling of materials containing asbestos. His physician has told him that the asbestosis is not presently cancerous, but that it considerably increases the risk that he will ultimately develop lung cancer. Palko brought an action for damages, based on strict product liability, against the supplier of the materials that contained asbestos. The court in this jurisdiction has ruled against recovery of damages for negligently inflicted emotional distress in the absence of physical harm. If the supplier is subject to liability to Palko for damages, should the award include damage for emotional distress he has suffered arising from his knowledge of the increased risk that he will develop lung cancer?
919	Rider, a bus passenger, sued Transit Company for injuries to his back from an accident caused by Transit's negligence. Transit denies that Rider received any injury in the accident. Rider's counsel seeks to introduce an affidavit he obtained in preparation for trial from Dr. Bond, who has since died. The affidavit avers that Dr. Bond examined Rider two days after the Transit Company accident and found him suffering from a recently incurred back injury. The judge should rule the affidavit
920	A farmer executed and delivered to a developer a quitclaim deed purporting to convey to the developer all of the right, title, and interest of the farmer in his land. The developer accepted the deed and placed it in his safe deposit box. Four years later, the farmer, who was indebted to his cousin in the amount of $35,000, executed and delivered to the cousin a warranty deed purporting to convey the land in exchange for a full release of the debt. The cousin immediately recorded her deed. The following month, the developer recorded his deed to the land and notified the cousin that he claimed title. There is no evidence of occupancy of the land, and the jurisdiction where the land is situated has a recording statute that requires good faith and value as elements of the junior claimant's priority. Which of the following best describes the conflicting claims of the developer and the cousin?
921	On March 1, Zeller orally agreed to sell his land, Homestead, to Byer for $46,000 to be paid on March 31. Byer orally agreed to pay $25,000 of the purchase price to Quincy in satisfaction of a debt which Zeller said he had promised to pay Quincy. On March 10, Byer dictated the agreement to his secretary but omitted all reference to the payment of the $25,000 to Quincy. In typing the agreement, the secretary mistakenly typed in $45,000 rather than $46,000 as the purchase price. Neither Byer nor Zeller carefully read the writing before signing it on March 15. Neither noticed the error in price and neither raised any question concerning omission of the payment to Quincy. In an action by Quincy against Byer for $25,000, which of the following, if proved, would best serve Byer as a defense?
922	The city of Metropolis has an ordinance that makes it an offense, punishable by fine, for the owner of a dog to permit the dog to run unleashed on a public way. Smythe, a police officer, observed a small dog running loose in the street. As he picked the dog up, Nelson, who was seated in her car lawfully parked at the curb, called out, "Oh, thank you, Officer, for returning Fido." Smythe asked Nelson whether the dog was hers, and when she acknowledged ownership, he asked her to see her driver's license. Nelson gave her name and address, but she refused to produce a driver's license. Smythe then told her to produce her driver's license if she did not want to go to jail. Nelson responded by saying, "Isn't this ridiculous?" Smythe took her by the arm and said, "Let's go. You are under arrest." Nelson cried out that Smythe was hurting her but he refused to release her arm, and she struck him with her free hand. Smythe then dragged Nelson from her car, forced her into his squad car, and took her to the police station. The incident took place on the street in front of the apartment where Nelson and her aged father, Joplin, lived. Smythe did not know that Joplin had observed what took place from a window in the apartment. If Nelson's father, Joplin, asserts a claim against Smythe for the intentional infliction of emotional distress, will Joplin prevail?
923	Before the conclusion of a beauty pageant, the judges announced the first runner-up and the winner. As the auditorium quieted for the winner's acceptance remarks, the runner-up loudly said that the winner only won because she slept with all of the judges. The winner immediately slapped the runner-up forcefully in the face. If the runner-up brings an action for battery against the winner, who will prevail?
924	Jackson and Brannick planned to break into a federal government office to steal food stamps. Jackson telephoned Crowley one night and asked whether Crowley wanted to buy some "hot" food stamps. Crowley, who understood that "hot" meant stolen, said: "Sure, bring them right over." Jackson and Brannick then successfully executed their scheme. That same night they delivered the food stamps to Crowley, who bought them for $500. Crowley did not ask when or by whom the stamps were stolen. All three were arrested. Jackson and Brannick entered guilty pleas in federal court to a charge of larceny in connection with the theft. Crowley was brought to trial in the state court on a charge of conspiracy to steal food stamps. If Jackson and Brannick are charged with conspiracy to steal the stamps in the state court, they should, on the evidence stated, be found
925	A company that was the leading supplier of home water filtration systems had a network of sales promoters who were under contract for two- or three-year terms and were compensated solely by commissions earned from sales and by occasional bonuses. Veteran promoters also earned commissions by recruiting other promoters for the company. One of the company's veteran promoters was contacted by a former top sales representative for another manufacturer who was looking for similar sales opportunities in the region. The sales rep knew that the promoter might be able to get her a position with his company, which was looking for additional promoters. At the time he met with the sales rep, the promoter's contract with the company had one more month to run. When the promoter's contract with the company expired, he announced that he was forming his own business to market a different line of water filtration systems manufactured by a competitor of the company, and that the sales rep would be in charge of his promotional network. The company brought an action against the promoter for interference with business relations for hiring the sales rep. At a preliminary hearing, the parties stipulated to the above facts and that the promoter was an independent contractor rather than an employee of the company. The promoter then filed a motion for a summary judgment in his favor. Should the court grant the promoter's motion?
926	A defendant's car was stopped by an officer for a minor traffic violation. The officer recognized the defendant as a suspect in a multimillion-dollar bank fraud scheme that had just been discovered by the authorities. She placed the defendant under arrest and gave him Miranda warnings. She then asked for permission to search the trunk of the car. The defendant nodded and unlocked the trunk. The officer searched the trunk and discovered a bag containing what appeared to be cocaine in a compartment in the trunk. When later tests determined that it was cocaine, the authorities added a charge of transporting illegal narcotics to the defendant's indictment. At a preliminary hearing, the defendant moved to have evidence of the cocaine excluded as the result of a search in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Should the court grant the defendant's motion?
927	With the owner's permission, a defendant took the owner's car with the intention of driving it three miles to a grocery store and back. While on his way to the store, the defendant decided to keep the car. Two days later, he changed his mind and returned the car. The defendant is charged with larceny of the car. The defendant should be found:
928	A wife wanted to have her husband murdered in order to collect the proceeds from a life insurance policy. The wife solicited the services of a hitman, agreeing to split the insurance proceeds with him. The plan was for the hitman to shoot the husband at home and make it look like a botched burglary attempt, while the wife would be at her church hall playing bingo that night. However, when the hitman broke into the apartment, the husband was able to subdue him and call the police. The hitman was arrested and implicated the wife, who was arrested in the parish priest's office just after she had confessed the plan to the priest. The wife is charged with attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder in a state that retains the common law definitions of these crimes. A psychiatric evaluation of the hitman after he was arrested revealed that he was legally insane, and he later committed suicide while awaiting trial. As to the conspiracy charge against the wife, which of the following would be her most promising defense?
929	A candlemaker who owned a bee farm sold the farm to a beekeeper. Because the candlemaker was still interested in making beeswax candles, the contract provided that the candlemaker reserved the right to purchase all of the beeswax produced by the beekeeper during the next five years at the current market price at time of delivery, and the beekeeper agreed to supply "in any event a minimum of 100 pounds of beeswax per month during that period." For one year, the beekeeper delivered to the candlemaker and the candlemaker paid for all of the beeswax produced by the beekeeper. As the first year of the contract ended, the beekeeper was stung by a bee and, due to an allergy, became so seriously and permanently ill and impaired as to be unable to attend to the bees. He gave the candlemaker prompt notice that he would be unable to continue, and from that time on he never made another delivery of beeswax to the candlemaker. Assuming that contractual obligations existed between the candlemaker and the beekeeper, the beekeeper's refusal to perform was:
930	A famous singer contracted with a fashion designer to design all of her clothing for public appearances for the next year. The singer's boyfriend was an aspiring astrologer. To promote her boyfriend's career, the singer included a clause in the contract that the designer would use the boyfriend as his exclusive astrologer during the term of their agreement. Six months into the agreement, the singer and her boyfriend broke up. She told the designer that he did not have to use the boyfriend's services any longer, so the designer began consulting another astrologer. The boyfriend then learned of the agreement between the singer and the designer. Can he enforce the agreement in his favor?
931	A landlord leased an apartment to a tenant for five years. The lease provided that the landlord will: (i) keep the apartment building at a comfortable temperature 24 hours per day, and (ii) have the carpets cleaned once a year. Two years later, the landlord began turning off the air conditioning at 10 p.m. The tenant's apartment became hot and stuffy, and she demanded that the landlord honor the covenant. The landlord refused. The following month, the pipes burst in the tenant's only bathroom, rendering it unusable. The resultant flooding soiled some of the carpeting, which had not been cleaned in the past 12 months. The tenant reported the problems to the landlord, who did not return the tenant's phone calls. If the tenant successfully terminates the lease, it will be because the landlord did not:
932	Late one night, a man was walking up a very narrow city street when he noticed that a large garbage truck parked near the top of the hill had begun to roll, driverless, down the street toward him. Seeing that he could not proceed forward and escape the truck, and if he turned and ran downhill, he would soon be overtaken and crushed, he pushed open a window in the apartment building he was passing and climbed inside. The truck narrowly missed him as it careened down the street. The elderly tenant in the apartment, who had a serious heart condition and lived in fear of intruders, thought that the man was a local gang member trying to burglarize his apartment and suffered a major heart attack. If he sues the man, he can most likely:
933	The state takes a "bifurcated trial" approach to insanity defense cases. The first part of the trial determines the defendant's guilt or innocence, and the second part determines whether the defendant was legally sane at the time the crime was committed. It also has modeled most of its criminal code after the Model Penal Code. The defendant was on trial for murder. The prosecution produced three witnesses who testified that they had seen the defendant shoot the victim. The defense put the defendant on the stand, and the defense attorney asked him if he shot the victim. The defendant answered that he did not shoot a man, and that he had shot a tiger instead. The prosecution immediately objected, and moved that the defendant's testimony be stricken. How should the court rule on that motion?
934	Several cars of a freight train transporting nuclear waste derailed as the train neared a street crossing. One of the cars struck a motorist's car as it was waiting at the crossing gate, seriously injuring the motorist. The area around the accident was immediately evacuated, but fortunately none of the freight cars ruptured in the derailment. In an action alleging strict liability against the railway that operated the freight train, the motorist established the above facts and presented evidence of her injuries. The railway presented evidence that the derailment was caused by a hidden defect in the spikes that anchored the rails to the track. The spikes were manufactured by its regular supplier and had not previously caused any problems. The railroad also presented evidence that the local authorities were supposed to restrict access to roads crossing the freight line while that particular train was in transit, but they had failed to do so. In this action, the motorist is likely to:
935	The victim owned a cottage in an ocean resort area. He stayed there only during the summer months, and left the cottage unoccupied during the balance of the year. The defendant, a resident of a neighboring cottage, was aware of this practice. For a change in his routine, however, the victim decided to spend a week at the cabin in the off-season. Unaware that the victim was occupying the cottage, the defendant decided to borrow a portable television set that he knew the victim kept in the cottage. To avoid being seen, he entered the cottage late at night, using a key under the front doormat. He found the television set, disconnected it, and headed for the rear of the house to leave. He opened the kitchen door and found the victim seated there in the dark, having a late night snack. Both men were startled and neither man recognized the other in the dark. The defendant assumed that the victim was a burglar, and was afraid that he might be armed. Trying to flee the kitchen as quickly as possible, the defendant dropped the television set in the middle of the kitchen floor. As the set hit the floor, the picture tube exploded with a loud noise. The noise so frightened the victim that he had an immediate heart attack and died. If the defendant is charged with felony murder as the result of the victim's death, his best defense would be that:
936	In a state where gaming is legal, a professional gambler ran up a tab of $50,000 at his favorite casino. Pursuant to a longstanding agreement between the gambler and the casino, once the gambler's tab reached $50,000 he was required to repay the debt in five monthly installments of $10,000 before putting any additional charges on his tab. After making three repayments, the gambler approached the casino owner and offered an immediate payoff of $15,000 in cash as payment in full. The casino owner had a cash flow problem and needed the money, so he agreed. The gambler made the cash payment of $15,000 that same day. A few days later, the casino owner demanded $5,000 from the gambler. Does the casino owner have a right to collect $5,000 from the gambler?
937	A student and her boyfriend were going away to college and had quite a few personal belongings to transport. The student drove in her car while her father and her boyfriend rode in the father's van. About halfway to the college, while the van and the car were driving down the freeway, the van suddenly swerved out of control and ran off the highway, ending up on its side in the center divider. When the student ran to the van, she discovered to her horror that her father was dead, and her boyfriend appeared to be injured, but not severely. Because her father previously had heart trouble, the student assumed that he had had a heart attack while driving. Filled with remorse, the student told her boyfriend, "I'm so sorry about this. I'll make good any losses you suffer because of this accident." The boyfriend learned that he had suffered an injury to his spinal column that would prevent him from ever playing basketball again. He had been a scholarship athlete in basketball at the college and was considered to be a certain high draft selection for a professional basketball league when he graduated. The boyfriend brought an action against the student for several million dollars in damages. A subsequent investigation revealed that the accident was caused solely by a defect in the steering mechanism of the van. Which of the following is the best defense the student could assert against her boyfriend's claim?
938	Water District is an independent municipal water-supply district incorporated under the applicable laws of the state of Green. The district was created solely to supply water to an entirely new community in a recently developed area of Green. That new community is racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse, and the community has never engaged in any discrimination against members of minority groups. The five-member, elected governing board of the newly created Water District contains two persons who are members of racial minority groups. At its first meeting, the governing board of Water District adopted a rule unqualifiedly setting aside 25% of all positions on the staff of the District and 25% of all contracts to be awarded by the District to members of racial minority groups. The purpose of the rule was "to help redress the historical discrimination against these groups in this country and to help them achieve economic parity with other groups in our society." Assume that no federal statute applies. A suit by appropriate parties challenges the constitutionality of these set-asides. In this suit, the most appropriate ruling on the basis of applicable United States Supreme Court precedent would be that the set-asides are
939	A cattle-producing state adopted a statute requiring any food service business operating in the state to serve beef raised in the United States. A licensed hot dog vendor who worked at a football field within the state and who had been buying hot dogs made with foreign beef for the past several years estimated that switching to an all-beef hot dog made from United States beef would reduce his profits by 10%. An attorney hired by the vendor to challenge the statute discovered during research into the case that most of the footballs used at the football field at which the vendor worked were made of foreign leather. Which of the following grounds is the vendor's best argument against the constitutionality of the state statute?
940	The police department of a small city has jurisdiction within the city limits and over a defined portion of the surrounding rural communities within the county. A farmer lives in one of the rural communities receiving police protection from the city. The farmer does not pay any tax to the city directly, but a portion of the farmer's county property tax is turned over by the county to the city in order to support the city's police department. The farmer's property was vandalized several times over the past several months, and the farmer became unhappy with the police protection that the city was providing. After his complaints to the police department and city hall did not improve the situation, the farmer wanted to vote against the mayor in the next election, but a city ordinance provides that only residents of the city may vote in city elections. If the farmer brings a suit to compel the city to allow him to vote in the city's mayoral election, is he likely to prevail?
941	After learning that she was the sole beneficiary in her wealthy uncle's will, a niece broke into his house while he was away one evening. She brought with her a vial of poison that she believed would be lethal but undetectable. She poured it into a glass of water that her uncle had placed on the bedside table. During the night, the uncle took a drink of water and the poison started to affect his ability to breathe. Thinking he was having a heart attack, the uncle started to go downstairs to call his doctor. On the way, he slipped and fell down the stairs, breaking his neck. He was found dead the next day. An autopsy revealed that the uncle had ingested poison, but not in a sufficient quantity to have caused death. Further investigation led the police to the niece, who was arrested and charged with burglary and murder. Based on the above facts, the niece should be convicted of:
942	An investor owned an office building and an apartment building, which were connected to each other. There was no access to the second floor of the apartment building other than a common stairway located entirely within the office building. The investor conveyed the apartment building to a landlord. The landlord, her tenants, and their guests continued to use the common stairway. Subsequently, the investor conveyed the office building to an accounting firm. There was no mention of the stairway in the accounting firm's deed. Both the landlord's deed and the accounting firm's deed were properly recorded. A few years later, the stairway had become dilapidated. The landlord was concerned about the stairway's condition of disrepair, which she felt reduced the value of the apartment building and posed a risk of injury to her tenants and their guests using the stairs. The landlord approached the accounting firm about repairing the stairs, and even offered to pay for half the cost. The firm refused. After getting an estimate from a reputable construction company, the landlord told the accounting firm she was willing to pay the entire cost of fixing the stairs. The firm again refused. If the landlord files suit against the accounting firm, can she compel it to allow her to repair the stairs?
943	In an accountant's trial for filing fraudulent tax reports, the prosecution calls a former colleague of the accountant, and she testifies that the accountant's reputation in the community is for frequently participating in very questionable reporting, often resulting in unnecessary risk for his clients. She testifies further that she thinks the accountant is dishonest. Should the trial court admit this evidence over the accountant's objection?
944	A felon intending to rob a market waited outside until there were no customers. When he saw that the market was empty, he went inside and walked up to the counter with his hand in his jacket pocket to simulate a gun. Before the clerk could turn around to see what the felon wanted, another customer entered the market, startling the felon, who turned and ran out the door. On a charge of attempted robbery, the felon should be found:
945	Ben was the illegitimate, unacknowledged child of Fred. Fred died intestate, leaving neither spouse nor any children other than Ben. The state's law of intestate succession provides that an unacknowledged illegitimate child may not inherit his father's property. The spouse, all other blood relations, and the state are preferred as heirs over the unacknowledged illegitimate child. Ben filed suit in an appropriate court alleging that the state statute barring an illegitimate child from sharing in a parent s estate is invalid, and that he should be declared lawful heir to his father's estate. In challenging the validity of the state statute, Ben's strongest argument would be that
946	A woman arranged with a bank to take out a loan for $30,000, secured with a mortgage on her home. On June 3, the woman executed the note and the mortgage, and the bank gave her a certified check for $30,000. On June 4, the woman sold her home to a wealthy buyer for $150,000 in cash. The buyer knew nothing about the mortgage. On June 5, the buyer recorded her deed to the property. Two hours after the buyer recorded, the woman fled the country. On the evening of June 8, which was a Saturday, the buyer presented her niece with a deed to the property as a gift. At 10 a.m. on June 10, the bank recorded its mortgage. At 2 p.m. on June 10, the niece recorded her deed. After the woman missed her first mortgage payment on July 1, the bank employees went to the title office. They discovered the deeds to the buyer and her niece. The bank demanded that the niece satisfy the $30,000 mortgage. The niece filed an appropriate suit to determine the various interests in the property. The recording statute in the jurisdiction reads, in relevant part: "A conveyance of an estate in land shall not be valid against any subsequent purchaser for value, without notice thereof, unless the conveyance is recorded." The court should rule that:
947	A landowner properly conveyed a lot "to my brother, and on my brother's death, to my daughter." The brother took up possession of the lot and lived there for two years. He then conveyed "my interest in the lot" to his girlfriend. The girlfriend took up residence on the lot. Since she has been living there, she has been sent two county property tax bills, which she has refused to pay. The county is now threatening to bring an action to force a judicial sale of the lot to cover the tax deficiency. The daughter files an appropriate suit asking the court to evict the girlfriend from the lot and to compel her to pay the taxes for her period of occupancy. The court will rule that:
948	A plaintiff sued a defendant for personal injuries that the plaintiff suffered as a result of a battery committed on the plaintiff by the defendant. The defendant admits that the plaintiff was beaten up, but claims he had nothing to do with the plaintiff's injuries. At trial, the defendant testified in his own behalf that on the date that the plaintiff suffered his injuries, he (the defendant) was on an extended vacation in England, 2,000 miles away from the place where the battery occurred. The plaintiff's attorney did not cross-examine the defendant regarding that testimony. In rebuttal, the plaintiff's attorney calls a witness, who is willing to testify that one week after the plaintiff suffered his injuries, the defendant said to the witness, "I haven't been out of the country in five years." The witness's testimony is:
949	A car manufacturer entered into contracts with various refineries to purchase the gasoline they produced for the manufacturer's dealerships. One agreement with an oil dealer provided that the car manufacturer was given the right to purchase all gasoline refined by the oil dealer for the next five years at a price set at 95% of the domestic market price at the time of delivery. The car manufacturer agreed to purchase no less than 5,000 gallons a week and to use its own tankers to transport the gasoline from the oil dealer's refinery to its storage facilities. At the time the contract was signed, the car manufacturer gave written notice to the oil dealer that it intended to buy all gasoline produced by the oil dealer until further notice. This agreement between the car manufacturer and the oil dealer was:
950	Motorco is a manufacturer of motor vehicles. A federal regulation requires that all motor vehicles manufactured for sale in the United States be equipped with seat belts for each passenger and prescribes specifications for such belts. Motorco equipped all its cars with seat belts. It purchased all the bolts used in its seat belt assemblies from Boltco and it tested samples from each shipment received. Dunn purchased a motor vehicle manufactured by Motorco. While operating the car, with Price as a passenger in the front seat, Dunn collided with another vehicle. The collision was due solely to Dunn's negligence. Price had his seat belt fastened, but one of the bolts which anchored the belt to the frame broke. Price was thrown through the windshield, sustaining various injuries. Dunn, whose belt was fastened and held, was killed when, following the collision, the car went off the road, down an embankment, and overturned. Subsequent to the accident, tests of the bolt that broke showed metallurgical defects. Motorco's records showed that tests of samples from the shipment in which the defective bolt was received revealed no defective bolts. In a negligence action by Price against Motorco, a defense that is likely to prevail is that
951	The plaintiff was riding down a department store escalator when the escalator malfunctioned, causing the plaintiff to fall forward to the floor and injure himself. His companion, who has no medical training, tried to make the plaintiff comfortable. While waiting for the ambulance, the plaintiff said, "My left arm is numb and I have chest pains. I'm afraid I'm having a heart attack." Upon being taken to the hospital, it was determined that the plaintiff had not suffered a heart attack, but had sustained severe damage to his chest and to the nerves affecting feeling in his left arm. The plaintiff sued the department store for his injuries. At trial, the plaintiff called his companion to testify to the statement made by the plaintiff. The companion's testimony as to the statement is:
952	Susan owned Goldacre, a tract of land, in fee simple. By warranty deed, she conveyed Goldacre in fee simple to Ted for a recited consideration of "$10 and other valuable consideration." The deed was promptly and properly recorded. One week later, Susan and Ted executed a written document that stated that the conveyance of Goldacre was for the purpose of establishing a trust for the benefit of Benton, a child of Susan's. Ted expressly accepted the trust and signed the document with Susan. This written agreement was not authenticated to be eligible for recordation and there never was an attempt to record it. Ted entered into possession of Goldacre and distributed the net income from Goldacre to Benton at appropriate intervals. Five years later, Ted conveyed Goldacre in fee simple to Patricia by warranty deed. Patricia paid the fair market value of Goldacre, had no knowledge of the written agreement between Susan and Ted, and entered into possession of Goldacre. Benton made demand upon Patricia for distribution of income at the next usual time Ted would have distributed. Patricia refused. Benton brought an appropriate action against Patricia for a decree requiring her to perform the trust Ted had theretofore recognized. In such action, judgment should be for
953	Alford was a suspect in a homicide committed during a robbery of a liquor store. Barber was a friend of Alford. Police telephoned Barber and asked if he would help locate Alford. Barber agreed and met the police officers at headquarters later that night. After a discussion during which police asked questions about Alford and the homicide, Barber said that he wanted to get something "off his chest" and advised the officers that he was in on the robbery but that Alford had shot the owner of the store without his permission or prior knowledge. The officers then for the first time gave Barber his Miranda warnings. Barber was indicted for felony murder. He moved to prevent the introduction of his statement into evidence. His motion should be
954	On April 1, Owner and Buyer signed a writing in which Owner, "in consideration of $100 to be paid to Owner by Buyer," offered Buyer the right to purchase Greenacre for $100,000 within 30 days. The writing further provided, "This offer will become effective as an option only if and when the $100 consideration is in fact paid." On April 20, Owner, having received no payment or other communication from Buyer, sold and conveyed Greenacre to Citizen for $120,000. On April 21, Owner received a letter from Buyer enclosing a cashier's check for $100 payable to Owner and stating, "I am hereby exercising my option to purchase Greenacre and am prepared to close whenever you're ready." Which of the following, if proved, best supports Buyer's suit against Owner for breach of contract?
955	A town in a rural state facing financial difficulties passed a variety of "sin taxes," including one aimed at electronic game arcades frequented by local juveniles. The tax is a one cent per game tax imposed on the manufacturers of the games based on the estimated number of plays over a machine's lifetime. There are no electronic game manufacturers in the state. Which of the following constitutional provisions would support the best argument against enforcement of the tax?
956	Pike sued Digger, the contractor who constructed Pike's house, for breach of warranty of habitability. At trial, in cross-examination of Pike, Digger's attorney asked whether Pike had sued another contractor thirty years before, claiming similar defects in another house built for Pike. The question was not objected to and Pike answered that she had had some "water problems" with the first house she ever purchased, but no suit was filed. Digger then called Wirth, the contractor of thirty years before, to testify that Pike had brought suit against Wirth for defects in the earlier house, many of which were like those now claimed to be found in the home Digger built but that the case was settled without trial. The trial court should rule Wirth's offered testimony
957	A 13-year-old boy who lived on a farm with his parents in a rural area had learned to drive the family's tractor when he was 11. A state statute permitted persons without a driver's license to operate farm vehicles on public roads for short distances. One morning the boy took the tractor onto a public road to reach one of the outlying fields a few hundred yards away. As he neared the field he was distracted by a girl riding by on a bicycle, and cut in front of a milk delivery truck that was starting to pass him. The truck swerved off the road, injuring the driver. If the driver sues the boy to recover damages for his injuries, which of the following statements is most correct regarding the standard of care to be applied?
958	Pullen used aluminum brackets in her business. On the telephone listed as hers in the telephone book, Pullen received a call in which the caller said, "This is John Denison of Denison Hardware Company. We have a special on aluminum brackets this week at 30 percent off." Pullen ordered brackets from the caller. When the brackets were never delivered, Pullen sued Denison for breach of contract.' At trial, Denison, who denies having made the telephone call, objects to Pullen's testimony concerning it. When asked, Pullen testifies that, aside from the telephone call, she had never heard Denison speak until she met him in the judge's chambers before the trial and that, in her opinion, the voice on the telephone was Denison's. The strongest argument for admission of Pullen's testimony concerning the telephone call is that
959	The open-air amphitheater in the city park of Rightville has been utilized for concerts and other entertainment programs. Until this year, each of the groups performing in that city facility was allowed to make its own arrangements for sound equipment and sound technicians. After recurring complaints from occupants of residential buildings adjacent to the city park about intrusive noise from some performances held in the amphitheater, the Rightville City Council passed an ordinance establishing city control over all sound amplification at all programs held there. The ordinance provided that Rightville's Department of Parks would be the sole provider in the amphitheater of sound amplification equipment and of the technicians to operate the equipment "to ensure a proper balance between the quality of the sound at such performances and respect for the privacy of nearby residential neighbors." Which of the following standards should a court use to determine the constitutionality on its face of this content neutral ordinance?
960	As a woman was walking home on a dark cloudy night, a man came upon her from behind and stole her purse. A suspect was arrested nearby shortly thereafter. After the suspect had been booked, the police took his photograph. They then showed his photograph, along with the photographs of four people who had the same general features as the arrested man, to the woman. The woman identified the suspect as the culprit. At trial, after the woman had identified the suspect as the person who stole her purse, the suspect's attorney objects to the prosecution's introduction into evidence of the photographic identification. The objection will most likely be:
961	Metterly, the owner in fee simple of Brownacre by quitclaim deed conveyed Brownacre to her daughter, Doris, who paid no consideration for the conveyance. The deed was never recorded. About a year after the delivery of the deed, Metterly decided that this gift had been ill-advised, She requested that Doris destroy the deed, which Doris dutifully and voluntarily did. Within the month following the destruction of the deed, Metterly and Doris were killed in a common disaster. Each of the successors in interest claimed title to Brownacre. In an appropriate action to determine the title to Brownacre, the probable outcome will be that
962	An artist received permission to display some of his paintings in the lobby of his town's library. The librarian really liked one of the paintings and offered the artist $200 for it. The artist accepted the offer and payment in advance from the librarian, and told her that he would deliver the painting to her at the end of the month when his display came down. A few days later, however, an eccentric millionaire in the town who was unaware of the agreement between the librarian and the artist offered to buy the painting for $200,000. The artist quickly agreed and promptly gave the millionaire the painting. When the librarian found out, the artist offered to paint her another similar painting or return her money, but the librarian was not satisfied. If the librarian sues for specific performance to gain possession of the painting, will she be successful?
963	Theresa owned Blueacre, a tract of land, in fee simple. Theresa wrote and executed, with the required formalities, a will that devised Blueacre to "my daughter, Della, for life with remainder to my descendants per stirpes." At the time of writing the will, Theresa had a husband and no descendants living other than her two children, Della and Seth. Theresa died and the will was duly admitted to probate. Theresa's husband predeceased her. Theresa was survived by Della, Seth, four grandchildren, and one great-grandchild. Della and Seth were Theresa's sole heirs at law. Della and Seth brought an appropriate action for declaratory judgment as to title of Blueacre. Guardians ad litem were appointed and all other steps were taken so that the judgment would bind all persons interested whether born or unborn. In that action, if the court rules that Della has a life estate in the whole of Blueacre and that the remainder is contingent, it will be because the court chose one of several possible constructions and that the chosen construction
964	While executing a search warrant at the home of a suspected arsonist, the police heard a knock on the door. A plain clothes officer answered the door and found a young woman standing outside with a backpack in her hand. The woman asked for the owner of the home by name and was told that the owner was not available at the moment. The woman replied, "Give him this, and tell him thanks for the $8,000," and she gave the officer the backpack. The officer opened the backpack and found eight hi-tech delay timers. The officer then identified himself as a police officer and placed the woman under arrest. He performed a quick patdown of the woman's outer clothing. In her jacket pocket, the officer found a package that appeared to be (and later proved to be) heroin. In addition to arson-related charges, the woman was charged with possession of heroin. At trial, the woman's attorney moved to have the heroin excluded from evidence. How should the court rule?
965	Davis has a small trampoline in his backyard which, as he knows, is commonly used by neighbor children as well as his own. The trampoline is in good condition, is not defective in any way, and normally is surrounded by mats to prevent injury if a user should fall off. Prior to leaving with his family for the day, Davis leaned the trampoline up against the side of the house and placed the mats in the garage. While the Davis family was away, Philip, aged 11, a new boy in the neighborhood, wandered into Davis's yard and saw the trampoline. Philip had not previously been aware of its presence, but, having frequently used a trampoline before, he decided to set it up, and started to jump. He lost his balance on one jump and took a hard fall on the bare ground, suffering a serious injury that would have been prevented by the mats. An action has been brought against Davis on Philip's behalf to recover damages for the injuries Philip sustained from his fall. In this jurisdiction, the traditional common-law rules pertaining to contributory negligence have been replaced by a pure comparative negligence rule. In his action against Davis, will Philip prevail?
966	A seller entered into a written contract with a vintner on April 4, whereby the seller agreed to convey a vineyard to the vintner for $2 million. The terms of the contract set the closing date as June 1. At the time the seller entered into the agreement with the vintner, the seller had no interest in the vineyard. On April 15, the seller entered into a written agreement with a landowner, whom the seller believed to be the owner of the vineyard. According to the terms of the agreement, the landowner was to convey the vineyard to the seller on or before May 25. Another term of the agreement stated "time is of the essence." On May 24, the landowner conveyed his interest in the vineyard to the seller. When the seller went to record the deed, she discovered from records in the recorder's office that the landowner held clear title to only seven-eighths of the vineyard. It took some time for thc seller to remove the cloud from the title and procure ownership in full of the vineyard. She finally did so on August 1, and on that day she tendered a warranty deed to the vineyard to the vintner. The vintner refused to tender $2 million or any other sum to the seller, asserting that the seller had broken her agreement by failing to close on June L The seller then sued the vintner for specific performance. If the vintner prevails it will be because:
967	During 1976 a series of arsons, one of which damaged the Humongous Store, occurred in the City of Swelter. In early 1977 Swelter's City Council adopted this resolution: The City will pay $10,000 for the arrest and conviction of anyone guilty of any of the 1976 arsons committed here. The foregoing was telecast by the city's sole television station once daily for one week. Subsequently, Humongous, by a written memorandum to Gimlet, a private detective, proposed to pay Gimlet $200 "for each day 's work you actually perform in investigating our fire." Thereafter, in August, 1977, the City Council by resolution repealed its reward offer and caused this resolution to be broadcast once daily for a week over two local radio stations, the local television station having meanwhile ceased operations. In September, 1977, a Humongous employee voluntarily confessed to Gimlet to having committed all of the 1976 arsons. Humongous' president thereupon paid Gimlet at the proposed daily rate for his investigation and suggested that Gimlet also claim the city's reward, of which Gimlet had been previously unaware. Gimlet immediately made the claim. In December, 1977, as a result of Gimlet's investigation, the Humongous employee was convicted of burning the store. The city, which has no immunity to suit, has since refused to pay Gimlet anything, although he swears that he never heard of the city's repealer before claiming its reward. With respect to duration, the city's reward offer was terminable
968	A general contractor entered into a written agreement with a subcontractor, whereby the subcontractor agreed to furnish heavy equipment and operators for a new state toll road project that the contractor was overseeing. Among the duties that the subcontractor undertook to perform was the installation of the toll collection booths and automatic toll collection machinery. The contract contains four clauses of special interest. The first is a time-is-of-the-essence clause, which states that the subcontractor must have all toll booths and toll collection equipment in place and operable by August 20. The second is a clause concerning modifications--any modification of the contract without written approval by the general contractor would be void. The third is an exoneration clause, which holds the subcontractor harmless for any property damage occurring while the subcontractor is placing the toll booths and automatic toll collection machinery. The fourth is a liquidated damages clause, providing for liquidated damages of $1,000 per day chargeable against the subcontractor for each day that the subcontractor fails to complete the job beyond the contract date. Before the subcontractor began work on the general contractor's project, the subcontractor was offered an extremely lucrative opportunity to work on a construction project in a war-ravaged Middle Eastern oil sheikdom. The rebuilding work would continue for several years and promised to bring the subcontractor far more income than the work for the general contractor. The subcontractor wished to assign his part of the contract with the general contractor to his former employee, who was equally experienced and qualified in heavy equipment contracting. Which clause in the contract between the general contractor and the subcontractor would be most likely to bar the subcontractor from assigning to his former employee?
969	A driver borrowed a car from a friend. When the driver picked up the car, the friend forgot to warn the driver that the brake fluid had a tendency to leak out of the brake system and needed to be replaced regularly. The friend telephoned the driver's wife and warned her about the brake fluid problem. The wife, however, forgot to tell the driver. Shortly thereafter, the driver was driving the wife to work in the borrowed car. The driver was proceeding along at a reasonable rate of speed and within the posted speed limit. As he approached an intersection, he saw another car run through the red light and into the intersection. The driver, on seeing the other car, stepped on the brakes, but the brakes failed and the two cars collided. If the proper amount of brake fluid had been in the brake system, the driver could have stopped in time to avoid the collision. The driver and the wife were injured. The jurisdiction has adopted "pure" comparative negligence. If the driver asserts a claim against the operator of the vehicle that ran the red light, the driver will:
970	A robber attempted an armed robbery of a liquor store with an accomplice. A police officer arrived at the scene and shot and killed the robber's accomplice, who had been guarding the door with a gun and had not obeyed the officer's command to drop the weapon. Meanwhile, the store owner pulled out a gun and shot at the robber but missed. The robber then killed the store owner in self-defense before he could fire a second shot. In most jurisdictions, the robber is guilty of felony murder for the death of:
971	A jurisdiction has the following decisional law on questions of principal and accomplice liability: CASE A: Defendant, a hardware store owner, sold several customers an item known as a "SuperTrucker," which detects police radar and enables speeders to avoid detection. When one of the devices broke down and the speeder was arrested, he confessed that he often sped, secure in the knowledge that his "SuperTrucker" would warn him of police radar in the vicinity. Held: Defendant guilty as an accomplice to speeding. CASE B: Defendant told Arnold that Defendant had stored some stereo equipment in a self-storage locker. He gave Arnold a key and asked Arnold to pick up the equipment and deliver it to Defendant's house. Arnold complied, and removed the equipment from the locker, using the key. In fact, the equipment belonged to Defendant's neighbor, whose locker key Defendant had found in the driveway. Held: Defendant guilty as an accomplice to burglary. CASE C: Tooley, a city council member, accepted a bribe from Defendant in exchange for his vote on Defendant's application for a zoning variance. A statute prohibits the taking of bribes by public officials. Held: Defendant not guilty as an accomplice to Tooley's violation of the bribery statute. CASE D: Defendant, an innkeeper, sometimes let his rooms to prostitutes, whom he knew to be using the rooms to ply their trade. He charged the prostitutes the same price as other guests at his inn. Held: Defendant not guilty as an accomplice to prostitution. In this jurisdiction, conviction for statutory rape requires proof of the defendant's knowledge that the victim is underage. Howard, who knew that Sarah was underage, encouraged George, who was unaware of Sarah's age, to have sex with Sarah. Howard has been charged as an accomplice to statutory rape. He should be
972	To provide low-cost housing to the unemployed, a city has a policy of leasing empty city-owned buildings to social agencies that promise to convert or rehabilitate the buildings into habitable, low-cost apartments and to pay the city 10% of any net profit made from rentals. A church entered into such an agreement with the city and converted one of the city's abandoned office buildings into 50 small, low-cost apartments. The lease agreement used by the church provides, among other things, that the lessee must affirm a belief in God. The lease agreement was submitted to the city for approval prior to its use by the church, and it was approved. On the first day that the church made the apartments available for rent, the plaintiff, an avowed atheist, applied to lease a unit. The plaintiff's application was quickly denied for the sole reason that the plaintiff refused to affirm a belief in God. If the plaintiff brings suit against the church on the ground that the required affirmation of a belief in God violates the plaintiff's constitutional rights, who likely will prevail?
973	Dutton, disappointed by his 8-year-old son's failure to do well in school, began systematically depriving the child of food during summer vacation. Although his son became seriously ill from malnutrition, Dutton failed to call a doctor. He believed that as a parent he had the sole right to determine whether the child was fed or received medical treatment. Eventually the child died. An autopsy disclosed that the child had suffered agonizingly as a result of the starvation, that a physician's aid would have alleviated the suffering, and that although the child would have died in a few months from malnutrition, the actual cause of death was an untreatable form of cancer. The father was prosecuted for murder, defined in the jurisdiction as "unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought." The father should be
974	A repair technician employed by a photocopier company was called to a bank to fix a copy machine. It was Friday afternoon, and the technician planned to be on vacation the next week, so he decided to try to complete the repairs on the spot even if it required working past the normal end of the work day at 5 p.m., when he was supposed to leave. He believed that he would be able to exit the building when he was finished. Thus, he continued to work after the bank closed without alerting anyone as to his presence. At 5:30 p.m., the bank's security guard activated its electronic security system, which automatically locked the locks in every door in the building. The guard then went home for the weekend. When the technician completed his work at 5:45 p.m., he attempted to leave the photocopy room, but discovered that the door was locked. There was no phone in the room and his cell phone was dead, and he realized that no one would be back at the bank until Monday. Noticing a smoke detector on the ceiling, he dumped a file of papers into a waste basket and set them ablaze. Eventually, the detector picked up the burning particles from the fire and set off a fire alarm. The fire department arrived soon after and freed the technician. The papers were copies of documents for which the bank had the originals. What cause or causes of action may the bank assert against the technician?
975	A city passed an ordinance prohibiting all of its police officers and firefighters from "moonlighting" (working a second job). The ordinance was passed to ensure that all police officers and firefighters were readily available in case an emergency should arise and for overtime work when the situation warranted it. Other city employees, including members of the city council and the city manager, had no such restrictions placed on secondary employment. A police officer who wanted to moonlight as a dancer at a nightclub within city limits brought suit in federal court, alleging that the ordinance violated her constitutional rights. How should the court rule on the constitutionality of the ordinance?
976	Gyro, an expert in lifting and emplacing equipment atop tall buildings, contracted in a signed writing to lift and emplace certain air-conditioning equipment atop Tower's building. An exculpatory clause in the contract provided that Gyro would not be liable for any physical damage to Tower's building occurring during installation of the air-conditioning equipment. There was also a clause providing for per diem damages if Gyro did not complete performance by a specified date and a clause providing that "time is of the essence." Another clause provided that any subsequent agreement for extra work under the contract must be in writing and signed by both parties. With ample time remaining under the contract for commencement and completion of his performance, Gyro notified Tower that he was selling his business to Copter, who was equally expert in lifting and emplacing equipment atop tall buildings, and that Copter had agreed to "take over the Gyro-Tower contract." If Tower refuses to accept Copter's services, which of the following clauses in the GyroTower contract will best support Tower's contention that Gyro's duties under the contract were not delegable without Tower's consent?
977	The defendant and his friend entered a convenience store wearing ski masks and demanded all the money in the register, claiming they had a gun. The clerk promptly complied with that demand. The pair grabbed the money and ran out the door. A police officer saw them running through the parking lot, still wearing their masks, and surmised that a robbery had taken place. Without any warning, the police officer drew out his gun and fired two shots, one of which shattered the defendant's kneecap and sent him tumbling to the ground. The other bullet struck the friend in the head, killing him instantly. The defendant is placed on trial for the friend's death on a felony murder theory. Which of the following is the best argument for the defendant to make in order to gain an acquittal:
978	A local physician who was prominent in the community and beloved by his patients died suddenly of a heart attack. A reporter with the local newspaper was assigned to write an obituary before the next day's edition went to press. The reporter talked briefly with the physician's widow, and then called the state medical school, from which the physician had always said he had graduated. As it was late in the afternoon, the reporter did not speak with any professors but with a secretary in the office of the dean. When asked about the physician, the secretary replied that she did not think the physician ever graduated. The local newspaper printed this information in the next day's edition. On reading the obituary, the physician's widow became very angry, as the physician had, in fact, graduated with high honors. She demanded a retraction from the newspaper. The next day, on the front page, the newspaper admitted its error and stated that the physician graduated with high honors from the state's medical school. They also fired the reporter. Nonetheless, both the executor of the physician's estate and his widow sued the local newspaper for defamation. What is the local newspaper's best defense?
979	Drew was tried for the July 21 murder of Victor. Drew called Wilson to testify to alibi. On cross-examination of Wilson, the prosecutor asked, "Isn't it a fact that you are Drew's first cousin?" The question is
980	The warden of State Prison prohibits the photographing of the face of any prisoner without the prisoner's consent. Photographer, a news photographer, wanted to photograph Mobster, a notorious organized crime figure incarcerated at State Prison. To circumvent the warden's prohibition, Photographer flew over the prison exercise yard and photographed Mobster. Prisoner, who was imprisoned for a technical violation of a regulatory statute, happened to be standing next to Mobster when the photograph was taken. When the picture appeared in the press, Prisoner suffered severe emotional distress because he believed that his business associates and friends would think he was consorting with gangsters. Prisoner suffered no physical harm as the result of his emotional distress. Prisoner brought an action against Photographer for intentional or reckless infliction of emotional distress. What is the best argument that Photographer can make in support of a motion for summary judgment?
981	Congress declared war on a nation in Asia. Congress also passed a statute making it a crime to make public statements in support of the Asian nation and against the United States. A United States citizen subsequently spoke out against the war at a rally in front of a federal building. During her speech, the citizen urged people to "smash the windows of the federal building like U.S. troops are doing" in the Asian nation. Several members of the frenzied crowd did as the speaker urged. The speaker was immediately arrested and charged with violating the statute. Can the speaker successfully defend by asserting that the statute violates her First Amendment speech rights?
982	Phillips purchased a suit of thermal underwear manufactured by Makorp from synthetic materials. While he was attempting to stamp out a fire, Phillips' thermal underwear caught fire and burned in a melting fashion up to his waist. He suffered a heart attack a half hour later. In a suit against Makorp, Phillips alleged that negligence and breach of warranty caused both the burn and the heart attack. Phillips testified to the fpregoing. Dr. Black, a physician, is called by Phillips to testify that, on the basis of her examination of Phillips and blood study reports by an independent laboratory, reports which were not introduced in evidence, she believes that Phillips has a permanent disability. This testimony is
983	Jim watched a liquor store furtively for some time, planning to hold it up. He bought a realistic-looking toy gun for the job. One night, just before the store's closing time, he drove to the store, opened the front door and entered. He reached in his pocket for the toy gun, but then became frightened and began to move back toward the front door. However, the shopkeeper had seen the butt of the gun. Fearing a hold up, the shopkeeper produced a gun from under the counter, pointed it at Jim, and yelled, "Stop!" Jim ran to the door and the toy gun fell from his pocket. The shopkeeper fired. The shot missed Jim, but struck and killed a passerby outside the store. A statute in the jurisdiction defines burglary as "breaking and entering any building or structure with the intent to commit a felony or to steal therein." On a charge of burglary, Jim's best defense would be that
984	A contract between a camera store and a distributor of camera lenses called for the sale of 20 standard zoom lenses that would be compatible with a particular manufacturer's film and digital cameras, for a price of $300 per lens. After an employee of the camera store with authority to accept deliveries accepted shipment of the zoom lenses, store personnel learned that the lenses would not work with the manufacturer's film camera, but instead were compatible only with the manufacturer's digital camera. The camera store filed suit. At trial, the store's attorneys established that the nonconforming lenses were worth $200 per lens. Which of the following should be the measure of damages applied to determine the camera store's loss?
985	State Green passed a statute requiring all commercial trucks passing through the state to use Type A tires, even though all other states permit the use of either Type A or Type B tires on commercial vehicles. The United States Supreme Court struck down the state Green statute and stated in its opinion that Type A and Type B tires are equally safe. Subsequent to the Supreme Court decision, the legislature of state Yellow enacted a statute requiring the use of Type B tires by commercial vehicles and banning the use of Type A tires by commercial vehicles. The statute states that the reason for the prohibition is that Type A tires are dangerous. The best argument for striking down the state Yellow statute as unconstitutional would be based on:
986	An uncle executed a warranty deed granting a parcel of land to his nephew. The uncle placed the deed in his bedroom closet and told his friend to get the deed and give it to the nephew if the nephew survived the uncle. Several years later, the uncle conveyed the land by quitclaim deed to a purchaser for $20,000. The uncle told the purchaser about the earlier deed to the nephew, and he told the purchaser that he planned to tear it up, but the uncle never did so. The purchaser properly recorded her deed. The uncle died the following year, leaving the nephew as his sole surviving heir. The friend thereupon delivered the uncle's deed to the nephew, which was the first time the nephew knew of the deed. A statute of the jurisdiction in which the land is located provides: "No conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value and without notice whose conveyance is first recorded according to law." The deed from the uncle to the purchaser was:
987	The owner of a small business was injured in a traffic accident. A month after the accident, the owner asked an employee to take a photograph of the intersection where the accident occurred. The employee took the photograph and gave it to the owner, who in turn gave it to his lawyer. The lawyer wishes to introduce the photograph into evidence at trial of the owner's lawsuit against the defendant. The lawyer plans to have the employee testify that he took the photograph. The lawyer also plans to call a witness who lives in the neighborhood of the accident scene and arrived at the intersection shortly after the accident occurred. The witness is willing to testify that the scene in the photograph is in fact the intersection where the accident happened. Whose testimony is necessary to introduce the photograph into evidence?
988	A missile company was engaged in research and development of an interplanetary space shuttle, under contract with the United States government. Over a period of years, it developed the prototype of a huge, solid-fuel rocket engine for use in this program. To evaluate the performance of this engine, it conducted a static test of the engine at a remote desert test site. The rocket engine was mounted on a concrete test stand, with the thrust of the engine directed downward into the ground. When the engine was fired up, huge clouds of flame and smoke filled the air, and particles of debris from the rocket fell onto an adjoining farm. If the farmer files an action against the company for trespass, which of the following facts, if proved, would be most helpful to the company in avoiding liability?
989	The order department of a machine tools manufacturing company received a phone call from a factory owner who placed an order for two of the company's standard "Type-A" machines. The factory owner and the company came to an oral agreement whereby the total price for both machines was agreed to be $10,000. The first machine was to be delivered on May 1, with payment of $5,000 due 30 days after delivery, and the second machine was to be delivered on June 1 on the same terms (payment of $5,000 due 30 days after delivery). Although the company did not carry the machine in stock, no retooling was required because the Type-A machine was a standard model. The first machine was duly delivered on May 1. The second machine arrived on June 1, but the factory owner refused to accept delivery and also refused to pay for the first machine. The company sued the factory owner on June 2. Assume that it cost the company $3,000 to manufacture each Type-A machine, and that the company could resell the machine for only $3,000. What damages should be awarded aside from any incidental damages?
990	In a negligence action against two joint tortfeasors, the jury determined that the plaintiff suffered $100,000 in damages and that she was 10% at fault. The first defendant was judged to be 60% at fault and to have suffered $200,000 in damages. The second defendant was judged to be 30% at fault and to have suffered no damages. If all parties assert their respective valid claims and the plaintiff ends up with an award of $40,000 from the first defendant, which of the following statements is most likely to be true?
991	Talbot and Rogers, as lessees, signed a valid lease for a house. Lane, the landlord, duly executed the lease and delivered possession of the premises to the lessees. During the term of the lease, Rogers verbally invited Andrews to share the house with the lessees. Andrews agreed to pay part of the rent to Lane, who did not object to this arrangement, despite a provision in the lease that provided that "any assignment, subletting or transfer of any rights under this lease without the express written consent of the landlord is strictly prohibited, null, and void." Talbot objected to Andrews' moving in, even if Andrews were to pay a part of the rent. When Andrews moved in, Talbot brought an appropriate action against Lane, Rogers, and Andrews for a declaratory judgment that Rogers had no right to assign. Rogers' defense was that he and Talbot were tenants in common of a term for years, and that he, Rogers, had a right to assign a fractional interest in his undivided one-half interest. In this action, Talbot will
992	A geologist was studying the land formations in and around a mountain. One day, he opened a newspaper to find that he was in an ad for a brand of cigarettes. The ad headline "quoted" the geologist as saying, "They make you feel like you're in the mountains." The geologist is certain that it is his picture, but he never posed for the ad for the cigarettes. The geologist brings an action to recover damages against the cigarette company. Most likely his best cause of action is:
993	In which of the following cases is a conviction of the named defendant for robbery LEAST likely to be upheld?
994	Insurance is provided in the state of Shoshone only by private companies. Although the state insurance commissioner inspects insurance companies for solvency, the state does not regulate their rates or policies. An insurance company charges higher rates for burglary insurance to residents of one part of a county in Shoshone than to residents of another section of the same county because of the different crime rates in those areas. Foster is a resident of that county who was charged the higher rate by the insurance company because of the location of her residence. Foster sues the insurance company, alleging that the differential in insurance rates unconstitutionally denies her the equal protection of the laws. Will Foster's suit succeed?
995	A man committed a particularly brutal series of crimes that, because of their interstate character, were violations of a federal criminal statute. The man was convicted in federal court and sentenced to life imprisonment. Six months after the man was incarcerated, the President pardoned him. There was a great public outcry, amid charges that the President issued the pardon because the man's uncle had made a large contribution to the President's reelection campaign fund. Responding to public opinion, Congress passed a bill limiting the President's power to pardon persons convicted under the specific statute that the man had violated. The President vetoed the bill, but three-quarters of the members of each house voted to override the veto. The legislation is:
996	Doe, the governor of State, signed a death warrant for Rend, a convicted murderer. Able and Baker are active opponents of the death penalty. At a demonstration protesting the execution of Rend, Able and Baker carried large signs that stated, "Governor Doe - Murderer." Television station XYZ broadcast news coverage of the demonstration, including pictures of the signs carried by Able and Baker. If Governor Doe asserts a defamation claim against XYZ, will Doe prevail?
997	Oker owned in fee simple two adjoining lots, Lots 1 and 2. He conveyed in fee simple Lot 1 to Frank. The deed was in usual form of a warranty deed with the following provision inserted in the appropriate place: "Grantor, for himself, his heirs and assigns, does covenant and agree that any reasonable expense incurred by grantee, his heirs and assigns, as the result of having to repair the retaining wall presently situated on Lot 1 at the common boundary with Lot 2, shall be reimbursed one-half the costs of repairs; and by this provision the parties intend a covenant running with the land." Frank conveyed Lot 1 in fee simple to Sara by warranty deed in usual and regular form. The deed omitted any reference to the retaining wall or any covenant. Fifty years after Oker's conveyance to Frank, Sara conveyed Lot 1 in fee simple to Tim by warranty deed in usual form; this deed omitted any reference to the retaining wall or the covenant. There is no statute that applies to any aspect of the problems presented except a recording act and a statute providing for acquisition of title after ten years of adverse possession. All conveyances by deeds were for a consideration equal to fair market value. The deed from Oker to Frank was never recorded. All other deeds were promptly and properly recorded. Lot 2 is now owned by Henry, who took by intestate succession from Oker, now dead. Tim expended $3,500 on the retaining wall. Then he obtained all of the original deeds in the chain from Oker to him. Shortly thereafter, Tim discovered the covenant in Oker's deed to Frank. He demanded that Henry pay $1,750, and when Henry refused, Tim instituted an appropriate action to recover that sum from Henry. In such action, Henry asserted all defenses available to him. If judgment is for Henry, it will be because
998	Potts sued Dobbs on a product liability claim. Louis testified for Potts. On cross-examination, which of the following questions is the trial judge most likely to rule improper?
999	Pat sustained personal injuries in a three-car collision caused by the concurrent negligence of the three drivers, Pat, Donald, and Drew. In Pat's action for damages against Donald and Drew, the jury apportioned the negligence 30% to Pat, 30% to Donald, and 40% to Drew. Pat's total damages were $100,000. Assume for this question only that a state statute provides for a system of pure comparative negligence, joint and several liability of concurrent tortfeasors, and contribution based upon proportionate fault. If Pat chooses to execute against Donald alone, she will be entitled to collect at most
1000	On August 1, the owner of a hardware store noticed that he was running low on half-inch carriage bolts and their corresponding nuts. He called a screw manufacturer and ordered 1,000 half-inch carriage bolts and nuts to be delivered by August 15. On August 15, the 1,000 bolts were delivered, but the nuts were missing. The store owner called the manufacturer and was told that they had been temporarily out of nuts when they had filled his order, and had reduced the amount he owed to reflect this, as they had done in the past with him in similar circumstances. The store owner protested and the manufacturer offered to send the nuts by overnight carrier so that he would get them the next day. May the store owner cancel the contract?
1001	In its lead editorial in the Sunday edition, a suburban daily newspaper characterized a real estate developer as a "common thief." The developer promptly filed suit against the newspaper for defamation. During the course of the presentation of the plaintiff's case, he sought to put a witness on the stand who is prepared to testify that the plaintiff once saved the life of a fellow soldier in Vietnam. If the newspaper's lawyer objects, the court should rule that the testimony is:
1002	A landowner owned a parcel of land in the mountains. His will devised the parcel to "my nephew, his heirs and assigns, so long as it is used for camping and recreational purposes, otherwise to the underprivileged youth club." The residuary clause of his will left all his property not devised in the remainder of the will to his daughter, who was also his sole heir when he died. His daughter died intestate a few years later, leaving a son (the landowner's grandson) as her only heir. The jurisdiction's decisional law follows the common law Rule Against Perpetuities, and a statute provides that future estates and interests are alienable, and may be devised or inherited, all in the same manner as possessory estates or interests. Which of the following best describes the interests of the grandson and the underprivileged youth club in the parcel?
1003	Cars driven by the plaintiff and the defendant collided, and the defendant was charged with driving while intoxicated in connection with the accident. She pleaded guilty and was merely fined, although, under the statute, the court could have sentenced her to two years in prison. Thereafter, the plaintiff, alleging that the defendant's intoxication had caused the collision, sued the defendant for damages. At trial, the plaintiff offers the properly authenticated record of the defendant's conviction. The record should be:
1004	A pop musician of modest fame offered to sell his first guitar, the one he played as a teenager before he became famous, to a devoted fan for $2,000. The fan paid the musician $50 to keep the offer open for 60 days. Thirty days later, the musician suddenly died. The administrator of his estate found a copy of the agreement and informed the fan that the offer was revoked. Nevertheless, after the value of the musician's paraphernalia skyrocketed due to his death, the fan contacted the administrator to proceed with the sale for $2,000 just before the 60-day period expired. At that time the value of the guitar was estimated to be $50,000. The administrator refused to sell the guitar to the fan for $2,000, so the fan sued the estate for breach of contract. Is the court likely to rule in the fan's favor?
1005	A city entered into a contract with a cable and Internet provider allowing the provider to be the exclusive cable and Internet provider in the city in exchange for certain rights. To facilitate installation of the provider's fiber optic cables for all of the city's residents, the city passed an ordinance requiring all apartment owners to allow the provider to install cables in their buildings. Installation of the cables involved drilling a hole in one exterior wall of the building and running the cables between the interior walls of the buildings. The owner of an apartment building within the city did not want to allow new cables to be installed in his building, as he had gone through a similar process with another company three years earlier and he believed that the other company had damaged his property. To deter the installation, the owner filed suit against the city, claiming that the ordinance amounts to a taking under federal law. How should the court rule?
1006	A pedestrian walking along an unpaved road on his way to work saw a school bus coming in the opposite direction suddenly begin to careen toward him. The bus driver had momentarily lost control of the bus while attempting to light a cigarette. To avoid being hit by the bus, the pedestrian jumped off the road into a landowner's yard. Unfortunately, he landed in a bed of prizewinning zinnias and damaged them extensively. In a suit by the landowner against the bus driver for the damages to her zinnias:
1007	A hockey player who was playing in the final game of the season before a hostile crowd in the opponent's packed stadium had an opportunity to get his team into the playoffs, but he missed a shot into an open net as the horn sounded, ending the game. As the crowd cheered and jeered, the puck bounced back to him and he shot it in anger toward the stands. A fan who had been looking the other way turned back toward the rink just in time to be struck in the face by the puck. He suffered a broken nose and a severe gash under his eye. After the game, the league commissioner fined the player for violating league rules by intentionally directing the puck out of the playing area. If the fan sues the player for battery, will the fan likely prevail?
1008	A distributor of electric toy trains and a hobby shop owner entered into a written contract providing that the distributor will tender to the shop owner four dozen of a popular electric train set at a price of $100 apiece, to be delivered no later than October 31, to take advantage of the holiday shopping season. The shop owner chose to order from this distributor because its price for the train set was lower than that of other distributors. Shortly after the shop owner placed his order, the distributor raised its prices due to a sudden surge in popularity of that train set. Because the distributor did not have enough train sets to accommodate everyone due to the surge of orders, it decided to deliver train sets only to those buyers who had ordered them at the increased price. The distributor notified the shop owner that it would not deliver the train sets it ordered. The shop owner filed an action to force the distributor to deliver the train sets at the agreed-upon price. Will the court compel the distributor to deliver the train sets to the shop owner?
1009	A carload of gang members, armed with automatic rifles, sped into the rival gang's neighborhood looking for a store that its rival gang used as a hangout. The gang members knew that the store closed at 6 p.m. and that the rival gang went elsewhere after nightfall. As the gang members drove by, they sprayed the store with bullets. One of the bullets struck and killed a six-year-old girl who was asleep in an apartment located on the second floor above the corner store. A few days later, the police arrested the defendant, who admitted to being a member of the gang and to having been in the car when the gang members shot up the store. The defendant was placed on trial for the girl's murder. If the defendant takes the stand in his own defense, and the jury believes the defendant's testimony, which of the following assertions by the defendant would be his best defense to the murder charge?
1010	A state required that, in order to practice medicine in that state, a physician must not only hold a license there but also be a resident of the state for at least one year. A physician who held a license in that state but who had been temporarily residing in another state returned to live in the state and immediately began to practice medicine there. The state sanctioned the physician for violating the residency requirement. The physician brought suit, alleging that the residency requirement violated the United States Constitution. The physician will:
1011	During 1976 a series of arsons, one of which damaged the Humongous Store, occurred in the City of Swelter. In early 1977 Swelter's City Council adopted this resolution: The City will pay $10,000 for the arrest and conviction of anyone guilty of any of the 1976 arsons committed here. The foregoing was telecast by the city's sole television station once daily for one week. Subsequently, Humongous, by a written memorandum to Gimlet, a private detective, proposed to pay Gimlet $200 "for each day 's work you actually perform in investigating our fire." Thereafter, in August, 1977, the City Council by resolution repealed its reward offer and caused this resolution to be broadcast once daily for a week over two local radio stations, the local television station having meanwhile ceased operations. In September, 1977, a Humongous employee voluntarily confessed to Gimlet to having committed all of the 1976 arsons. Humongous' president thereupon paid Gimlet at the proposed daily rate for his investigation and suggested that Gimlet also claim the city's reward, of which Gimlet had been previously unaware. Gimlet immediately made the claim. In December, 1977, as a result of Gimlet's investigation, the Humongous employee was convicted of burning the store. The city, which has no immunity to suit, has since refused to pay Gimlet anything, although he swears that he never heard of the city's repealer before claiming its reward. In which of the following ways could the city's reward offer be effectively accepted?
1012	A state study indicated that an inordinately high percentage of homeless in the state were afflicted by alcoholism or addiction to illegal drugs. The legislature therefore decided to levy a special tax, with all proceeds marked for rehabilitative services for the homeless. However, the legislators determined that direct taxes on alcoholic beverages would be resented by the citizenry. Lobbyists from the state's growing wine industry also objected to anything that would retard the industry's development. There were no breweries or distilleries within the state. Thus, a tax was eventually passed requiring newspapers and magazines of general circulation published in the state to be taxed at a rate of 20% on all advertising space sold for beer or distilled spirits promotions. For certain historical reasons, a high proportion of the advertising revenue of a particular small newspaper within the state came from beer and wine ads. The publisher of the small paper filed suit to have the tax declared unconstitutional. A major wholesale beer and liquor distributor located within the state and several out-of-state brewers and distillers who sold and advertised their products in the state also joined in the suit as plaintiffs. If the tax is declared unconstitutional, it will most likely be because:
1013	On December 1, a landlord rented an apartment to a tenant for one year, commencing January 1. The tenant paid a security deposit and the first month's rent. As the tenant was aware, an occupant resided in the apartment with a lease on the premises until December 31. The occupant refused to leave the apartment on December 31, and the landlord served the appropriate legal notices to vacate the premises. The occupant did not vacate the apartment until January 31, forcing the tenant to stay in more expensive housing during the interim. If the tenant now sues the landlord for damages resulting from the delay in the tenant's possession of the premises, which of the following would provide the tenant with the best argument?
1014	The owner of a car sold it to a purchaser. The seller had previously bought four new tires for the car from a tire shop and had put 2,000 additional miles on the car before she sold it. The purchaser of the car immediately took it on a long trip, often driving it over the posted limit. As he approached his destination, he was driving 10 m.p.h. over the speed limit when his left front tire suddenly blew out because of a defect. The car went out of control, crashed into another vehicle, and the purchaser was severely injured. The defect in the tires could have been discovered by the seller by a reasonable inspection at the time she selected them. If the purchaser sues the seller on a strict liability theory, the purchaser should:
1015	Acting on an anonymous telephone call, police went to Desmond's apartment, knocked on the door, and demanded to search it for narcotics. When Desmond refused, the police forced the door open and placed him under arrest. As they were removing him from the apartment, Desmond offered to give the officers "valuable information" in exchange for his release. Before he could say anything else, Desmond was given Miranda warnings by the police. Thereafter he told the police that he had stored some heroin in his friend's apartment and that he and his friend had been going to sell it. The heroin was recovered, and Desmond was prosecuted for conspiracy to sell narcotics and for possession of narcotics. At his trial, Desmond moved to suppress his statements. Which of the following is Desmond's best argument in support of the motion to suppress?
1016	There is high and persistent unemployment in an industrialized state. Its legislature therefore enacted a statute requiring every business with annual sales in the state of over $1 million to purchase each year goods and/or services in the state equal in value to at least half of its sales in the state. Which of the following parties most clearly has standing to contest the constitutionality of this state statute in federal court?
1017	At the defendant's prosecution for robbery of a drugstore, the main prosecution witness testified that the defendant had asked her to drive him to the town where the drugstore was located. The witness testified that the defendant did not explain his purpose for going to the town, and that he had stopped at a relative's house along the way to pick up a bundle that could have been the sawed-off shotgun used by the robber. On cross-examination, the defendant's attorney asked a number of pointed questions of the witness, implying that the defendant had asked her to drive to the town so that he could visit relatives there and suggesting that the witness had obtained a sawed-off shotgun for use by a confederate. The defendant did not testify on his own behalf. In final argument, the prosecutor called the jury's attention to the two versions of events suggested by the witness's testimony on direct examination and the defense attorney's questions on cross-examination, and then said, "Remember, you only heard one of the two people testify who know what really happened that day." If the defendant is convicted of robbery, his conviction will probably be:
1018	Motorco is a manufacturer of motor vehicles. A federal regulation requires that all motor vehicles manufactured for sale in the United States be equipped with seat belts for each passenger and prescribes specifications for such belts. Motorco equipped all its cars with seat belts. It purchased all the bolts used in its seat belt assemblies from Boltco and it tested samples from each shipment received. Dunn purchased a motor vehicle manufactured by Motorco. While operating the car, with Price as a passenger in the front seat, Dunn collided with another vehicle. The collision was due solely to Dunn's negligence. Price had his seat belt fastened, but one of the bolts which anchored the belt to the frame broke. Price was thrown through the windshield, sustaining various injuries. Dunn, whose belt was fastened and held, was killed when, following the collision, the car went off the road, down an embankment, and overturned. Subsequent to the accident, tests of the bolt that broke showed metallurgical defects. Motorco's records showed that tests of samples from the shipment in which the defective bolt was received revealed no defective bolts. In a negligence action by Price against Motorco, the negligence of Dunn will be considered to be
1019	A buyer for a chain of shoe stores ordered 1,000 pairs of shoes from a shoe manufacturer. The shoes cost $50 per pair, so the total contract price was $50,000. It happened that the manufacturer owed $50,000 to a trucking company. The manufacturer assigned, in writing, "all proceeds from the contract with the buyer" to the trucking company. The manufacturer notified the buyer that he had assigned the proceeds of the contract to the trucking company and then shipped the 1,000 pairs of shoes to the buyer. Upon receipt of the shoes, the buyer discovered that 10% of the shoes were defective. He sent a check for 90% of the contract price ($45,000) to the manufacturer, who deposited the check. Shortly thereafter, the manufacturer closed down its business and disappeared without a trace. The trucking company, meanwhile, demanded payment from the buyer, to no avail. If the trucking company sues the buyer for the $45,000 that the buyer paid on the contract, will the trucking company prevail?
1020	Drew, the owner of a truck leasing company, asked Pat, one of Drew's employees, to deliver $1,000 to the dealership's main office. The following week, as a result of a dispute over whether the money had been delivered, Drew instructed Pat to come to the office to submit to a lie detector test. When Pat reported to Drew's office for the test, it was not administered. Instead, without hearing Pat's story, Drew shouted at him, "You're a thief!" and fired him. Drew's shout was overheard by several other employees who were in another office, which was separated from Drew's office by a thin partition. The next day, Pat accepted another job at a higher salary. Several weeks later, upon discovering that the money had not been stolen, Drew offered to rehire Pat. In a suit for slander by Pat against Drew, Pat will
1021	Gourmet, a famous chef, entered into a written agreement with his friend Deligor, a well-known interior decorator respected for his unique designs, in which Deligor agreed, for a fixed fee, to design the interior of Gourmet's new restaurant, and, upon Gourmet's approval of the design plan, to decorate and fumish the restaurant accordingly. The agreement was silent as to assignment or delegation by either party. Before beginning the work, Deligor sold his decorating business to Newman under an agreement in which Deligor assigned to Newman, and Newman agreed to complete, the Gourmet- Deligor contract. Newman, also an experienced decorator of excellent repute, advised Gourmet of the assignment, and supplied him with information confirming both Newman's financial responsibility and past commercial success. Is Gourmet obligated to permit Newman to perform the Gourmet-Deligor agreement?
1022	A racehorse breeder and a stable owner entered into a written agreement giving the stable owner the option to purchase all colts foaled out of a particular champion racehorse during the next three years. The agreement provided that price would be determined on the basis of sex, weight, height, and bone structure at time of delivery. Six months later, the first colt was born to the horse, and it had all the markings of a champion. The stable owner immediately tendered $25,000 to the breeder for the colt, which was a good faith approximation of its value. However, the breeder refused to deliver the colt unless the stable owner paid $100,000. The stable owner sued the breeder. If the breeder defends on the ground that there is no enforceable contract obligating him to sell, the court would most likely hold:
1023	A city council passed an ordinance providing: "No person may contribute more than $100 annually to any group organized for the specific purpose of supporting or opposing referenda to be voted on by the city electorate or regularly engaging in such activities." If the ordinance is challenged in federal court, how should the court rule on the constitutionality of this ordinance?
1024	An owner purchased a home in a new subdivision, paying 20% of the purchase price as a down payment and financing the rest of her purchase through a mortgage with a lender. The owner lived in her home for three years and always made her mortgage payments promptly. She then decided to put her house on the market. While the house was being marketed, the owner continued to make all mortgage payments promptly. She sold the house to a buyer, who purchased the property subject to the mortgage. After the buyer took possession, the lender received no further mortgage payments from either the owner or the buyer. In most states, which of the following best describes the remedy or remedies available to the lender?
1025	A contractor with a contract to deepen a well in a drought-stricken area mistakenly entered onto the wrong property and proceeded to deepen the well there. The owner of the property saw the contractor at work but said nothing. When the contractor completed the job, the property owner refused to pay his bill, and the contractor filed suit. In her answer, the property owner stated that she thought the contractor was employed by the county and that the government was paying for the work because of the drought. She knew, however, that two of her neighbors had recently paid private contractors to deepen their wells. Which of the following arguments offers the contractor his best chance for winning his lawsuit'?
1026	On March 1, Zeller orally agreed to sell his land, Homestead, to Byer for $46,000 to be paid on March 31. Byer orally agreed to pay $25,000 of the purchase price to Quincy in satisfaction of a debt which Zeller said he had promised to pay Quincy. On March 10, Byer dictated the agreement to his secretary but omitted all reference to the payment of the $25,000 to Quincy. In typing the agreement, the secretary mistakenly typed in $45,000 rather than $46,000 as the purchase price. Neither Byer nor Zeller carefully read the writing before signing it on March 15. Neither noticed the error in price and neither raised any question concerning omission of the payment to Quincy. If Byer refused to pay more than $45,000 for Homestead, in an action by Zeller against Byer for an additional $1,000, it would be to Zeller's advantage to try to prove that
1027	Old City police officers shot and killed Jones's friend as he attempted to escape arrest for an armed robbery he had committed. Jones brought suit in federal district court against the Old City Police Department and the city police officers involved, seeking only a judgment declaring unconstitutional the state statute under which the police acted. That newly enacted statute authorized the police to use deadly force when necessary to apprehend a person who has committed a felony. In his suit, Jones alleged that the police would not have killed his friend if the use of deadly force had not been authorized by the statute. The federal district court should
1028	In July of last summer a grape grower contracted with a winery to deliver "500 tons of premium quality pinot chardonnay grapes grown on my ranch." The price was to be $1,000 per ton and delivery was to be on or before September 15. In August of the same year, the grape grower entered into an identical contract with a vineyard to sell 300 tons of premium quality pinot chardonnay grapes. The grape grower completed his harvest by September 10 and had 800 tons of premium quality grapes. On September 11, an unexpected rain ruined 400 tons, and the grape grower notified the winery and the vineyard on that day that he would only be able to deliver 250 tons to the winery and 150 tons to the vineyard. On September 14, the vineyard purchased an additional 150 tons of premium quality pinot chardonnay grapes from a different grape farmer, one of several other available sources for premium quality pinot chardonnay grapes. These grapes along with the 150 tons from the grape grower gave the vineyard the 300 tons it needed. On September 15, what is the winery's legal position with regard to the grape grower's failure to deliver the 500 tons of grapes required by his contract?
1029	Potts, a building contractor, sued Dennis for failure to pay on a small cost-plus construction contract. At trial, Potts, who personally supervised all of the work, seeks to testify to what he remembers about the amount of pipe used, the number of workers used on the job, and the number of hours spent grading. Dennis objects on the ground that Potts had routinely recorded these facts in notebooks which are in Potts's possession. Potts's testimony is
1030	Larson was charged with the murder of a man who had been strangled and whose body was found in some woods near his home. Larson suffers from a neurological problem that makes it impossible for him to remember an occurrence for longer than 48 hours. After Larson was charged, the police visited him and asked if they might search his home. Larson consented. The police found a diary written by Larson. An entry dated the same day as the victim's disappearance read, "Indescribable excitement. Why did no one ever tell me that killing gave such pleasure to the master?" Larson was charged with murder. His attorney has moved to exclude the diary from evidence on the ground that its admission would violate Larson's privilege against self-incrimination. Counsel has also argued that Larson could not give informed consent to the search because more than 48 hours had passed since the making of the entry and hence he could not remember the existence of the incriminating entry at the time he gave his consent. There is no evidence that the police officers who secured Larson's consent to the search were aware of his memory impairment. With regard to the diary, the court should
1031	In a federal civil trial, Plaintiff wishes to establish that, in a state court, Defendant had been convicted of fraud, a fact that Defendant denies. Which mode of proof of the conviction is LEAST likely to be permitted?
1032	The Kernel Corporation, through its president, Demeter Gritz, requested from Vault Finance, Inc., a short-term loan of $100,000. On April 1, Gritz and Vault's loan officer agreed orally that Vault would make the loan on the following terms: (1) the loan would be repaid in full on or before the following July 1 and would carry interest at an annual rate of 15 percent (a lawful rate under the applicable usury law); and (2) Gritz would personally guarantee repayment. The loan was approved and made on April 5. The only document evidencing the loan was a memorandum, written and supplied by Vault and signed by Gritz for Kernel, that read in its entirety: April 5 In consideration of a loan advanced on this date, Kernel Corporation hereby promises to pay Vault Finance, Inc., $100,000 on September 1. Kernel Corporation By /s /Demeter Gritz Demeter Gritz, President Kernel Corporation did not repay the loan on or before July 1, although it had sufficient funds to do so. On July 10, Vault sued Kernel as principal debtor and Gritz individually as guarantor for $100,000, plus 15 percent interest from April 5. At the trial, can Vault prove Kernel's oral commitment to repay the loan on or before July 1?
1033	The defendant was on trial for armed robbery. The defense placed the defendant's friend on the stand as an alibi witness. The friend testified that, at the time of the armed robbery, the defendant was engaged in other activities with the friend. On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked the friend, "Isn't it true that the grand jury has indicted you for the same crime as the defendant?" The defendant's lawyer knew that the friend had been indicted for the armed robbery and was to be tried separately in two weeks, but she vigorously objected to the prosecutor's question. Her objection should be:
1034	A town with a population of 30,000 merged with a city of 60,000. To protect voting rights of the citizens of the former town, a proposal was made that for a period of 20 years, beginning at the date of the merger, the city council of the merged city would consist of six persons. Each formerly separate municipality would be divided into three council districts. Each district from the former town would have approximately 10,000 residents, and each district from the former city would have 20,000 residents. A mayor would be elected at large. Before this proposal was placed on the ballot, the state attorney general issued an advisory opinion stating that the proposal was not in violation of any state statutory or constitutional provision. The proposal was placed on the ballot and was carried by large majorities in both the town and the city, and the districts were carved out. Three taxpayers filed suit to enjoin the holding of an election with council districts of such disparate proportions. The suit reached the state supreme court, which ruled that the governmental formula was constitutional under both the state and United States Constitutions. The plaintiffs wish to take the case to the United States Supreme Court. The Supreme Court should:
1035	A professor had his laptop computer stolen from his office. He went to a computer resale shop to find a replacement and saw what he mistakenly thought was his computer. He questioned the owner of the shop, who told him that someone had just sold her the computer, but she refused to give him any information about the seller and refused to let him inspect the computer more closely. That night, after the shop was closed, the professor forced open the back door. After turning over the laptop to check the serial number, the professor realized that it was not the one that was stolen from his office. Nonetheless, he decided to keep it. The owner's clerk, who, unbeknownst to the professor lived in a room in the back of the shop, heard someone breaking in and called the police. The professor was arrested as he was exiting the shop and is charged with larceny and burglary in a common law jurisdiction. Of which crimes may he be convicted and sentenced?
1036	A husband decided to kill his wife by poisoning her. He asked his friend, a pharmacist, to obtain some deadly poison, and to give it to him without recording the transaction. Because the pharmacist suspected the husband's motive, she supplied the husband with a small quantity of an antibiotic, instead of the poison. The antibiotic is harmless if administered in small quantities, except for the less than I% of the population who are allergic to the drug. The husband injected his wife with the drug while she slept, and she died from an allergic reaction. The pharmacist is an accomplice to:
1037	Neff and Owens owned adjoining residences in Smithville. In 1971, they hired a contractor to lay sidewalks in front of both of their homes. Each man was to pay the contractor for that part of the work attributable to his property. After he had paid the bill which the contractor had submitted to him, Neff became convinced that the contractor had erred and had charged him for labor and materials which were used for part of the sidewalk in front of Owens' property. Neff thereupon asked Owens to reimburse him for the amount which he assumed he had erroneously paid the contractor. After a lengthy discussion, and although he was still convinced that he owed Neff nothing, Owens finally said: "I want to avoid trouble, and so if you agree not to sue for reimbursement, I'll employ a caretaker for a three-year term to keep our sidewalks free of ice and snow." Neff orally assented. Although he could have hired the man for three years, Owens hired Parsons in October, 1971, to keep the snow and ice off the sidewalks for the winter, November 1971-March 1972. During the early fall of 1972, Owens decided to go to Florida for the winter. He told his nephew, Morse, that he could live in Owens' house for the winter provided Morse would hire someone to keep the snow and ice off the walks in front of both Neff's and Owens' properties, and suggested that Morse could hire Parsons for that task at relatively little cost. Morse moved into Owens' home in October, 1972, but moved out November, 1972, prior to any icing or snowfall. He did not employ anyone to remove snow and ice in front of either property. Owens did not know that Morse had moved out of his home until he returned to Smithville in the spring. During the winter Neff had kept his own walks clean. No one cleaned the snow and ice from the walks in front of Owens' property. Assuming there is an enforceable contract between Owens and Morse, does Neff have an action against Morse?
1038	Due to budget shortages and a critical need of funding to fight a war, Congress enacted a $25 tax on each person flying into an airport in the five most popular vacation destinations in the country, as determined by Congress. The tax was implemented, and officials in the five destinations were outraged, fearing that the number of vacationers to the taxed destinations would decrease due to the tax. If the tax is challenged in federal court by an official with standing, the most likely result is that the tax will be held:
1039	A plaintiff sued a defendant for injuries arising out of a collision between vehicles driven by the parties. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant ran a red light when he struck the plaintiff's vehicle in an intersection. The plaintiff wishes to call a witness to the stand who was near the intersection at the time of the accident. The witness is prepared to testify that the defendant offered to pay the witness $500 to testify falsely in the defendant's favor. Such testimony should be:
1040	At a time when a homeowner held title to a subdivision lot in fee simple, the developer executed a warranty deed conveying the same lot to a purchaser. The deed was promptly and duly recorded. Subsequently, the homeowner conveyed the lot to the developer by a warranty deed that was promptly and duly recorded. Later, the developer conveyed the lot to an investor by a warranty deed, which was promptly and duly recorded. The investor paid the fair market value of the lot and had no knowledge of any claim of the purchaser. In an appropriate action, the investor and the purchaser contest title to the lot. In this action, judgment should be for:
1041	A buyer entered into a contract with a seller to purchase a parcel of land for $140,000. Because the buyer had only fair credit, the buyer was able to obtain financing from a bank only in the amount of $90,000, secured by a mortgage on the land. Due to a clerical error, the bank's mortgage was not immediately recorded. Without notifying the bank, the buyer went to the seller a few days later and obtained a loan for the remaining $50,000, secured by a mortgage on the land. The next day, the bank discovered the error and recorded its mortgage. The following day, the seller recorded his mortgage. A statute in the jurisdiction provides: "No unrecorded conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value without notice, who shall first record." Who has the prior lien?
1042	Dent operates a residential rehabilitation center for emotionally disturbed and ungovernable children who have been committed to his custody by their parents or by juvenile authorities. The center's purpose is to modify the behavior of the children through a teaching program carried out in a family-like environment. Though the children are not permitted to leave the center without his permission, there are no bars or guards to prevent them from doing so. It has been held in the state where the center is located that persons having custody of children have the same duties and responsibilities that they would have if they were the parents of the children. Camden, aged 12, who had been in Dent's custody for six months, left the center without permission. Dent became aware of Camden's absence almost immediately, but made no attempt to locate him or secure his return, though reports reached him that Camden had been seen in the vicinity. Thirty-six hours after Camden left the center, Camden committed a brutal assault upon Pell, a five-year-old child, causing Pell to suffer extensive permanent injury. If an action is brought against Dent on behalf of Pell to recover damages for Pell's injuries, will Pell prevail?
1043	A city passed an ordinance prohibiting doorto-door solicitation of contributions by charitable organizations that did not use at least 75% of their receipts for "charitable purposes." The ordinance further provided that anyone wishing to solicit for purposes of charity must obtain a permit and present satisfactory proof that at least 75% of the proceeds of such solicitation will be used directly for the charitable purposes of the organization. An organization seeking to solicit support within the city applied for and was denied a permit because it did not meet the 75% requirement. As applied to the organization, is the ordinance constitutional?
1044	Congress passed a law allowing widespread oil exploration on federal lands in the western United States. A large deposit of oil sand was discovered in one western state and Congress authorized an oil sand refining plant to be built on federal park land within the state. The refinery was built in compliance with federal pollution regulations. Pursuant to state law, the plant manager allowed the state to inspect the plant before putting it into operation. Because state refinery standards were more strict than the federal standards (in order to better protect state citizens from pollution associated with refineries), the refinery did not pass the inspection, and the state inspector refused to give the manager a permit to run the refinery. The refinery manager nevertheless began to run the refinery and was fined by the state. Which of the following is the manager's best defense against imposition of the fine?
1045	A landowner devised her parcel of land to her daughter, her heirs, and assigns, "so long as the property is used for residential purposes, then to my niece, her heirs, and assigns." The remainder of the landowner's property passed through the residuary clause of her will to her grandson. The daughter lived on the land for 25 years; then, on her death, ownership passed to her husband. In the meantime, the niece had also died, leaving her entire estate to her son. The husband has leased the land to a developer, who has obtained the necessary permits to build a shopping center on it. The grandson and the niece's son both file quiet title and ejectment actions against the husband, and the cases are consolidated. How should the court, applying common law, rule as to ownership of the land?
1046	Park sued Dunlevy for copyright infringement for using in Dunlevy's book some slightly disguised house plans on which Park held the copyright. Park is prepared to testify that he heard Dunlevy's executive assistant for copyright matters say that Dunlevy had obtained an advance copy of the plans from Park's office manager. Park's testimony is
1047	The father of a girl whose horse crashed through a neighbor's fence told the neighbor that he would have the fence repaired immediately at his cost. The father hired a local contractor to do the work. The contractor did a poor job and did not fix the fence properly. Assuming that there was an enforceable agreement between the father and the neighbor, would the neighbor have an action against the contractor?
1048	Dooley was a pitcher for the City Robins, a professional baseball team. While Dooley was throwing warm-up pitches on the sidelines during a game, he was continuously heckled by some spectators seated in the stands above the dugout behind a wire mesh fence. On several occasions, Dooley turned and looked directly at the hecklers with a scowl on his face, but the heckling continued. Dooley wound up as though he was preparing to pitch in the direction of his catcher; however the ball traveled from his hand at high speed, at a 90-degree angle from the line to the catcher and directly toward the hecklers in the stands. The ball passed through the wire mesh fence and struck Patricia, one of the hecklers. Patricia brought an action for damages against Dooley and the City Robins, based upon negligence and battery. The trial court directed a verdict for the defendants on the battery count. The jury found for the defendants on the negligence count because the jury determined that Dooley could not foresee that the ball would pass through the wire mesh fence. Patricia has appealed the judgments on the battery counts, contending that the trial court erred in directing verdicts for Dooley and the City Robins. On appeal, the judgment entered on the directed verdict in Dooley's favor on the battery claim should be
1049	In response to growing concern over public health issues, Congress passed legislation permitting states to completely ban the sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products. The legislation was subsequently upheld by the United States Supreme Court. Following the lead of other states, a state legislature declined to enact a complete ban on tobacco products. However, it passed a compromise measure that banned all ads for cigarettes and tobacco products by any print or broadcast media located in the state. A state tobacco distributor that wished to advertise in local newspapers brings an action in federal court to challenge the state statute. The court will probably find the statute:
1050	A young child was using real fireworks to blow up his toy tanks in his backyard during a pretend game of war while his father was in the house. The child was severely injured when one firework exploded in his hand. The child's mother, as guardian ad litem, brought an action against the fireworks manufacturer to recover for the child's injuries and medical expenses. The fireworks manufacturer defended on the ground that the child's father was negligent in supervising the child. The jurisdiction has abolished parent-child tort immunity. Any negligence on the father's part will:
1051	A hiker was passing by an isolated farmhouse one evening when she noticed flames coming from a shed attached to the house, which was dark and apparently unoccupied at the moment. The property on which the house was located was protected by a barbed wire fence, but the hiker happened to have a pair of wire cutters with her, so she cut through the barbed wire fence and entered the property. She put out the fire with a garden hose before it spread to the house. The hiker is:
1052	Congress enacted a law requiring all civil service employees to retire by age 75, except when such employees are employed by the armed services. Civil service employees of the armed services are required to retire by age 65. An employee of the armed services just turned 65 years old. He files suit in the federal district court seeking a declaratory judgment that would prevent his employer from requiring him to retire before age 75. The employee's strongest argument in support that the statute's provisions regarding civil service employees of the armed services are invalid is that this provision:
1053	A man was tried in state court for possession of heroin. The prosecution offered in evidence five rolled-up toy balloons containing heroin, which police officers had found on a table in the man's apartment. At a hearing on the defense motion to suppress, testimony was presented that established that the police had put the apartment under surveillance, and had watched a police informant go to the door of the apartment, hand four balloons of heroin to the man, and leave. The police had then knocked on the apartment door, identified themselves as police officers, and demanded entrance. Having heard nothing for 30 seconds, the police had then broken down the door and entered the apartment, discovering the heroin. The police had intended to arrest the man for the purchase of heroin, a felony. When they had gotten inside the apartment, they discovered that the man had left by a back exit. He was later arrested at the nearby newsstand. The trial court denied the motion to suppress, and the case is on appeal following the man's conviction for possession of heroin. The appellate court should:
1054	The plaintiff brought suit against a train company for the death of her husband, a passenger on a train that crashed, alleging that her husband died due to the negligence of the defendant. Immediately after the crash, an agent from a federal transportation safety board investigated the accident. The agent issued a report concluding that the accident occurred due to the engineer operating the train at an excessive speed. The plaintiff seeks to admit into evidence the report. The defendant objects on the ground that the report is hearsay. How should the court rule?
1055	A farmer was in the middle of plowing his field when his tractor broke down. While attempting to repair it, he discovered that he needed a special wrench. He knew that his neighbor used the same type of tractor and kept a large cache of tools in his basement. Not wanting to make the long drive into town to buy one wrench that he probably would not use much, the farmer went to his neighbor's house to borrow the wrench. However, no one was home so he decided to look in his neighbor's basement for the wrench, thinking that he would return it before the neighbor came back. To gain entry, the farmer opened an unlocked window and climbed through the opening to the basement. Once inside, the farmer found the tool and took it with him to work on the tractor. His neighbor returned soon after and contacted the police when he discovered that one of his tools was missing. The police determined that the farmer took the tool and he was charged with burglary. What is the farmer's best defense against that charge in a common law jurisdiction?
1056	Dryden is tried on a charge of driving while intoxicated. When Dryden was booked at the police station, a videotape was made that showed him unsteady, abusive, and speaking in a slurred manner. If the prosecutor lays a foundation properly identifying the tape, should the court admit it in evidence and permit it to be shown to the jury?
1057	Vance had cheated Dodd in a card game. Angered, Dodd set out for Vance's house with the intention of shooting him. Just as he was about to set foot on Vance's property, Dodd was arrested by a police officer who noticed that Dodd was carrying a revolver. A statute in the jurisdiction makes it a crime to "enter the property of another with the intent to commit any crime of violence thereon." If charged with attempting to violate the statute, Dodd should be found
1058	A duly enacted federal statute sets aside a $5 million grant to study whether after-school dance classes could help prevent teenagers from joining gangs. A nonpartisan taxpayer's group, dedicated to restoring fiscal integrity in the federal government, has filed suit in federal court against appropriate federal officials to enjoin their expenditure of the $5 million provided by the statute. The suit challenges the statute as an improper exercise of congressional power. Which of the following best reflects the likely result of the case on a proper challenge?
1059	There is high and persistent unemployment in the industrialized state of Green. Its legislature therefore enacted a statute requiring every business with annual sales in Green of over $1 million to purchase each year goods and/or services in Green equal in value to at least half of its sales in Green. Which of the following parties most clearly has standing to contest the constitutionality of this statute of Green in federal court?
1060	A state law provides free school lunches for elementary school students whose family incomes are below poverty level. A local white supremacist group has organized a private elementary school that denies admission to all non-Caucasians. Most of the school's students are living below poverty level and the school officials have demanded that free lunch service be provided by the state. Which of the following is the strongest argument against the constitutionality of the state law as applied to providing free lunch to the students at the school?
1061	A store ordered $2,000 worth of clocks from a large clock supplier. The day before the clocks were delivered to the store, while the clocks were in the hands of a carrier, the supplier learned that the store was insolvent. The supplier contacted the store and told its owner that it would not be making the delivery due to the store's insolvency. The store owner told the supplier that he would pay cash for the clocks at the time of delivery, but the supplier still refused to make the delivery. If the store sues the supplier for breach of contract, the store will:
1062	By a writing, Oner leased his home, Blackacre, to Tenn for a term of three years, ending December 31 of last year, at the rent of $1,000 per month. The lease provided that Tenn could sublet and assign. Tenn lived in Blackacre for one year and paid the rent promptly. After one year, Tenn leased Blackacre to Agrit for one year at a rent of $1,000 per month. Agrit took possession of Blackacre and lived there for six months but, because of her unemployment, paid no rent. After six months, on June 30 Agrit abandoned Blackacre, which remained vacant for the balance of that year. Tenn again took possession of Blackacre at the beginning of the third and final year of the term but paid Oner no rent. At the end of the lease term, Oner brought an appropriate action against both Tenn and Agrit to recover $24,000, the unpaid rent. In such action Oner is entitled to a judgment
1063	Anna owned Blackacre, which was improved with a dwelling. Beth owned Whiteacre, an adjoining unimproved lot suitable for constructing a dwelling. Beth executed and delivered a deed granting to Anna an easement over the westerly 15 feet of Whiteacre for convenient ingress and egress to a public street, although Anna's lot did abut another public street. Anna did not then record Beth's deed. After Anna constructed and started using a driveway within the described 15-foot strip in a clearly visible manner, Beth borrowed $10,000 cash from Bank and gave Bank a mortgage on Whiteacre. The mortgage was promptly and properly recorded. Anna then recorded Beth's deed granting the easement. Beth subsequently defaulted on her loan payments to Bank. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides: "No conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value and without notice unless the same be recorded according to law." In an appropriate foreclosure action as to Whiteacre, brought against Anna and Beth, Bank seeks, among other things, to have Anna's easement declared subordinate to Bank's mortgage, so that the easement will be terminated by completion of the foreclosure. If Anna's easement is NOT terminated, it will be because
1064	A state statute requires any person licensed to sell prescription drugs to file with the State Board of Health a report listing the types and amounts of such drugs sold if his sales of such drugs exceed $50,000 during a calendar year. The statute makes it a misdemeanor to "knowingly fail to file" such a report. Nelson, who is licensed to sell prescription drugs, sold $63,000 worth of prescription drugs during 1976 but did not file the report. Charged with committing the misdemeanor, Nelson testifies that he did a very poor job of keeping records and did not realize that his sales of prescription drugs had exceeded $50,000. If the jury believes Nelson, he should be found
1065	In which of the following cases would an objection to a leading question most likely be upheld?
1066	A state statute has detailed classifications of civil servants for both state and city positions. It provides that all civil servants who have been employed for over 18 months may be dismissed only for "misconduct" and also requires that state and city agencies comply with all procedures set forth in any personnel handbook issued by that agency. The personnel handbook of the state tollway authority sets forth detailed procedures for dismissal of civil servant employees. The handbook provides that written notice of the grounds for dismissal must be given to the employee prior to dismissal, and that the employee must, on request, be granted a postdismissal hearing within three months after the dismissal takes effect. An employee is entitled to present witnesses and evidence at the postdismissal hearing, and is entitled to reinstatement and back pay if the hearing board decides that the employer has not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the dismissal was justified. A state tollway employee who had been employed for three years recently was fired. After an investigation by state auditors, the employee was notified by registered letter that he was being dismissed because of evidence that he took bribes from construction firms in exchange for steering contracts to them. He was informed of his right to a hearing and requested one as soon as possible. Three weeks after his dismissal, the state personnel board conducted a hearing at which the employee denied the charges and presented witnesses to attest to his honesty. At the conclusion of the hearing, the board upheld his dismissal, finding that it was supported by a preponderance of the evidence. If the employee files suit in federal court challenging his dismissal on constitutional grounds, will he be likely to prevail?
1067	Roofer entered into a written contract with Orissa to repair the roof of Orissa's home, the repairs to be done "in a workmanlike manner." Roofer completed the repairs and took all of his equipment away, with the exception of a 20-foot extension ladder, which was left against the side of the house. He intended to come back and get the ladder the next morning. At that time, Orissa and her family were away on a trip. During the night, a thief, using the ladder to gain access to an upstairs window, entered the house and stole some valuable jewels. Orissa has asserted a claim against Roofer for damages for the loss of the jewels. In her claim against Roofer, Orissa will
1068	Star, who played the lead role in a television soap opera, was seriously injured in an automobile accident caused by Danton's negligent driving. As a consequence of Star's injury, the television series was canceled, and Penn, a supporting actor, was laid off. In an action against Danton, can Penn recover for his loss of income attributable to the accident?
1069	A statute of the state of Orrington provides that assessments of real property for tax purposes must represent the "actual value" of the property. The Blue County Tax Commission, in making its assessments, has uniformly and consistently determined the "actual value" of real property solely by reference to the price at which the particular property was last sold. In recent years, the market values of real property in Blue County have been rising at the rate of 15% per year. Owner is required to pay real estate taxes on her home in Blue County that are 200% to 300% higher than those paid by many other owners of similar homes in similar neighborhoods in that county, even though the current market values of their respective homes and Owner's home are nearly identical. The reason the taxes on Owner's home are higher than those imposed on the other similar homes in similar neighborhoods is that she bought her home much more recently than the other owners and, therefore, it is assessed at a much higher "actual value" than their homes. Persistent efforts by Owner to have her assessment reduced or the assessments of the others raised by the Blue County Tax Commission have failed. Owner has now filed suit against the Blue County Tax Commission, charging only that the tax assessment on her property is unconstitutional. The strongest constitutional argument to support Owner's claim is that the comparative overvaluation of Owner's property by the Blue County Tax Commission in making tax assessments over time
1070	Section 1 of the Vehicle Code of State makes it illegal to cross a street in a central business district other than at a designated crosswalk. Section 2 of the Code prohibits parking any motor vehicle so that it blocks any part of a designated crosswalk. Ped wanted to cross Main Street in the central business district of City, located in State, but a truck parked by Trucker was blocking the designated crosswalk. Ped stepped out into Main Street and carefully walked around the back of the truck. Ped was struck by a motor vehicle negligently operated by Driver. If Ped asserts a claim against Trucker, the most likely result is that Ped will
1071	Defendant became intoxicated at a bar. He got into his car and drove away. Within a few blocks, craving another drink, he stopped ails car in the middle of the street, picked up a brick, and broke the display window of a liquor store. As he was reaching for a bottle, the night watchman arrived. Startled, Defendant turned, struck the watchman on the head with the bottle, killing him. Only vaguely aware of what was happening, Defendant returned to his car, consumed more liquor, and then drove off at a high speed. He ran a red light and struck and killed a pedestrian who was crossing the street. Relevant statutes define burglary to include "breaking and entering a building not used as a dwelling with the intent to commit a crime therein." Manslaughter is defined as the "killing of a human being in a criminally reckless manner." Criminal recklessness is "consciously disregarding a substantial and unjustifiable risk resulting from the actor's conduct." Murder is defined as "the premeditated and intentional killing of another or the killing of another in the commission of committing rape, robbery, burglary, or arson." Another statute provides that intoxication is not a defense to crime unless it negates an element of the offense. Defendant was charged with the murder of the watchman and manslaughter in the death of the pedestrian. Assume that he is tried separately on each charge. At Defendant's trial on the charge of manslaughter in the death of the pedestrian, his best argument would be that
1072	Karen was crossing Main Street at a crosswalk. John, who was on the sidewalk nearby, saw a speeding automobile heading in Karen's direction. John ran into the street and pushed Karen out of the path of the car. Karen fell to the ground and broke her leg. In an action for battery brought by Karen against John, will Karen prevail?
1073	Doe is prosecuted for giving his 14-year-old daughter a glass of wine in violation of a state statute prohibiting any person from serving any alcoholic beverage to a minor. Doe defends on the ground that the state statute as applied in his case unconstitutionally interferes with his free exercise of religion. In determining the constitutionality of this application of the state statute, the court may NOT properly
1074	Mom owned Blackacre, a two-family apartment house on a small city lot not suitable for partition-in-kind. Upon Mom's death, her will devised Blackacre to "my sons, Joe and John." A week ago, Ken obtained a money judgment against Joe, and properly filed the judgment in the county where Blackacre is located. A statute in the jurisdiction provides: any judgment properly filed shall, for ten years from filing, be a lien on the real property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person against whom the judgment is rendered. Joe needed cash, but John did not wish to sell Blackacre. Joe commenced a partition action against John and Ken. Assume that the court properly ordered a partition by judicial sale. After the sale, Ken's judgment will be a lien on
1075	A general contractor advertised in a trade publication that she planned to bid on the construction of a new building to be located in the town square. The advertisement welcomed bids from subcontractors to perform various functions, including plumbing. The lowest plumbing bid was from a local plumber who bid $10,000. The contractor used the bid in preparing her general bid. One hour after she submitted her general bid, the plumber called her and told her that he made a mistake on the bid he submitted to her, and that he could not do the plumbing work for less than $12,000. The contractor acknowledged that he had done good work for her in the past and said, "I'll just forget you ever made that $10,000 bid." The contractor then hired the second lowest bidder to do the plumbing work for $12,000. If the contractor sues the plumber for damages, will she prevail?
1076	The defendant pointed a loaded gun and shot at the victim. The bullet, however, missed the intended victim, but struck a bystander in the stomach. The bystander fully recovered. In a subsequent prosecution for attempted murder of both the victim and the bystander, the defendant testified that he had wanted only to scare the victim. Assuming that the jury believes this testimony, he may be convicted of attempted murder as to:
1077	Based on recommendations of a state commission studying the effect of pornographic films on violent criminal activity, a state adopted legislation banning films intended for commercial distribution that appealed as a whole to the prurient interest in sex of the average person in the community, portrayed sex in a patently offensive way to citizens of the state, and which a reasonable person in the United States would find had no serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. In ruling on a constitutional challenge to the legislation from a film distributor in the state who was convicted of distributing films in violation of the legislation, the federal court will likely find the legislation:
1078	Staff, Inc., a flour wholesaler, contracted to deliver to Eclaire, a producer of fine baked goods, her flour requirements for a one-year period. Before delivery of the first scheduled installment, Staff sold its business and "assigned" all of its sale contracts to Miller, Inc., another reputable and long-time flour wholesaler. Staff informed Eclaire of this transaction. For this question only, assume that when Miller tendered the first installment to Eclaire in compliance with the Staff-Eclaire contract, Eclaire refused to accept the goods. Which of the following arguments, if any, legally support(s) Eclaire's rejection of the goods? I. Executory requirements contracts are nonassignable. II. Duties under an executory bilateral contract are assumable only by an express promise to perform on the part of the delegatee. III. Language of "assignment" in the transfer for value of a bilateral sale-of-goods contract affects only a transfer of rights, not a delegation of duties.
1079	A manufacturer of high-speed computers entered into a written agreement with a distributor whereby the distributor would purchase a specified computer from the manufacturer for $50,000. The parties had orally agreed that the delivery date would be November 4. However, when the agreement was reduced to writing, a glitch in the word processor caused the printout to show the delivery date as "12/4" instead of "11/4." Both parties signed the paper without noticing the incorrect delivery date. Before reducing their agreement to writing, the parties had also orally agreed that the agreement would not become binding unless the distributor notified the manufacturer, in writing, by October 7, that it (the distributor) had obtained a buyer for the computer. On September 25, the distributor found a buyer who needed the computer for her business and who agreed to buy it from the distributor. However, the distributor did not inform the manufacturer that it had found a buyer until October 30. In the meantime, due to a strike at the manufacturer's leading competitor, the price of high-speed computers rose rapidly during the month of October. By the end of the month, the market value of the computer in question was $70,000. Because of the increase in the value of the computer, the manufacturer does not want to deliver the specified computer to the distributor for $50,000. Which of the following provides the best argument that the manufacturer should be discharged from its duties under the contract?
1080	Baker, the seller, authorized Ruiz in writing to sign a contract for the sale and purchase of land for her. Arthur, the buyer, orally authorized Thomas to sign the contract for him. Ruiz and Thomas signed the contract: "Baker by Ruiz, her agent" and "Arthur by Thomas, his agent." Arthur refuses to complete the purchase. Baker sues Arthur who pleads the Statute of Frauds. Baker will
1081	A car dealer entered into a written agreement with a mechanic for the restoration of a classic car in exchange for $5,000. Among the specifications in the agreement was a provision that the mechanic was to use cream-colored leather on the seats. There was no provision in the agreement regarding assignment. The mechanic began the job, and then assigned his right to payment under the agreement to a bank. When the job was a little more than half completed, the dealer sold the car to a car collector. In a document separate from the bill of sale, the dealer assigned her right to the mechanic's labor and delegated her duty to pay under the contract to the car collector. The mechanic completed the job on time but used bisque-colored leather instead of cream. The bisque leather was virtually identical in appearance to the cream and is considered equivalent in value by classic car enthusiasts. On learning of the substitution, the car collector refused to pay the bank. If the bank files suit against the car dealer for payment, will the court find the car dealer liable to pay the bank?
1082	In a writing signed by both parties, Paul Plannah, a renowned architect, agreed for a fee of $25,000 to design and supervise construction of a new house for Phoebe Threedee, a famous sculptor, the fee to be paid upon completion of the house. Plannah and Threedee got along poorly, and, when the design plans were about two-thirds complete, they had a heated argument over the proper location of a marble staircase. Hoping to avoid such encounters, Plannah, without Threedee's knowledge, assigned to Donna Drafty, a newly licensed architect practicing solo, "all of my rights and duties under my design and constructionsupervision contract with Threedee." Drafty expressly promised Plannah to carry out the work to the best of Drafty's ability. For this question only, assume that Threedee allowed Drafty to proceed with the design work but that Drafty without legal excuse abandoned the project shortly after construction began. Which of the following legal conclusions are correct? I. Plannah is liable to Threedee for legal damages, if any, caused by Drafty's default. II. Drafty is liable to Threedee for legal damages, if any, caused by Drafty's default. III. Threedee is indebted to Drafty, on a divisible contract theory, for a prorated portion of the agreed $25,000 architect's fee promised to Plannah.
1083	Structo contracted with Bailey to construct for $500,000 a warehouse and an access driveway at highway level. Shortly after commencing work on the driveway, which required for the specified level some excavation and removal of surface material, Structo unexpectedly encountered a large mass of solid rock. For this question only, assume the following facts. Structo informed Bailey (accurately) that because of the rock the driveway as specified would cost at least $20,000 more than figured, and demanded for that reason a total contract price of $520,000. Since Bailey was expecting warehousing customers immediately after the agreed completion date, he signed a writing promising to pay the additional $20,000. Following timely completion of the warehouse and driveway, which conformed to the contract in all respects, Bailey refused to pay Structo more than $500,000. What is the maximum amount to which Structo is entitled?
1084	A father had made a legally binding promise to furnish his son and his fiance with a house on their wedding day, planned for June 10 of the following year. Pursuant to that promise, the father and a contractor-friend entered into a contract for the building of a home on a piece of undeveloped land that the father owned. The contractor began building the house but breached the contract by abandoning the house unfinished on March 1. The contractor was aware when the agreement was made of the purpose for which the father wanted the completed house. Which of the following, if true, would best support the father's claim for consequential damages on account of the house not being finished by June 10?
1085	A brother and a sister held real property as joint tenants. The sister was involved in an automobile accident and was sued by a motorist who had received serious bodily injuries. The jury ruled against the sister and assessed a large damages award that the sister was unable to pay in full. Therefore, the motorist went back into court and secured a statutory lien on the property. Shortly thereafter, the sister died. What are the respective interests of the brother and the motorist in the property?
1086	Company wanted to expand the size of the building it owned that housed Company's supermarket by adding space for a coffeehouse. Company's building was located in the center of five acres of land owned by Company and devoted wholly to parking for its supermarket customers. City officials refused to grant a required building permit for the coffeehouse addition unless Company established in its store a child care center that would take up space at least equal to the size of the proposed coffeehouse addition, which was to be 20% of the existing building. This action of City officials was authorized by provisions of the applicable zoning ordinance. In a suit filed in state court against appropriate officials of City, Company challenged this child care center requirement solely on constitutional grounds. The lower court upheld the requirement even though City officials presented no evidence and made no findings to justify it other than a general assertion that there was a shortage of child care facilities in City. Company appealed. The court hearing the appeal should hold that the requirement imposed by City on the issuance of this building permit is
1087	Radon is a harmful gas found in the soil of certain regions of the United States. A statute of the state of Magenta requires occupants of residences with basements susceptible to the intrusion of radon to have their residences tested for the presence of radon and to take specified remedial steps if the test indicates the presence of radon above specified levels. The statute also provides that the testing for radon may be done only by testers licensed by a state agency. According to the statute, a firm may be licensed to test for radon only if it meets specified rigorous standards relating to the accuracy of its testing. These standards may easily be achieved with current technology; but the technology required to meet them is 50% more expensive than the technology required to measure radon accumulations in a slightly less accurate manner. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) does not license radon testers. However, a federal statute authorizes the EPA to advise on the accuracy of various methods of radon testing and to provide to the general public a list of testers that use methods it believes to be reasonably accurate. WeTest, a recently established Magenta firm, uses a testing method that the EPA has stated is reasonably accurate. WeTest is also included by the EPA on the list of testers using methods of testing it believes to be reasonably accurate. WeTest applies for a Magenta radon testing license, but its application is denied because WeTest cannot demonstrate that the method of testing for radon it uses is sufficiently accurate to meet the rigorous Magenta statutory standards. WeTest sues appropriate Magenta officials in federal court claiming that Magenta may not constitutionally exclude WeTest from performing the required radon tests in Magenta. In this suit, the court will probably rule in favor of
1088	A salvage company offered for sale Confederate dollars that had been recovered when the company recently raised a shipwreck off the coast of South Carolina. A purchasing agent for a private west coast museum purchased the bills, but he had represented that he was buying them for himself in hopes of obtaining a lower price. After purchasing the bills, the agent carefully packaged them and had them shipped to his museum. While the bills were in transit, the museum burned to the ground and its owner decided that she would not rebuild because most of her collections had been destroyed. When the bills arrived after the fire, the owner opened the package only to discover that the bills were too brittle for shipping by this method-three bills had disintegratedin transit. Undaunted, the owner took the remaining nine bills and had them mounted behind a glass frame so she could display them in her study. While the bills were being framed, the owner read on the Internet that a large cache of similar bills had just been discovered, and the market price for such bills had just been cut in half. Frustrated but still undaunted, the owner hung the framed bills in her study. Unfortunately, the salt water had reacted with the pigments in the bills in such a way that shortly after they had been exposed to indirect sunlight, all of the color in the bills faded almost completely away. No other Confederate bills raised from the ocean before had similar reactions; these bills appear to have been printed using substandard dyes. Which of the following facts would give the museum owner the best basis for rescinding the contract with the salvage company?
1089	A parachute company marketed a new parachute with the warning that the parachute should be discarded after 150 jumps. The designer of the new parachute took several of the chutes to an independent laboratory for testing. The scientists concluded that there was a 1% failure rate on the chutes for jumps 100 through 150 due to a design defect. The designer did not report this problem to his superiors at the company. Several months later a skydiver used one of the chutes, which had been used 100 times previously. The chute failed, and the skydiver hurtled to the ground to his death. An investigation established that the designer knew of the design defect. If the parachute manufacturer is charged with manslaughter in a common law jurisdiction, the verdict should be:
1090	A homeowner was trimming his sidewalkbordering hedge when a wasp began attacking him. The homeowner attempted to hit the wasp. During one of his swats, the homeowner struck a jogger in the face. The jogger, reacting to the unexpected blow to his head, pulled out a knife and stabbed the homeowner, seriously injuring him. If the jogger is prosecuted for aggravated battery, he probably will be found:
1091	Leaseco owned Blackacre, a tract of 100 acres. Six years ago, Leaseco leased a one-acre parcel, Oneacre, located in the northeasterly corner of Blackacre, for a term of 30 years, to Eatco. Eatco intended to and did construct a fast-food restaurant on Oneacre. The lease provided that: 1. Eatco was to maintain Oneacre and improvements thereon, to maintain full insurance coverage on Oneacre, and to pay all taxes assessed against Oneacre. 2. Leaseco was to maintain the access roads and the parking lot areas platted on those portions of Blackacre that adjoined Oneacre and to permit the customers of Eatco to use them in common with the customers of the other commercial users of the remainder of Blackacre. 3. Eatco was to pay its share of the expenses for the off-site improvements according to a stated formula. Five years ago, Leaseco sold Oneacre to Jones, an investor; the conveyance was made subject to the lease to Eatco. However, Jones did not assume the obligations of the lease and Leaseco retained the remainder of Blackacre. Since that conveyance five years ago, Eatco has paid rent to Jones. Eatco refused to pay its formula share of the off-site improvement costs as provided in the lease. Leaseco brought an appropriate action against Eatco to recover such costs. The most likely outcome would be in favor of
1092	A grantor executed a deed conveying a tract of land to a private school "for the life of my wife, and then to my children, their heirs and assigns, in equal shares; provided, however, that the school shall use the premises for educational purposes only." The school then erected a temporary building on the land and conducted certain classes within the building for several years. Three years ago, a geological survey of the area revealed that there were valuable minerals beneath the surface of the land. The school granted a mining company the right to remove the minerals from a one-acre portion of the land upon the payment of a royalty. The mining company has conducted mining operations on the one-acre portion of the land while the school has continued to conduct classes in the temporary building located on the land. Although both the grantor and his wife are still alive, both of their children file suit against the school and the mining company seeking damages for the removal of minerals, an injunction to prevent further removal, and all other appropriate remedies. Which of the following would be the most likely result?
1093	A husband's and wife's Social Security retirement benefits came in a single check payable to both each month, two-thirds of which was the husband's retirement payment and one-third of which was the wife's spousal benefit. Each month when the check arrived in the mail, the wife would take it to their bank and cash it, receiving the entire proceeds in cash, which she would use for her and her husband's living expenses. After the husband died, the Social Security check continued to come in the same amount and made payable to both the husband and wife. The wife knew that she was no longer entitled to her husband's benefit, but that her own spousal benefit would increase greatly as a widow's benefit. She also knew that she would receive a one-time "death benefit." She concluded that the continued receipt of the combined check reflected these increases, so for several months after her husband's death she continued to cash the combined check, signing both her and her husband's names when she negotiated it. When the federal government eventually processed the notification of the husband's death provided by the funeral home, it discovered that the wife had negotiated checks containing $2,000 in benefits to which she was not entitled. Is she guilty of obtaining the payments by false pretenses?
1094	Late one night two brothers took the older brother's new all-terrain vehicle for an off-road test drive on some trails at a county park, even though a county ordinance prohibited vehicle traffic on any of the trails, limiting their use to hikers, bike riders, and horse riders. While on a trail, the vehicle's tires slipped and the vehicle fell down a steep incline. As it fell, it turned over several times, but landed on its tires when it reached the bottom of the incline. However, the vehicle's roll bar, which was intended to protect passengers in the event the vehicle turned over, collapsed due to some cracks in the welded area of the brace. The older brother was killed in the accident, and the younger brother suffered severe head and back injuries. The younger brother brought a negligence action against the vehicle's manufacturer. The manufacturer cited as a defense the violation of the county ordinance by the older brother. Depending on the jurisdiction's contributory negligence rule, this violation of the ordinance will:
1095	Clerk is a clerical worker who has been employed for the past two years in a permanent position in the Wasmania County Public Records Office in the state of Orange. Clerk has been responsible for copying and filing records of real estate transactions in that office. Clerk works in a nonpublic part of the office and has no contact with members of the public. However, state law provides that all real estate records in that office are to be made available for public inspection. On the day an attempted assassination of the governor of Orange was reported on the radio, Clerk remarked to a coworker, "Our governor is such an evil man, I am sorry they did not get him." Clerk's coworker reported this remark to Clerk's employer, the county recorder. After Clerk admitted making the remark, the county recorder dismissed him stating that "there is no room in this office for a person who hates the governor so much." Clerk sued for reinstatement and back pay. His only claim is that the dismissal violated his constitutional rights. In this case, the court should hold that the county recorder's dismissal of Clerk was
1096	A 10-lot subdivision was approved by the proper governmental authority. The authority's action was pursuant to a map filed by the developer, which included an undesignated parcel in addition to the 10 numbered lots. The shape of the undesignated parcel is different and somewhat larger than any one of the numbered lots. Subdivision building restrictions were imposed on "all the lots shown on said map." The developer contracts to sell the undesignated parcel, described by metes and bounds, to an investor. Is title to the parcel marketable?
1097	On February 1, a national department store chain entered into a written agreement with a canoe manufacturer providing that the manufacturer would sell the department store any quantity of 16-foot aluminum canoes that the department store desired at a price of $250 per canoe, deliveries to be made 30 days after any order. The agreement was signed by authorized agents of both parties. On March 1, the department store sent the manufacturer an order for 500 canoes to be delivered in 30 days. The manufacturer immediately e-mailed the department store a confirmation of the order. Ten days later, the department store sent the manufacturer an order for an additional 500 canoes, to be delivered in 30 days. Five days after receiving the department store's second order, the manufacturer e-mailed the department store and explained that a large sporting goods chain was willing to purchase all of the manufacturer's output of 16-foot canoes at $275 per canoe and that the manufacturer would be unable to fill any of the department store's orders. The department store found another canoe manufacturer willing to provide it with 16-foot aluminum canoes for $280 per canoe and on April 15 filed an action against the manufacturer seeking damages for the manufacturer's failure to deliver the 1,000 canoes ordered. How should the court rule?
1098	Osif owned Broadacres in fee simple. For a consideration of $5,000, Osif gave Bard a written option to purchase Broadacres for $300,000. The option was assignable. For a consideration of $10,000, Bard subsequently gave an option to Cutter to purchase Broadacres for $325,000. Cutter exercised his option. Bard thereupon exercised his option. Bard paid the agreed price of $300,00 and took title to Broadacres by deed from Osif. Thereafter, Cutter refused to consummate his purchase. Bard brought an appropriate action against Cutter for specific performance, or, if that should be denied, then for damages. Cutter counterclaimed for return of the $10,000. In this action, the court will
1099	On October 1, Toy Store, Inc., entered into a written contract with Fido Factory, Inc., for the purchase at $20 per unit of 1,000 mechanical dogs, to be specially manufactured by Fido according to Toy Store's specifications. Fido promised to deliver all of the dogs "not later than November 15, for the Yule shopping season," and Toy Store promised to pay the full $20,000 price upon delivery. In order to obtain operating funds, Fido as borrower entered into a written loan agreement on October 5 with the High Finance Company. In relevant part, this agreement recited, "Fido Factory hereby transfers and assigns to High Finance its (Fido Factory's) October 1 mechanical dog contract with Toy Store, as security for a 50-day loan of $15,000, the advance and receipt of which are hereby acknowledged by Fido Factory." No copy of this agreement, or statement relating to it, was filed in an office of public record. On October 15, Fido notified Toy Store, "We regret to advise that our master shaft burned out last night because our night supervisor let the lubricant level get too low. We have just fired the supervisor, but the shaft cannot be repaired or replaced until about January 1. We can guarantee delivery of your order, however, not later than January 20." Toy Store rejected this proposal as unacceptable and immediately contracted with the only other available manufacturer to obtain the 1,000 dogs at $30 per unit by November 15. For this question only, assume that on November 1, Toy Store sues Fido for damages and alleges the above facts, except those relating to the Fido-High Finance loan agreement. Upon Fido's motion to dismiss the complaint, the court should
1100	Because of budget shortfalls, a state governor recently signed a bill shortening the period for which state unemployment benefits are available. The defendant gave a speech across the street from the governor's mansion, denouncing the law. In his speech, the defendant urged the crowd to rush across the street, drag the governor from his mansion, and show him how it feels to be homeless. A police officer who heard the defendant's speech arrested the defendant and he was charged with violating a state statute that makes it a crime to "make a threat against any state official in the performance of his duty." If the defendant defends on constitutional grounds, the court will likely find the statute:
1101	In a tort action, Fisher testified against Dawes. Dawes then called Jones, who testified that Fisher had a bad reputation for veracity. Dawes then also called Weld to testify that Fisher once perpetrated a hoax on the police. Weld's testimony is
1102	While cross-examining a defendant on trial for robbery and assault with a deadly weapon, the prosecutor asks him whether he was convicted of fraud within the previous year. This question is:
1103	To secure a loan of $100,000 from a bank, the owner in fee simple of a parcel of land conveyed a deed of trust for the land to the bank. The deed of trust contained a "power of sale" clause, permitted by the jurisdiction, which allowed the bank to sell the property in the event of default without the necessity of a judicial foreclosure action. After several years, the owner defaulted on his loan payments to the bank. The bank informed the owner that it was exercising its power of sale. After appropriate notices, the bank conducted a public sale of the land. The bank was the sole bidder and obtained the property for $80,000, which was $10,000 less than the outstanding balance on the loan plus the expenses of the sale. One month later, the owner notified the bank that he wanted to pay off the loan and extinguish the deed of trust, and was prepared to tender $80,000 to do so. The bank insisted that the owner must tender $90,000 to pay off the loan. If a court in the jurisdiction will require the bank to accept only $80,000 under the circumstances above, it will be because:
1104	An antiques purchaser who did not speak English sued a dealer for breach of contract, alleging that he had agreed to sell her an antique chair for $15,000 but had refused to accept her certified check when she came to pick up the chair. At the trial, the purchaser, through an interpreter, testified that she asked her brother to communicate to the dealer her offer to purchase the chair. She wishes to testify that her brother told her, "The dealer has agreed to sell you the chair for $15,000." The agreement was not reduced to writing and the brother died a few days after that conversation. If the jurisdiction has a typical "Dead Man Act," what effect will the Act have upon the admissibility of the purchaser's conversation with her brother?
1105	At the defendant's trial for arson, the prosecution seeks to impeach the defendant through a record of the defendant's conviction of a misdemeanor robbery five years ago. The defendant objects. Should the court admit this evidence over the defendant's objection?
1106	Under the terms of a written contract, Karp agreed to construct for Manor a garage for $10,000. Nothing was said in the parties' negotiations or in the contract about progress payments during the course of the work. For this question only, assume the following facts. After completing 25% of the garage strictly according to Manor's specifications, Karp demanded payment of $2,000 as a "reasonable progress payment." Manor refused, and Karp abandoned the job. If each party sues the other for breach of contract, which of the following will the court decide?
1107	An officer went to an apartment to execute a properly obtained search warrant during an investigation of an operation making counterfeit watches. When he arrived he shouted, "Police, open up," but he did not wait before entering the apartment through the unlocked front door. The officer found the defendant half-asleep in a back room, with a workbench for assembling counterfeit watches nearby. Along with some completed counterfeit watches, the officer found a toolset used for making watches and receipts for various watch components in a drawer of the workbench, all of which the officer seized as evidence. The defendant was charged with illegal counterfeiting. Prior to trial, his attorney moves to suppress the evidence obtained during the search. Should the court grant his motion?
1108	A state statute provided that only residents of the state can be granted a license to practice medicine within the state. The statute was passed after a series of well-publicized mistakes by a nonresident physician led to a public consensus that nonresidents were less likely to be familiar with the medical standards followed in the state, making them more likely to commit malpractice. A respected surgeon who lived and was licensed in a neighboring state was offered and accepted the position of chief surgeon at a hospital in the state with the residency statute. Because he lived only 20 minutes away from the hospital, he did not wish to move. He filed an action in federal court challenging the residency requirement, alleging that the statute discriminated against nonresidents in violation of the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV. The federal court is likely to find that the statute is:
1109	A buyer agreed to purchase a portion of a seller's parcel for $25,000. The buyer and the seller orally agreed that the property included in the purchase would be the westerly third of the parcel, and the eastern boundary would be a stone fence that ran from the northern border of the parcel to the southern boundary. Due to a clerical error by the seller's secretary, when the agreement was reduced to writing, the eastern boundary was stated to be the picket fence, which is 275 yards east of the stone fence. If the buyer sues for specific performance of the contract conveying the additional strip of land, the buyer will likely:
1110	The police, answering a complaint about noise, arrived at Sam's apartment and found Sam's wife dead on the living room floor. One of the officers turned to Sam and said, "What happened?" Sam replied, "She was a bitch and I took care of her." At Sam's trial his statement should be ruled
1111	Donald was arrested in Marilyn's apartment after her neighbors had reported sounds of a struggle and the police had arrived to find Donald bent over Marilyn's prostrate body. Marilyn was rushed to the hospital where she lapsed into a coma. Despite the explanation that he was trying to revive Marilyn after she suddenly collapsed, Donald was charged with attempted rape and assault after a neighbor informed the police that she had heard Marilyn sobbing, "No, please no, let me alone." At trial, the forensic evidence was inconclusive. The jury acquitted Donald of attempted rape but convicted him of assault. While he was serving his sentence for assault, Marilyn, who had never recovered from the coma, died. Donald was then indicted and tried on a charge of felony murder. In this common-law jurisdiction, there is no statute that prevents a prosecutor from proceeding in this manner, but Donald argued that a second trial for felony murder after his original trial for attempted rape and assault would violate the double jeopardy clause. His claim is
1112	A landowner owned two adjoining parcels of land containing a number of lakes. She conveyed the eastern parcel, which contained a campground, to a fisherman. The deed transferring the parcel granted to the fisherman "and to invited guests of the campground all hunting and fishing rights and use of the lakes on the western parcel for the benefit of the campground." Subsequently, the fisherman assigned his hunting and fishing rights to a hunter. When the landowner discovered the hunter hunting and fishing on her land, she brought an appropriate action to declare his rights void. If the court rules for the landowner, it will be because the fisherman's right to hunt and fish on the western parcel is:
1113	An impatient driver who was fed up with jaywalking pedestrians drove straight at one of them, leaning on the horn and intending to make her jump. She did not hear him or change her pace, however, because her music player was turned to full volume. A bystander on the curb rushed out to pull her to safety. She tripped as she was being pulled to the curb, fracturing her kneecap. If the pedestrian sues the driver for assault, the likely result will be:
1114	Motorco is a manufacturer of motor vehicles. A federal regulation requires that all motor vehicles manufactured for sale in the United States be equipped with seat belts for each passenger and prescribes specifications for such belts. Motorco equipped all its cars with seat belts. It purchased all the bolts used in its seat belt assemblies from Boltco and it tested samples from each shipment received. Dunn purchased a motor vehicle manufactured by Motorco. While operating the car, with Price as a passenger in the front seat, Dunn collided with another vehicle. The collision was due solely to Dunn's negligence. Price had his seat belt fastened, but one of the bolts which anchored the belt to the frame broke. Price was thrown through the windshield, sustaining various injuries. Dunn, whose belt was fastened and held, was killed when, following the collision, the car went off the road, down an embankment, and overturned. Subsequent to the accident, tests of the bolt that broke showed metallurgical defects. Motorco's records showed that tests of samples from the shipment in which the defective bolt was received revealed no defective bolts. In an action based on strict liability in tort by Price against Boltco, Price will rely principally on
1115	At the time of his death last week, Test owned Blackacre, a small farm. By his duly probated will, drawn five years ago, Test did the following: (1) devised Blackacre "to Arthur for the life of Baker, then to Casper"; (2) gave "all the rest, residue and remainder of my Estate, both real and personal, to my friend Fanny." At his death, Test was survived by Arthur, Casper, Sonny (Test's son and sole heir), and Fanny. Baker had died a week before Test. Title to Blackacre is now inx
1116	BCD, a manufacturer of computers, pays its salespeople a salary of $1,000 per month and a commission of 5% on billings actually rendered for machines that they sell. BCD salespeople are employed at will under written agreements which provide that in order to receive a commission the salesperson must be in the employment of the company when the bill is sent to the customer. In 1976, John, a salesperson for BCD, worked for eight months to get an order from Bobb Corporation for a large $750,000 computer. He consulted extensively with Bobb's top executives and worked with its operating personnel to dt.velop detailed specifications for the new equipment. He also promised Bobb, with BCD's knowledge and approval, to assist Bobb for six months after installation in making the equipment work. On January 1, 1977, Bobb signed an order, and on March 1 the computer was installed. On March 15, BCD fired John on the stated ground that he had failed to meet his 1975 and 1976 sales quotas. John thought that BCD was correct in this statement. Another salesperson, Franklin, was thereupon assigned to service the Bobb account. On March 31, BCD billed Bobb for the computer. Assume for this question only that BCD's termination of John's employment was not wrongful. If John, after demand and refusal, sues BCD for the Bobb sale commission, which of the following is the most likely result?
1117	Smythe was charged with the murder of his wife. In his defense, he testified that at the time he killed her he believed that his wife was planning to destroy the world by detonating a massive explosive device that she had developed and built in the basement of their home. He further testified that he had tried many times to dissuade his wife from her plan and had tried to destroy devices that she stored in the basement. She had, he testified, foiled his efforts by on two occasions signing papers for his hospitalization, which lasted for a brief period each time. He said that he had concluded that the only way to prevent her scheme was to kill her and that he had become so obsessed with the importance of doing so that he could think of nothing else. One day when he saw her open the door to the basement he lunged at her and pushed her down the steps to her death. The best defense raised by Smythe's testimony is
1118	A father executed a will, devising his land "to my son and my daughter, share and share alike." The following year, the son died intestate, leaving a child as his only heir. Subsequently, the father and the daughter were involved in a plane crash. The father died immediately. The daughter died the following week, leaving a will that bequeathed her entire estate to her husband. The jurisdiction has the following statute: "A bequest to a descendant of the testator who predeceases the testator passes instead to the predeceasing beneficiary's surviving descendants." Who owns the land?
1119	Ohner holds title in fee simple to a tract of 1,500 acres. He desires to develop the entire tract as golf course, country club, and residential subdivision. He contemplates forming a corporation to own and to operate the golf course and country club: the stock in the corporation will be distributed to the owners of lots in the residential portions of the subdivision, but no obligation to issue the stock is to ripen until all the residential lots are sold. The price of the lots is intended to return enough money to compensate Ohner for the raw land, development costs (including the building of the golf course and the country club facilities), and developer's profit, if all of the lots are sold. Ohner's market analyses indicate that he must create a scheme of development that will offer prospective purchasers (and their lawyers) a very high order of assurance that several aspects will be clearly established: 1. Aside from the country club and golf course, there will be no land user other than for residential use and occupancy in the 1,500 acres. 2. The residents of the subdivision will have unambiguous right of access to the club and golf course facilities. 3. Each lot owner must have an unambiguous right to transfer his lot to a purchaser with all original benefits. 4. Each lot owner must be obligated to pay annual dues equal to a pro rata share (based on the number of lots) of the club's annual operating deficit (whether or not such owner desires to make use of club and course facilities). Of the following, the greatest difficulty that will be encountered in establishing the scheme is that
1120	House owns his home in City. On the lawn in front of his home and within five feet of the public sidewalk, there was a large tree. The roots of the tree caused the sidewalk to buckle severely and become dangerous. An ordinance of City requires adjacent landowners to keep sidewalks in safe condition. House engaged Contractor to repair the sidewalk, leaving it to Contractor to decide how the repair should be made. Contractor dug up the sidewalk, cut back the roots of the tree, and laid a new sidewalk. Two days after House had paid Contractor the agreed price of the repair, the tree fell over onto the street and damaged a parked car belonging to Driver. Driver has asserted claims against House and Contractor, and both defendants admit that cutting the roots caused the tree to fall. The theory on which Driver is most likely to prevail against House is that House is
1121	Opus, the owner of Stoneacre, entered into a written agreement with Miner. Under this written agreement, which was acknowledged and duly recorded, Miner, for a five-year period, was given the privilege to enter on Stoneacre to remove sand, gravel, and stone in whatever quantities Miner desired. Miner was to make monthly payments to Opus on the basis of the amount of sand, gravel, and stone removed during the previous month. Under the terms of the agreement, Miner's privilege was exclusive against all others except Opus, who reserved the right to use Stoneacre to any purpose whatsoever, including the removal of sand, gravel, and stone. One year after the agreement was entered into, the state brought a condemnation action to take Stoneacre for a highway interchange. In the condemnation action, is Miner entitled to compensation?
1122	An automotive engineer announced that he had developed a carburetor that will enable cars to achieve 100 miles per gallon of fuel, and that he will allow the carburetor to be inspected next month. Soon after, a former employer of the engineer brought an action to prohibit the engineer from displaying the carburetor, claiming that the engineer probably had stolen the carburetor's design from the employer. The court granted the employer a temporary restraining order prohibiting the engineer from disclosing any mechanical details of his carburetor, and ordered a hearing to be held in one week to determine whether a preliminary injunction should be issued. Because each party would have to reveal the mechanical details of his designs at the hearing, the employer requested that the hearing be closed to the public and that the record be sealed to avoid revelation of his designs. The court granted the request. A reporter for a monthly automobile magazine heard about the case and wanted to attend the hearing. When he was told that the hearing would be closed, he filed an action to have it opened. What is the reporter's best argument for opening the hearing?
1123	A defendant is charged with larceny. His principal defense was that he had no intent to permanently deprive the victim of her property. The judge instructs the jury that the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty of larceny and that the evidence tended to show that the defendant had taken some jewels belonging to the victim; but if they believed that the defendant had proven by a fair preponderance of the evidence that he did not intend to keep the jewels, but to return them, they should find him not guilty. The defendant was convicted of larceny. He appeals the conviction, contending that the judge erred in his instructions to the jury. The defendant's conviction will probably be:
1124	At Defendant's murder trial, Defendant calls Witness as his first witness to testify that Defendant has a reputation in their community as a peaceable and truthful person. The prosecutor objects on the ground that Witness's testimony would constitute improper character evidence. The court should
1125	Albert, the owner of a house and lot, leased the same to Barnes for a term of five years. In addition to the house, there was also an unattached, two-car brick garage located on the lot. Barnes earned his living as an employee in a local grocery store, but his hobby consisted of wood carving and the making of small furniture. Barnes installed a work bench, electric lights, and a radiator in the garage. He also laid pipes connecting the radiator with the heating plant inside the house. Thereafter Albert mortgaged the premises to Good Bank to secure a loan. Barnes was not given notice of the mortgage, but the mortgage was recorded. Still later, Albert defaulted on his mortgage payments, and Good Bank began foreclosure proceedings, as it was entitled to do under the terms of the mortgage. By this time Barnes's lease was almost ended. Barnes began the removal of the equipment he had installed in the garage. Good Bank brought an action to enjoin the removal of the equipment mentioned above. Both Barnes and Albert were named as defendants. If the court refuses the injunction, it will be because
1126	Two adjacent, two-story, commercial buildings were owned by Simon. The first floors of both buildings were occupied by various retail establishments. The second floors were rented to various other tenants. Access to the second floor of each building was reached by a common stairway located entirely in Building 1. While the buildings were being used in this manner, Simon sold Building 1 to Edward by warranty deed which made no mention of any rights concerning the stairway. About two years later Simon sold Building 2 to Dennis. The stairway continued to be used by the occupants of both buildings. The stairway became unsafe as a consequence of regular wear and tear. Dennis entered upon Edward's building and began the work of repairing the stairway. Edward demanded that Dennis discontinue the repair work and vacate Edward's building. When Dennis refused, Edward brought an action to enjoin Dennis from continuing the work. Judgment should be for
1127	A defendant was convicted of burglary after the prosecution established at a jury trial that the defendant broke into the victim's house at night by cutting open a window screen and climbing into a bedroom. The evidence also established that the defendant was frightened into leaping out the window when the victim pulled a gun from beneath her pillow. The defendant testified in his own defense, stating that he entered the house merely to use the telephone. His lawyer thus argued that the defendant lacked the required intent for burglary. The trial court, after instructing the jury on the elements of burglary, said, "If you find that by a fair preponderance of the evidence the defendant has shown that he intended to use the telephone when he entered the victim's home, then you must find him not guilty." If the defendant appeals his conviction, will he likely obtain a reversal?
1128	The plaintiff sued the defendant for injuries suffered when her car collided in an intersection with one driven by the defendant. At trial, the plaintiff testified that she had had the rightof-way over the defendant to enter the intersection. The defendant did not cross-examine her. The plaintiff then called a witness to testify that, shortly after the collision, as she pulled the plaintiff from the car, the witness heard the plaintiff say, "I think I'm dying! Didn't the other driver see I had the right-of-way?" The witness's testimony was admitted over defense counsel's objections. On appeal from a verdict for the plaintiff, the defendant challenges the admission of the witness's testimony. Should the trial court's ruling be upheld?
1129	A federal statute provided for federal grants to cities that desired to rebuild inner-city areas for residential housing. A city applied for funding to build housing and received a grant of $2.5 million. After the area was prepared for construction, however, the city council decided that it would greatly benefit the inner-city dwellers if, in addition to housing, commercial property were built. Thus, the council decided to use $1.5 million for housing and to "borrow" the remaining $1 million from the housing fund to build a commercial mall. The city resolution provided that 30% of the rental from the mall each year would go to a fund for maintenance of the housing and for funds to build additional housing. Construction had started on residential buildings and the commercial mall when the federal court, at the request of the federal government, froze the construction accounts containing the proceeds from the grant. In a motion by the city to release the funds, the court would most likely:
1130	Staff, Inc., a flour wholesaler, contracted to deliver to Eclaire, a producer of fine baked goods, her flour requirements for a one-year period. Before delivery of the first scheduled installment, Staff sold its business and "assigned" all of its sale contracts to Miller, Inc., another reputable and long-time flour wholesaler. Staff informed Eclaire of this transaction. For this question only, assume that Eclaire accepted Miller's delivery of the first installment under the Staff-Eclaire contract, but that Eclaire paid the contract price for that installment to Staff and refused to pay anything to Miller. In an action by Miller against Eclaire for the contractual amount of the first installment, which of the following, if any, will be an effective defense for Eclaire? I. Eclaire had not expressly agreed to accept Miller as her flour supplier. II. Eclaire's payment of the contractual installment to Staff discharged her obligation. III. Staff remained obligated to Eclaire even though Staff had assigned the contract to Miller.
1131	The owner of Newacre executed and delivered to a power company a right-of-way deed for the building and maintenance of an overhead power line across Newacre. The deed was properly recorded. Newacre then passed through several intermediate conveyances until it was conveyed to Sloan about ten years after the date of the right-of-way deed. All the intermediate deeds were properly recorded, but none of them mentioned the right-of-way. Sloan entered into a written contract to sell Newacre to Jones. By the terms of the contract, Sloan promised to furnish an abstract of title to Jones. Sloan contracted directly with Abstract Company to prepare and deliver an abstract to Jones, and Abstract Company did so. The abstract omitted the right-of-way deed. Jones delivered the abstract to his attorney and asked the attorney for an opinion as to title. The attorney signed and delivered to Jones a letter stating that, from the attorney's examination of the abstract, it was his "opinion that Sloan had a free and unencumbered marketable title to Newacre." Sloan conveyed Newacre to Jones by a deed which included covenants of general warranty and against encumbrances. Jones paid the full purchase price. After Jones had been in possession of Newacre for more than a year, he learned about the right-of-way deed. Sloan, Jones, Abstract Company. and Jones's attorney were all without actual knowledge of the existence of the right-of-way prior to the conveyance from Sloan to Jones. If Jones sues Sloan because of the presence of the right-of-way, the most likely result will be a decision for
1132	Testator devised his farm "to my son, Selden, for life, then to Selden's children and their heirs and assigns." Selden, a widower, had two unmarried, adult children. In appropriate action to construe the will, the court will determine that the remainder to children is
1133	Gasco owns a storage facility where flammable gases are stored in liquefied form under high pressure in large spherical tanks. The facility was constructed for Gasco by Acme Company, a firm that specializes in the construction of such facilities. After the facility had been in use for five years, an explosion in the facility started a large fire that blanketed the surrounding countryside with a high concentration of oily smoke and soot. Farber owns a large truck farm near the facility. His entire lettuce crop was destroyed by oily deposits left by the smoke. Johnson, who lives near the facility, inhaled a large amount of the smoke and thereafter became obsessed by a fear that the inhalation would destroy his health and ultimately cause his death. If Farber asserts a claim against Gasco for the los of his lettuce crop and-is unable to show any negligence on the part of Gasco, will Farber prevail?
1134	Pitt sued Dill for damages for back injuries received in a car wreck. Dill disputed the damages and sought to prove that Pitt's disability, if any, resulted from a childhood horseback riding accident. Pitt admitted the childhood accident, but contended it had no lasting effect. Pitt calls Dr. Webb, an orthopedist who had never examined Pitt, and poses to Webb a hypothetical question as to the cause of the disability that omits any reference to the horseback riding accident. The question was not provided to opposing counsel before trial. The best ground for objecting to this question would be that
1135	Alice owned a commercial property, Eastgate, consisting of a one-story building rented to various retail stores and a very large parking lot. Two years ago, Alice died and left Eastgate to her nephew, Paul, for life, with remainder to her godson, Richard, his heirs and assigns. Paul was 30 years old and Richard was 20 years old when Alice died. The devise of Eastgate was made subject to any mortgage on Eastgate in effect at the time of Alice's death. When Alice executed her will, the balance of the mortgage debt on Eastgate was less than $5,000. A year before her death, Alice suffered financial reverses; and in order to meet her debts, she had mortgaged Eastgate to secure a loan of $150,000. The entire principal of the mortgage remained outstanding when she died. As a result, the net annual income from Eastgate was reduced not only by real estate taxes and regular maintenance costs, but also by the substantial mortgage interest payments that were due each month. Paul was very dissatisfied with the limited benefit that he was receiving from the life estate. When, earlier this year, Acme, Inc., proposed to purchase Eastgate, demolish the building, pay off the mortgage, and construct a 30-story office building, Paul was willing to accept Acme's offer. However, Richard adamantly refused the offer, even though Richard, as the remainderman, paid the principal portion of each monthly mortgage amortization payment. Richard was independently wealthy and wanted to convert Eastgate into a public park when he became entitled to possession. When Acme realized that Richard would not change his mind, Acme modified its proposal to a purchase of the life estate of Paul. Acme was ready to go ahead with its building plans, relying upon a large life insurance policy on Paul's life to protect it against the economic risk of Paul's death. Paul's life expectancy was 45 years. When Richard learned that Paul had agreed to Acme's modified proposal, Richard brought an appropriate action against them to enjoin their carrying it out. There is no applicable statute. The best argument for Richard is that
1136	At the defendant's trial for murder, facts were introduced that the defendant acted in the heat of passion. After a lengthy trial, the defendant was convicted of manslaughter. On appeal, the conviction was reversed on procedural grounds. The state immediately moved to retry the defendant, again bringing murder charges against her. The defendant moved to strike the murder charge, and the court refused to grant the motion. After the second trial, the defendant was again convicted of the lesser charge of manslaughter. The defendant appeals the second conviction, claiming that it violated her constitutional rights. May the second conviction stand?
1137	A landowner owned a tract of land, and his brother owned the adjoining property. The landowner drew up an instrument that stated: Upon my death, I wish the land to pass to my wife; but should she or her heirs ever attempt to sell the land, the right of first refusal is hereby granted to my brother, his heirs and assigns. The brother drew up a similar instrument granting the landowner the same rights over the adjoining property. Both instruments were executed with all proper formalities. The landowner died, and the wife enjoyed possession of the land. Subsequently, she offered to sell the land to a buyer for $200,000. The brother learned of this and demanded that he be allowed to exercise his option to purchase the land. The wife refused. The brother filed suit to compel the wife to sell him the land. Assuming that the state in which the property is located strictly follows the common law Rule Against Perpetuities and the common law rule against restraints on alienation, will the brother prevail?
1138	The defendant was arrested and charged with the battery of a co-worker. At trial, the defendant testified that he struck the co-worker only in self-defense because the co-worker had threatened to kill him. The defendant further testified without objection that he had told the arresting officer that he had acted in self-defense. In rebuttal, the prosecutor called the officer to testify that the defendant made no such statement to him. The officer's testimony is:
1139	In early July, the owner of a toy store entered into a contract with a craftsman for the purchase of 25 hand-carved wooden rocking horses for the holiday sales season. The agreement failed to state a delivery date for the horses. After several months went by without any word from the craftsman, the owner forgot about the agreement. On October 15, the owner ordered a quantity of mass-produced resin-based rocking horses to sell in his store for the upcoming holiday season. One week later, the craftsman arrived at the toy store with a truck carrying the horses and demanded payment, but the toy store owner refused, stating that he already had more than enough rocking horses to sell. The craftsman sued the owner for breach of contract. May the craftsman enforce the contract?
1140	On July 18, Snowco, a shovel manufacturer, received an order for the purchase of 500 snow shovels from Acme, Inc., a wholesaler. Acme had mailed the purchase order on July 15. The order required shipment of the shovels no earlier than September 15 and no later than October 15. Typed conspicuously across the front of the order form was the following: "Acme, Inc., reserves the right to cancel this order at any time before September 1." Snowco's mailed response, saying "We accept your order," was received by Acme on July 21. As of July 22, which of the following is an accurate statement as to whether a contract was formed?
1141	After a business lunch at a restaurant, a patron went to the restaurant's cloakroom to get his coat. He removed a coat he believed to be his own from the coat rack. The coat was of similar color and of the same brand as the patron's own coat, but it actually belonged to another customer. The patron walked back to his office and removed the coat. As he was hanging it up, he noticed that another person's name was written on the inside of the collar. He immediately left the office and sprinted back in the direction of the restaurant, intending to return the coat and pick up his own. As he crossed the street, the patron was struck by a car. Although his injuries were minor, the coat was destroyed. If the patron is acquitted of larceny, what is the best reason for his acquittal?
1142	During the night, Murphy broke into a house with the intention of stealing a typewriter. On not finding a typewriter, she became angry, poured lighter fluid onto a couch, and set it on fire. The flames destroyed the couch and also burned a portion of the ceiling in the room. In a common-law jurisdiction, Murphy is guilty of
1143	A defendant going to trial for the felony of aggravated battery filed a motion to have the court seat a jury with only five members. He stated that five was his lucky number and that he would be willing to sign any release to ensure a jury of five. Should the judge grant the defendant's motion to impanel a jury of five members?
1144	The plaintiff brought suit against the defendant for injuries sustained when she was struck by the defendant's car while crossing the street. The defendant denied liability, claiming that the plaintiff crossed against the light. To establish liability, the plaintiff offers into evidence the hospital record from her visit to the emergency room, in which she stated that the defendant failed to come to a complete stop at a red light when the plaintiff entered the crosswalk. The physician who made the entry still works at the hospital but has not been called to testify. If the defendant objects to the evidence, the court should rule that it is:
1145	Until 1954, the state of New Atlantic required segregation in all public and private schools, but all public schools are now desegregated. Other state laws, enacted before 1954 and continuing to the present, provide for free distribution of the same textbooks on secular subjects to students in all public and private schools. In addition, the state accredits schools and certifies teachers. Little White School House, a private school that offers elementary and secondary education in the state, denies admission to all non-Caucasians. Stone School is a private school that offers religious instruction. Which of the following is the strongest argument against the constitutionality of free distribution of textbooks to the students at the Little White School House?
1146	While a driver was driving someone else's car, he hit a plaintiff who was walking in a pedestrian right-of-way. The plaintiff sued both the driver and the owner of the car, alleging that the driver had negligently driven the car and that the owner had negligently permitted an unfit driver to use her car. At trial, the plaintiff calls his first witness. The witness testifies that within the last several months he is aware of three instances in which the driver has engaged in reckless driving. Both the driver and the owner object to the admission of this evidence. The objection should be:
1147	A defendant is arrested and tried for battery. At trial, the prosecution offers evidence showing that the defendant lightly punched the victim in the stomach. The victim was not injured in any way. The defendant claims that he was suffering from a seizure and had no control over his actions. If the jury believes him, should he be convicted of battery?
1148	On March I, Green and Brown orally agreed that Brown would erect a boathouse on Green's lot and dig a channel from the boathouse, across Clark's lot, to a lake. Clark had already orally agreed with Green to permit the digging of the channel across Clark's lot. Brown agreed to begin work on the boathouse on March 15, and to complete all the work before June 1. The total price of $10,000 was to be paid by Green in three installments: $2,500 on March 15; $2,500 when the boathouse was completed; $5,000 when Brown finished the digging of the channel. Assume that Green paid the $2,500 on March 15, that Brown completed the boathouse, that Green paid the second installment of $2,500, and that Brown completed the digging of the channel but not until July 1. Assume further that the absence of a writing is not raised as a defense. Which of the following is (are) correct? I. Green has a cause of action against Brown for breach of contract. II. Green is excused from paying the $5,000.
1149	A teacher brought a battery action against a student. At trial, the evidence established that the teacher was kicked by the student in the leg. What additional fact established at trial will likely prevent the teacher from recovering for battery?
1150	A woman purported to convey a vacant parcel of land she did not own to a buyer by a general warranty deed. The buyer immediately recorded the deed, built a house on the land, and has resided there ever since. Six months later, the woman acquired title to the parcel of land from the true owner. The woman immediately sold the land to an investor by a general warranty deed, which the investor promptly recorded. The investor paid the woman a reasonable value for the parcel of land. Because the investor purchased the parcel of land solely as an investment and never visited it, she never knew that the buyer was living there. Who has title to the parcel of land?
1151	An employee worked as a third-shift supervisor at a manufacturing plant. One of his duties was to ensure that all timekeeping records accurately reflected the time his crew actually worked. Workers, including the employee, were then paid for whatever hours the timecards reflected. The employee was also required to assist in submitting budgets for payroll. Needing to leave work early for a second job that he obtained, the employee had one of his trusted co-workers punch his card out at the regular time every day of the week. At the end of the week, he signed the timecard with those hours included, and was paid accordingly. He continued to do this for several weeks before being discovered. What crime has the employee committed?
1152	Two brothers inherited a tract of land as joint tenants from their parents. Only half of the acreage was planted with oranges, and the older brother decided that to increase productivity, the balance of the land should be planted with a different variety of oranges. The younger brother refused to participate in the project, and the older brother brought an action for declaratory relief alleging that he was entitled to be reimbursed for half of the cost of the improvement. Which of the following correctly describes the result in the action?
1153	The owner of a gourmet food store entered into oral negotiations with the president of a food products corporation to secure an exclusive distributorship in the state for a popular truffle sauce. After some discussion, the parties agreed on all salient points and shook hands on the deal. They agreed further that the corporation's general counsel would reduce the agreement to writing and that the agreement would become effective after it was drawn up and initialed by the corporation's general counsel and by the store owner's attorney. The corporation's general counsel duly committed the agreement to writing and sent the writing to the store owner's attorney, but without initialing it first. The attorney looked over the agreement, made no changes, initialed it, and mailed the agreement to the corporation's counsel on May 1. On May 2, the president of the corporation decided that a large national grocery chain would be a better distributor for the sauce than the gourmet food store, so he had the general counsel call the store's attorney to say that the deal was off. The corporation's counsel received the written agreement with the attorney's initials on it on May 3. Nevertheless, the corporation began to distribute its products through the national grocery chain. If the gourmet food store owner files suit against the corporation and its president for breach, she is likely to:
1154	Section 1 of the Vehicle Code of State makes it illegal to cross a street in a central business district other than at a designated crosswalk. Section 2 of the Code prohibits parking any motor vehicle so that it blocks any part of a designated crosswalk. Ped wanted to cross Main Street in the central business district of City, located in State, but a truck parked by Trucker was blocking the designated crosswalk. Ped stepped out into Main Street and carefully walked around the back of the truck. Ped was struck by a motor vehicle negligently operated by Driver. If Ped asserts a claim against Driver, Ped's failure to be in the crosswalk will have which of the following effects?
1155	Paul and Daniel entered a contract in writing on November 1, the essential part of which read as follows: "Paul to supply Daniel with 200 personalized Christmas cards on or before December 15, 1970, bearing photograph of Daniel and his family, and Daniel to pay $100 thirty days thereafter. Photograph to be taken by Paul at Daniel's house. Cards guaranteed to be fully satisfactory and on time." Because Daniel suddenly became ill, Paul was unable to take the necessary photograph of Daniel and his family until the first week of December. The final week's delay was caused by Paul's not being notified promptly by Daniel of his recovery. Before taking the photograph of Daniel and his family, Paul advised Daniel that he was likely to be delayed a day or two beyond December 15 in making delivery because of the time required to process the photograph and cards. Daniel told Paul to take the photograph anyway. The cards were finally delivered by Paul to Daniel on December 17, Paul having diligently worked on them in the interim. Although the cards pleased the rest of the family, Daniel refused to accept them because, as he said squinting at one of the cards at arm's length without bothering to put on his reading glasses, "The photograph makes me look too old. Besides, the cards weren't delivered on time." Which of the following statements is most accurate?
1156	A landowner owned two adjoining parcels of land. The landowner sold the western parcel to a buyer by a deed that contained the following clause: "Grantee promises for himself, his heirs, successors, and assigns to not erect a structure over two stories on the land." The buyer recorded the deed and built a two-story house on the property and lived there for 30 years, after which he sold the land to a movie star by a deed that did not contain the structure height restriction. The movie star decided to tear down the existing house on the land and erect a three-story house. Her neighbor, who purchased the eastern parcel from the landowner 10 years earlier, discovers that the movie star's house will be larger than his and files suit to enforce the covenant. Who will prevail?
1157	A defendant, who had been previously hospitalized at a mental institution, was charged with the murder of his wife. In his defense, he testified that, at the time he killed her, he believed that his wife was planning to destroy the world by detonating a massive explosive device that she had developed and built in the basement of their home. He also said that he had concluded that the only way to prevent her scheme was to kill her, and that he had become so obsessed with the importance of doing so that he could think of nothing else. One day when he saw her open the door to the basement, he lunged at her and pushed her down the steps to her death. The best defense raised by the defendant's testimony is:
1158	Daggett was prosecuted for murder of Vales, whose body was found one morning in the street near Daggett's house. The state calls Witt, a neighbor, to testify that during the night before the body was found he heard Daggett's wife scream, "You killed him! You killed him!" Witt's testimony is
1159	On November 15, Joiner in a signed writing contracted with Galley for an agreed price to personally remodel Galley's kitchen according to specifications provided by Galley, and to start work on December 1. Joiner agreed to provide all materials for the job in addition to all of the labor required. For this question only, assume the following facts. On November 26, Galley without legal excuse repudiated the contract. Notwithstanding Galley's repudiation, however, Joiner subsequently purchased for $5,000 materials that could only be used in remodeling Galley's kitchen, and promptly notified Galley, "I will hold you to our contract." If allowed to perform, Joiner would have made a profit of $3,000 on the job. If Galley refuses to retract his repudiation, and Joiner sues him for damages, what is the maximum that Joiner is entitled to recover?
1160	A landowner gratuitously conveyed his interest in land to a friend by quitclaim deed. The friend promptly and properly recorded her deed. Six months later, the landowner conveyed his interest in the same land to an investor for $50,000 by warranty deed, which was promptly and properly recorded. As between the friend and the investor, who has the superior right to title to the land?
1161	The victim was walking out of a store when she saw someone suddenly fall to the street with an apparent heart attack. However, that person was in fact an accomplice of the defendant. With the victim's attention momentarily diverted, the defendant removed the victim's wallet from her purse. Another passerby shouted to the victim, who turned and caught the defendant by his sleeve. The defendant pushed her hand away and started to run, but tripped over a curb and dropped the wallet when he fell, and the victim was able to recover it. The crimes below are listed in descending order of seriousness. The most serious crime for which the defendant could be convicted is:
1162	John Doe, the owner of a milk container manufacturing firm, sought to focus public attention on the milk packaging law of the State of Clinton in order to have it repealed. On a weekday at 12:00 noon, he delivered an excited, animated, and loud harangue on the steps of the State Capitol in front of the main entryway. An audience of 200 onlookers, who gathered on the steps, heckled him and laughed as he delivered his tirade. Doe repeatedly stated, gesturing expressively and making faces, that "the g-ddamned milk packaging law is stupid," and that "I will strangle every one of those g-ddamned legislators I can get hold of because this law they created proves they are all too dumb to live." After about fifteen minutes, Doe stopped speaking, and the amused crowd dispersed. There are three relevant statutes of the State of Clinton. The first statute prohibits "all speech making, picketing, and public gatherings of every sort on the Capitol steps in front of the main entryway between 7:45 a.m. -8:15 a.m., 11:45 a.m. -12:15 p.m., 12:45 p.m. -1:15 p.m., and 4:45 p.m. -5:15 p.m., on Capitol working days." A third state statute, enacted in 1880, makes criminal "the utterance in any public place of any blasphemy or sacrilege." Assume that there have been only a few recorded prosecutions under the 1880 statute. Doe is charged with violating its proscriptions. The charge is based wholly on the speech he delivered on the steps of the Clinton State Capitol. Which of the following constitutional defenses to this prosecution under the 1880 statute would be the LEAST likely to succeed?
1163	The driver of a tractor-trailer lost control of his vehicle after driving onto an icy bridge in excess of the speed limit and slid off the road. A state trooper responding to the accident got out of his squad car and walked toward the vehicle on the roadway. Before he could set up warning flares or safety cones, a delivery van approached the bridge in the oncoming lane. The van slid on the ice and spun out of control, striking and injuring the trooper. The trooper brought an action against the driver of the delivery van and the driver of the tractor-trailer. Will the trooper prevail as against the driver of the tractor-trailer?
1164	A landlord owned a prestigious downtown office building. A law firm leased the entire building from the landlord for a term of 20 years. The lease included a provision that taxes on the building would be paid by "the lessee, his successors, and assigns." The law firm occupied the building and paid the rent and taxes for eight years. At the end of the eight-year period, the law firm assigned the balance of the lease to an accounting firm and vacated the premises. The assignment was written, but there was no provision concerning the accounting firm's assumption of the duties under the lease. The accounting firm occupied the building and paid the rent and taxes for five years. At the end of the five-year period, the accounting firm subleased the building for five years to an investment company and vacated the premises. The sublease was written, but there was no provision concerning the investment company's assumption of the duties under the lease. The investment company now occupies the building and has paid the rent but not the taxes. The landlord has sued all three (i.e., the law firm, the accounting firm, and the investment company) for failure to pay the taxes. The landlord should prevail against whom?
1165	Morris was driving north on an interstate highway at about 50 miles per hour when a tractor-trailer rig, owned and driven by Dixon, passed her. The tractor was pulling a refrigerated meat trailer fully loaded with beef carcasses hanging freely from the trailer ceiling. When Dixon cut back in front of Morris, the shifting weight of the beef caused the trailer to overturn. Morris was unable to avoid a collision with the overturned trailer and was injured. The trailer had been manufactured by Trailco. A number of truckers had complained to Trailco that the design of the trailer, which allowed the load to swing freely, was dangerous. Dixon knew of the dangerous propensity of the trailer. A restraining device that could be installed in the trailer would prevent the load from shifting and was available at nominal cost. Dixon knew of the restraining device but had not installed it. If Morris asserts a claim for her injuries against Dixon, she will
1166	Trease owned Hilltop in fee simple. By his will, he devised as follows: "Hilltop to such of my grandchildren who shall reach the age of_21; and by this provision I intend to include all grandchildren whenever born." At the time of his death, Trease had three children and two grandchildren. Which of the following additions to or changes in the facts of the preceding question would produce a violation of the common-law Rule Against Perpetuities?
1167	A man had rented a woman's home from her for seven years. When the time came to sign a new lease, the woman decided that because the man had always been a quiet tenant, she would continue to charge him only $350 per month rent instead of the $500 to $550 she could probably get otherwise. The new lease was for a period of five years, and by its terms, the man was specifically prohibited from assigning the lease without the woman's specific written consent. About a year later, the man got married and moved into his new wife's home. Instead of giving up his lease, the man sublet the property to a friend for $500 a month. The man did not get the woman's permission to sublease the property. If the woman brings an action to either eject the friend from the premises or to recover damages from the man for subletting the premises without her consent, the woman most likely would:
1168	An owner by his will specifically devised his real property "to my daughter, her heirs and assigns, but if my daughter dies survived by a husband, a child, or children, then to her husband during his lifetime with remainder to my daughter's children, their heirs and assigns. However, if my daughter dies survived by a husband and no child, the property is specifically devised to my niece, her heirs and assigns." While the owner's will was in probate, the niece quitclaimed all her interest in the property to the daughter's husband. Three years later the daughter died, survived by her husband but no children. The daughter left a will devising her interest in the property to her husband. The only applicable statute provides that any interest in land is freely alienable. The niece instituted an appropriate action against the husband to establish title to the property. Judgment should be for:
1169	A patient went to a dermatologist for treatment of a skin condition on his face that had resisted standard treatment. The dermatologist prescribed a new topical antibiotic cream that was recommended by her associate. She gave the patient instructions on how and when to apply the cream but did not discuss potential side effects. The patient purchased the cream at his local pharmacy and applied it as instructed. Shortly thereafter his skin turned a distinct shade of green and he felt a strong burning sensation when he tried to wash it off. The color took almost a week to fade away, during which time he avoided going out in public and took time off from work. The cream was packaged with a lengthy printed insert that detailed a number of possible side effects of varying degrees of probability. A "green pallor" and "irritation" were listed as uncommon side effects. The patient sued the dermatologist for prescribing the medicine and established the above facts. He also testified that he would not have taken the medicine had he been informed of all of the potential side effects. If the dermatologist is found to be not liable to the patient, it will be because:
1170	Jackson and Brannick planned to break into a federal government office to steal food stamps. Jackson telephoned Crowley one night and asked whether Crowley wanted to buy some "hot" food stamps. Crowley, who understood that "hot" meant stolen, said: "Sure, bring them right over." Jackson and Brannick then successfully executed their scheme. That same night they delivered the food stamps to Crowley, who bought them for $500. Crowley did not ask when or by whom the stamps were stolen. All three were arrested. Jackson and Brannick entered guilty pleas in federal court to a charge of larceny in connection with the theft. Crowley was brought to trial in the state court on a charge of conspiracy to steal food stamps. On the evidence stated, Crowley should be found
1171	The owner in fee simple of a tract of land sold it to a farmer for $850,000. To finance the purchase, the farmer obtained a mortgage loan from a financing company for $600,000. The deed from the owner to the farmer was promptly and properly recorded, but due to an oversight the mortgage from the financing company was not immediately recorded. A few months later, the farmer approached the financing company about getting a second mortgage. The financing company turned him down, so he contacted a bank. Not having knowledge of the previous mortgage on the property, the bank agreed to loan the farmer $300,000 secured by a mortgage on the land, which it promptly and properly recorded. One day later, the financing company, having discovered that its original mortgage had not been recorded, properly recorded it. The jurisdiction's recording statute provides: "Any conveyance or mortgage of an interest in land, other than a lease for less than a year, shall not be valid against any subsequent purchaser for value, without notice thereof, whose conveyance is first recorded." The farmer struggled to keep up with his mortgage payments, and finally stopped making payments altogether on both mortgages. The bank began foreclosure proceedings, but did not include the financing company as a party. At the foreclosure sale, a buyer purchased the land, having no actual knowledge of the mortgage with the financing company. Soon after, the financing company declared its loan in default and sought to foreclose on the land. May the financing company foreclose against the buyer?
1172	The owner of 10 acres of undeveloped grassland decided to open a public park. The entrance to the park was to be by a street that he planned to construct on the edge of his property. The owner's plan was approved and recorded, but construction of the street has been delayed awaiting permits. After the plans for the park were announced to the public, a family purchased an adjacent plot from another party, planning to build a home. The family applied for a building permit that would allow them to gain access to their plot from the planned yet still undeveloped street, which was referenced in their deed. The owner of the grassland objects to the granting of the building permit on the ground that he never granted any rights to anyone to use the street. There are no applicable statutes dealing with this situation. The family brings an appropriate action to determine their rights to build an access connecting the adjacent plot and the street. The best argument for the grassland owner in this action is that:
1173	In a writing signed by both parties, Paul Plannah, a renowned architect, agreed for a fee of $25,000 to design and supervise construction of a new house for Phoebe Threedee, a famous sculptor, the fee to be paid upon completion of the house. Plannah and Threedee got along poorly, and, when the design plans were about two-thirds complete, they had a heated argument over the proper location of a marble staircase. Hoping to avoid such encounters, Plannah, without Threedee's knowledge, assigned to Donna Drafty, a newly licensed architect practicing solo, "all of my rights and duties under my design and constructionsupervision contract with Threedee." Drafty expressly promised Plannah to carry out the work to the best of Drafty's ability. For this question only, assume that Threedee on learning of the assignment refused to allow Drafty to proceed as architect and brought an action against Plannah to compel him to resume and complete performance of the contract. Is Threedee entitled to such relief?
1174	Meadowview is a large tract of undeveloped land. Black, the owner of Meadowview, prepared a development plan creating 200 house lots in Meadowview with the necessary streets and public areas. The plan was fully approved by all necessary governmental agencies and duly recorded. However, construction of the streets, utilities, and other aspects of the development of Meadowview has not yet begun, and none of the streets can be opened as public ways until they are completed in accordance with the applicable ordinances of the municipality in which Meadowview is located. College Avenue, one of the streets laid out as part of the Meadowview development, abuts Whiteacre, an adjacent one-acre parcel owned by White. Whiteacre has no access to any public way except an old, poorly developed road which is inconvenient and cannot be used without great expense. White sold Whiteacre to Breyer. The description used in the deed from White to Breyer was the same as that used in prior deeds except that the portion of the description which formerly said, "thence by land of Black, north-easterly a distance of 200 feet, more or less," was changed to "thence by College Avenue as laid out on the Plan of Meadowview North 460 East 201.6 feet," with full reference to the plan and its recording data. Breyer now seeks a building permit which will show that Breyer intends to use College Avenue for access to Whiteacre. Black objects to the granting of a building permit on the grounds that he has never granted any rights to White or Breyer to use College Avenue. There are no governing statutes or ordinances relating to the problem. Black brings an appropriate action in which the right of Breyer to use College Avenue without an express grant from Black is at issue. The best argument for Breyer in this action is that
1175	The plaintiff is suing the defendant for personal injuries suffered when she was struck by the defendant's car. The plaintiff testified regarding the extent of her injuries. The defendant seeks to testify that when she visited the plaintiff in the hospital, the plaintiff said that if the defendant paid all of her medical bills and gave her $25,000, she would not institute legal proceedings. The plaintiff's attorney objects to the offered testimony. The judge should rule that the testimony is:
1176	On May 1, Selco and Byco entered into a written agreement in which Selco agreed to fabricate and sell to Byco 10,000 specially designed brake linings for a new type of power brake manufactured by Byco. The contract provided that Byco would pay half of the purchase price on May 15 in order to give Selco funds to "tool up" for the work; that Selco would deliver 5,000 brake linings on May 31; that Byco would pay the balance of the purchase price on June 15; and that Selco would deliver the balance of the brake linings on June 30. On May 10, Selco notified Byco that it was doubtful whether Selco could perform because of problems encountered in modifying its production machines to produce the brake linings. On May 15, however, Selco assured Byco that the production difficulties had been overcome, and Byco paid Selco the first 50 percent installment of the purchase price. Selco did not deliver the first 5,000 brake linings on May 31, or at any time thereafter; and on June 10, Selco notified Byco that it would not perform the contract. Which of the following is NOT a correct statement of the parties' legal status immediately after Selco's notice on June 10?
1177	Hannah, who was homeless, broke into the basement of a hotel and fell asleep. She was awakened by a security guard, who demanded that she leave. As Hannah was leaving, she cursed the security guard. Angered, the guard began to beat Hannah on her head with his flashlight. After the second blow, Hannah grabbed a fire extinguisher and sprayed the guard in his face, causing him to lose his sight in one eye. The jurisdiction defines aggravated assault as assault with intent to cause serious bodily injury. The most serious crime for which Hannah could properly be convicted is
1178	In a suit between the drivers of two cars involved in a collision, the plaintiff's attorney calls a witness to the stand. On direct examination, the witness testifies that, while walking down the street, she heard a horn sounding, looked up, and saw two cars enter an intersection and collide. On cross-examination, the defense attorney goes over the same ground with the witness. He asks her whether there was any broken glass on the pavement, to which she responds, "Yes, lots of it," and before the defense attorney can ask his next question, the witness blurts out, "They had to be going over 50!" The defense attorney moves to strike the statement. How should the court rule?
1179	A professor who was an expert on American history conducted full-day tours through the historic sites of Philadelphia. The professor's fee for his services was $105, which did not include the entrance fees for several of the historical sites. A law student took a day off school and "hung around" the Liberty Bell monument, where the professor's tour started. That day the professor was conducting 27 persons on the tour. Most of the participants had paid in advance, but the professor was holding up a sign with information about the tour and handing out brochures, one of which the law student took. The professor accepted a few additional participants who signed up on the spot, but the law student was not among them. All day long, the law student hung around at the fringe of this group, paying the entrance fees separately but following the group through the different historical sites. However, he always positioned himself close enough to the professor's group so that he could hear virtually every word of the professor's lecture, although the law student did not ask the professor any questions. The law student signed his name and address on the register at Independence Hall. The professor noted this and took down the information. Two days after the tour concluded, the law student received a bill from the professor in the amount of $105. The law student will most likely be required to pay the professor:
1180	A state statute provides a remedy for victims of employment discrimination. The statute requires complainants to bring charges before the state's fair employment commission within 180 days of the alleged unlawful employment practices. The commission then has 120 days to convene a fact-finding conference to obtain evidence, ascertain the parties' positions, and explore settlement possibilities. An employee was discharged from his job purportedly because of a physical handicap unrelated to his ability to perform his job. The employee filed a timely complaint, alleging unlawful termination of employment, as required by the statute. However, through inadvertence, the commission scheduled the fact-finding conference five days after the 120-day statutory period expired. At the conference, the employer moved that the charge be dismissed for lack of a timely conference. The commission denied the motion. The employer petitioned the state supreme court. The court held for the employer, stating that the failure to comply with the 120-day requirement deprived the commission of jurisdiction to consider the employee's charge. On appeal to the United States Supreme Court, the employee argues that his right to due process will be violated if the commission's error is allowed to extinguish his cause of action. Which of the following best describes the viability of the employee's due process claim?
1181	A farmer owned a large tract of land. She divided the tract into two parcels: Parcel 1 comprised the northern half on which the farmer built her home, and Parcel 2 comprised the southern portion containing a large orchard of fruit trees. First, the farmer conveyed Parcel 1 by grant deed to her friend "for life, and then to his widow for her life, remainder to his children then alive." Later, the farmer conveyed Parcel 2 to the orchard manager. Subsequently, the farmer died intestate, leaving her sister as her sole heir at law. The house on Parcel 1 is old and in need of repair. The friend proposes to tear down the house and plant fruit trees. The property would be worth substantially more as a fruit orchard than in its present condition. However, the sister feels that the farmer's old house has sentimental value and wants the friend to leave the land as it is. At the time of the deed and at present, the friend is married and has two children. The common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified by statute in the jurisdiction. Does the sister have standing to sue to enjoin the friend from tearing down the house?
1182	A statute of the state of Lanape flatly bans the sale or distribution of contraceptive devices to minors. Drugs, Inc., a national retailer of drugs and related items, is charged with violating the Lenape statute. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument Drugs, Inc., could make in defending itself against prosecution for violation of this statute?
1183	Defendant became intoxicated at a bar. He got into his car and drove away. Within a few blocks, craving another drink, he stopped ails car in the middle of the street, picked up a brick, and broke the display window of a liquor store. As he was reaching for a bottle, the night watchman arrived. Startled, Defendant turned, struck the watchman on the head with the bottle, killing him. Only vaguely aware of what was happening, Defendant returned to his car, consumed more liquor, and then drove off at a high speed. He ran a red light and struck and killed a pedestrian who was crossing the street. Relevant statutes define burglary to include "breaking and entering a building not used as a dwelling with the intent to commit a crime therein." Manslaughter is defined as the "killing of a human being in a criminally reckless manner." Criminal recklessness is "consciously disregarding a substantial and unjustifiable risk resulting from the actor's conduct." Murder is defined as "the premeditated and intentional killing of another or the killing of another in the commission of committing rape, robbery, burglary, or arson." Another statute provides that intoxication is not a defense to crime unless it negates an element of the offense. Defendant was charged with the murder of the watchman and manslaughter in the death of the pedestrian. Assume that he is tried separately on each charge. The state's best argument to counter Defendant's argument in Question 157 on the intoxication issue in the manslaughter death of the pedestrian is that
1184	A man drove into the parking lot of a bank and was about to pull into an empty spot when a woman cut in front of him with her automobile and took his parking place. The man and woman got out of their cars, and the man started to yell at the woman. After a heated argument, a fight broke out between them. A customer came out of the bank at that moment and saw that the man was getting the better of the woman in the fight. The customer ran to his car, took a gun from the glove compartment, pointed it at the man and said, "Stop this minute or I'll shoot." If the man asserts a claim against the customer based on assault, who will prevail?
1185	A landowner needed money. A neighbor agreed to loan him the money he needed if the landowner would give adequate security for the loan. The landowner made out a note payable to the neighbor and secured it with a first trust deed on his house, which the landowner owned free and clear of monetary encumbrances. The neighbor recorded the trust deed. Subsequently, the landowner sold his house to a buyer, who took the house subject to the mortgage. A few months later, the buyer needed money to build a swimming pool and borrowed it from a lender, securing the loan with a second trust deed on the house. This trust deed was recorded. Several years later, the buyer got into financial trouble and was unable to make payments to either the neighbor or the lender on the notes they held. Both the neighbor and the lender commenced foreclosure proceedings. To protect his credit, the landowner paid the neighbor, and the neighbor assigned him the note and first trust deed. The landowner recorded the assignment of the trust deed. Which of the following arguments offers the least support for the landowner's position that his interest has the first priority?
1186	An unmarried couple purchased a condominium as tenants in common. Subsequently, the man and the woman made an oral agreement that, on the death of either of them, the survivor would own the entire condominium, and, as a result, they decided they did not need wills. Two years later, the man and the woman were involved in the same automobile accident. The man was killed immediately. The woman died one week later. Both died intestate. The man's sole heir is his brother. The woman's sole heir is her mother. The brother claimed one-half of the condominium, and the mother claimed all of it. The jurisdiction has no applicable statute except for the Statute of Frauds, and it does not recognize common law marriages. In an appropriate action by the mother, claiming the entire ownership of the condominium, the court will find that:
1187	Si was in the act of siphoning gasoline from Neighbor's car in Neighbor's garage and without his consent when the gasoline exploded and a fire followed. Rescuer, seeing the fire, grabbed a fire extinguisher from his car and put out the fire, saving Si's life and Neighbor's car and garage. In doing so, Rescuer was badly burned. If Rescuer asserts a claim against Neighbor personal injuries, Rescuer will
1188	Senator makes a speech on the floor of the United States Senate in which she asserts that William, a federal civil servant with minor responsibilities, was twice convicted of fraud by the courts of State X. In making this assertion, Senator relied wholly on research done by Frank, her chief legislative assistant. In fact, it was a different man named William and not William the civil servant, who was convicted of these crimes in the state court proceedings. This mistake was the result of carelessness on Frank's part. No legislation affecting the appointment or discipline of civil servants or the program of the federal agency for which William works was under consideration at the time Senator made her speech about William on the floor of the Senate. William sues Senator and Frank for defamation. Both defendants move to dismiss the complaint. As a matter of constitutional law, the court hearing this motion should
1189	A company operated a small amusement park on property it owned near a residential neighborhood. On a day when the park was closed, a 10-year-old girl snuck into the park with some friends by climbing over a chain link fence. While climbing on one of the carnival rides, the girl slipped and cut her leg on an exposed gear assembly, sustaining serious injuries. Through her guardian ad litem, the girl brought suit against the company to recover damages for her injuries. At trial, she presented evidence of the accident and her injuries. In defense, the company established that the girl read and understood the "No Trespassing" signs that were attached to the fence. The company also established that it had not had any previous reports of children sneaking into the park when it was closed. Before submission of the case to the jury, the company moved for summary judgment. Is the court likely to grant the company's motion?
1190	The workers for a municipal telephone company were sent out to install new cables at an intersection on a vacant lot where an old building that had been demolished had stood. The workers had to dig out the old cables, install new sheathing, and then connect and insert the new cables. The excavating took much longer than planned, and by the end of the day they had just finished digging a 30-foot-long trench and removing the old cables. The foreman of the workers put up two barriers along the side of the trench and posted signs on each of the barriers warning individuals of the open trench. A boy, who was in seventh grade, passed by the excavation with his friends on his way home. The boy could not quite make out what the signs on the barriers said in the deepening dusk, so he walked over to the nearest one and read it. His friends, who had continued walking, called for him to hurry along. As he ran to catch up with his friends, he moved along the edge of the excavation, The edge was soft and gave way, and the boy fell into the trench, severely injuring himself. The boy's mother brings an action against the company. The facts above are established. At the close of evidence, the company moves for a directed verdict. If the court denies the directed verdict, it will be because:
1191	A man is subpoenaed to appear before the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee and answer certain questions. When he appears, he refuses to answer and is cited for contempt of Congress. Which of the following is the man's best defense to the charge of contempt of Congress?
1192	A jeweler was commissioned by a young man to design and create a set of rings (engagement and wedding) for his fiance. The jeweler designed and created the rings in 18k gold, leaving room in the engagement ring for a large marquise-shaped diamond. She then entered into an oral agreement with a gemologist under which she would pay him $20,000 for a diamond. The jeweler's agreement with the gemologist was that she would pay him when the young man paid her. The gemologist found and cut a suitable stone and delivered it to the jeweler, who accepted it. The gemologist waited to be paid, and when he was not, he contacted the jeweler, who refused to pay him, arguing that their agreement was unenforceable and, anyway, the young man has not paid her. If the gemologist sues the jeweler for breach of contract, how much can the gemologist recover?
1193	A company operated a fleet of touring buses. It owned its own garage for repairing and maintaining its fleet. Behind this garage was a large vacant lot in which the company stored old, discarded, and wrecked buses, which it salvaged for parts or sold for scrap. This area was fenced in by a five-foot-high chain link fence, but the company was aware that children from the neighborhood would climb the fence and play among the junked buses. Consequently, the company would have one of its employees walk through the storage area during the day to chase away any children who may have scaled the fence, One Saturday afternoon, when the company's garage had closed for the weekend, a group of children climbed over the storage area's fence to play army among the junked buses. One of the children (who had been chased away from the lot before and who also had been warned by his parents not to play in these buses) was trying to climb onto the roof of one of the old buses, when he slipped on the front bumper of the bus and his arm broke through the front windshield, causing severe lacerations. Through an appropriate guardian, the child brought suit against the company for his injury. Which of the following, if established, would most aid the child in showing that the company breached a duty owing to him?
1194	Defendant is on trial for the crime of obstructing justice by concealing records subpoenaed May 1, in a government investigation. The government calls Attorney to testify that on May 3, Defendant asked him how to comply with the regulations regarding the transfer of records to a safe-deposit box in Mexico. The testimony of Attorney is
1195	Maria is the owner and possessor of Goodacre, on which there is a lumber yard. Maria conveyed to Reliable Electric Company the right to construct and use an overhead electric line across Goodacre to serve other properties. The conveyance was in writing, but the writing made no provision concerning the responsibility for repair or maintenance of the line. Reliable installed the poles and erected the electric line in a proper and workmanlike manner. Neither Maria nor Reliable took any steps toward the maintenance or repair of the line after it was built. Neither party complained to the ocher about any failure to repair. Because of the failure to repair or properly maintain the line, it fell to the ground during a storm. In doing so, it caused a fire in the lumber yard and did considerable damage. Maria sued Reliable Electric Company to recover for damages to the lumber yard. The decision should be for
1196	In a medical malpractice suit by Payne against Dr. Dock, Payne seeks to introduce a properly authenticated photocopy of Payne's hospital chart. The chart contained a notation made by a medical resident that an aortic clamp had broken during Payne's surgery. The resident made the notation in the regular course of practice, but had no personal knowledge of the operation, and cannot remember which of the operating physicians gave him the information. The document is
1197	A newly enacted federal statute appropriates $100 million in federal funds to support basic research by universities located in the United States. The statute provides that "the ten best universities in the United States" will each receive $10 million. It also provides that "the ten best universities" shall be "determined by a poll of the presidents of all the universities in the nation, to be conducted by the United States Department of Education." In responding to that poll, each university president is required to apply the wellrecognized and generally accepted standards of academic quality that are specified in the statute. The provisions of the statute are inseverable. Which of the following statements about this statute is correct?
1198	Tortfeasor tortiously injured Victim in an auto accident. While Victim was consequently hospitalized in Hospital. Tortfeasor's liability insurer, Insurer, settled with Victim for S5,000. Victim gave Insurer a signed release and received a signed memorandum wherein Insurer promised to pay Victim $5,000 by check within thirty days. When Victim left Hospital two days later, Hospital demanded payment of his $4,00() stated bill. Victim thereupon gave Hospital his own negotiable promissory note for $4,000, payable to Hospital's order in thirty days, and also, as securitv. assigned to Hospital the Insurer settlement memorandum. Hospital promptly assigned for value the settlement memorandum and negotiated the note to Holder, who took the note as a holder in due course. Subsequently Victim misrepresented to Insurer that he had lost the settlement memorandum and needed another. Insurer issued another memorandum identical to the first, and Victim assigned it the ABC Furniture to secure a $5,000 credit sale contract. ABC immediately notified Insurer of this assignment. Later it was discovered that Hospital had mistakenly overbilled Victim by an amount of $1,000 and that Tortfeasor was an irresponsible minor. In view of Tortfeasor's age and irresponsibility when Insurer issued his liability policy, can Holder and ABC Furniture recover on their assignments?
1199	A landowner and her neighbor owned adjoining parcels of land. The landowner's property was situated to the west of the neighbor's property. A highway ran along the east of the neighbor's property. Twelve years ago, the landowner asked the neighbor if it would be all right for the landowner to use an eight-foot strip along the northern part of the neighbor's land to access the highway. The only other way for the landowner to get to the highway was to use a one-lane unpaved road that meandered through the woods for two miles. The neighbor agreed, and the landowner used the strip of land regularly to access the highway. The statutory period for adverse possession in this jurisdiction is 10 years. The landowner's interest in the neighbor's eight-foot strip of land is:
1200	A car owner lent her automobile to her girlfriend for the specific purpose of picking up a pizza that the owner and the girlfriend had ordered for dinner. The girlfriend drove to the shopping mall where the pizzeria was located and parked the owner's car there. Instead of going directly to the pizzeria, the girlfriend went into a bookstore, browsed, and eventually purchased a book. The girlfriend then went to the pizzeria and picked up the pizza, which had been ready for 15 minutes. Just as the girlfriend left the pizzeria to return to the car, another car struck the owner's parked car, causing extensive damage to the car. The owner did not carry collision insurance, and the car required $800 worth of body work. If the owner sues the girlfriend on a negligence theory for damage to the car, who will prevail?
1201	Johnston bought 100 bolts of standard blue wool, No. I quality, from McHugh. The sale contract provided that Johnston would make payment prior to inspection. The 100 bolts were shipped, and Johnston paid McHugh. Upon inspection, however, Johnston discovered that the wool was No. 2 quality. Johnston thereupon tendered back the Wool to Mc Hugh and demanded return of his payment. Mc Hugh refused on the ground that there is no difference between No. 1 quality wool and No. 2 quality wool. Which of the following statements regarding the contract provision for preinspection payment is correct?
1202	The governor of an arid western state owned a vacation home and permitted his son to have a party there. At the end of the night the son failed to properly extinguish a bonfire that he and his friends had built, and within a few hours, windblown cinders had spread the fire to the trees east of the lodge. At the same time several miles away, a worker at a lumber mill was making emergency repairs to a pipe running between two mill buildings. He did not notice some of the sparks from his welding torch land in a pile of dried lumber and catch fire, and he failed to check the area after he was finished. By the time the fire was noticed by another employee, it was out of control. The wind blew both fires toward a landowner's hunting lodge. They merged a mile away and shortly thereafter totally consumed the lodge. For political reasons, the landowner did not bring a lawsuit against the governor or his son. He did, however, file a lawsuit against the lumber mill, alleging that its employee's negligence caused the destruction of his lodge. Evidence at trial established that either fire alone would have destroyed the lodge as well. Can the landowner recover from the lumber mill?
1203	In which of the following cases does Congress have the power to restrict the jurisdiction of the United States Supreme Court?
1204	A photography buff wrote a letter to his brother-in-law offering to sell him his camera for $1,500, because he knew that he had admired it for a long time. The day after the brother-in-law received the letter, he mailed a letter back to the photography buff agreeing to purchase the camera equipment for $1,500. The next day, after describing the camera to a friend who was very knowledgeable about photographic equipment, the brother-in-law learned that the camera was second-rate and not worth more than $1,200. He immediately telephoned the photography buff and told him that he had no interest in buying the camera. The photography buff received his brother-in-law's letter agreeing to purchase the camera equipment a day after receiving the phone call. If the photography buff brings an action against his brother-in-law for breach of contract, and the brother-in-law defends on the grounds that no contract was formed, how should the court rule?
1205	Husband and Wife, walking on a country road, were frightened by a bull running loose on the road. They climbed over a fence to get onto the adjacent property, owned by Grower. After climbing over the fence, Husband and Wife damaged some of Grower's plants which were near the fence. The fence was posted with a large sign, "No Trespassing." Grower saw Husband and Wife and came toward them with his large watchdog on a long leash. The dog rushed at Wife. Grower had intended only to frighten Husband and Wife, but the leash broke, and before Grower could restrain the dog, the dog bit Wife. If Husband asserts a claim based on assault against Grower, will Husband prevail?
1206	A landowner deeded her real property to her neighbor "for so long as the property is used for residential purposes, but if the property ceases to be used for residential purposes, it is to go to the American Cancer Society." A year later, the landowner died. Her will left all of her property, including real property, to her friend. The landowner's only heir is her son, whom she purposely excluded from her will. The next year, the neighbor began operating a business on the property. State probate laws provide that future interests or estates in real property may be passed by will or descent in the same manner as present or possessory interests. Who owns the property?
1207	A plaintiff sued a defendant railroad company for injuries sustained when his car was hit at a railroad crossing. The plaintiff testified that just before the accident, a bystander yelled, "Oh no, the crossing signal isn't working!" The defendant wants to place a witness on the stand who will testify that the bystander, who is now dead, told her that the crossing signal was working. The witness's testimony is:
1208	In which of the following situations would a court applying common-law doctrine be most likely to convict Defendant of the crime charged, despite Defendant's mistake?
1209	A homeowner invited guests over for an evening pool party. One of the guests jumped into the pool without seeing that a swimmer was in the water right below him. He struck the swimmer on the head, knocking her unconscious. Other guests pulled the swimmer out of the water and attempted to revive her. She survived but suffered permanent injury. The swimmer brought an action against the homeowner for her injuries. At trial, evidence established that when the guest jumped into the pool, he did not see the swimmer in part because a light in the pool near the point of impact was not working at the time, but the homeowner was not aware that it was not working. No other evidence was presented regarding the condition of the pool. Other evidence established that the rescue efforts of the other guests caused greater injury to the swimmer than the initial impact. At the end of the presentation of the evidence, the homeowner moved for a directed verdict. Should the homeowner's motion be granted?
1210	Innes worked as a secretary in an office in a building occupied partly by her employer and partly by Glass, a retail store. The two areas were separated by walls and were in no way connected, except that the air conditioning unit served both areas and there was a common return-air duct. Glass began remodeling, and its employees did the work, which included affixing a plastic surfacing material to counters. To fasten the plastic to the counters, the employees purchased glue, with the brand name Stick, that was manufactured by Steel, packaged in a sealed container by Steel, and retailed by Paint Company. In the course of the remodeling job, one of Glass's employees turned on the air conditioning and caused fumes from the glue to travel from Glass through the air conditioning unit and into Innes' office. The employees did not know that there was common ductwork for the air conditioners. Innes was permanently blinded by the fumes from the glue. The label on the container of glue read, "DANGER. Do not smoke near this product. Extremely flammable. Contains Butanone, Toluol and Hexane. Use with adequate ventilation. Keep out of the reach of children." The three chemicals listed on the label are very toxic and harmful to human eyes. Steel had received no reports of eye injuries during the ten years that the Product had been manufactured and sold. If Innes asserts a claim against Glass, the most likely result is that she will
1211	A businessman held a majority ownership interest in one of the three daily newspapers in a city, as well as numerous other media outlets across the country. When a popular radio station in the city was put on the market, he entered into negotiations to purchase it. However, the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") blocked the sale on the basis of a regulation forbidding ownership of a radio or television station to any entity owning a daily newspaper in the same city. The next year, however, the FCC suspended enforcement of that regulation to permit the radio station to be sold to the owner of another daily newspaper in the city. The businessman filed an action in federal district court seeking to enjoin the sale. The court should:
1212	At a products liability trial, a critical issue is whether the temperature was below freezing on January 16. A local man who works for a civil engineering firm is also an avid amateur meteorologist. One of the man's weather detection instruments in his backyard records temperature by markings from a stylus on a round barograph. The man's record of the day in question indicates that it was unseasonably warm and that the temperature never fell lower than 48 degrees Fahrenheit, 16 degrees above the freezing mark. The plaintiff offers into evidence the man's barograph record of the temperature on January 16. The barograph record is:
1213	The defendant is tried on a charge of driving while intoxicated. When the defendant was booked at the police station, a videotape was made that showed him unsteady, abusive, and speaking in a slurred manner. If the prosecutor lays a foundation properly identifying the tape, should the court admit it in evidence and permit it to be shown to the jury?
1214	While Prudence was leaving an elevator, it suddenly dropped several inches, causing her to fall. An investigation of the accident revealed that the elevator dropped because it had been negligently maintained by the Acme Elevator Company. Acme had a contract with the owner of the building to inspect and maintain the elevator. Prudence's fall severely aggravated a preexisting physical disability. If Prudence sues Acme Elevator Company for damages for her injuries, she should recover
1215	Arthur's estate plan included a revocable trust established 35 years ago with ABC Bank as trustee. The principal asset of the trust has always been Blackacre, a very profitable, debt-free office building. The trust instrument instructs the trustee to pay the net income to Arthur for life, and, after the death of Arthur, to pay the net income to his wife, Alice, for life; and, after her death, "to distribute the net trust estate as she may appoint by will, or in default of her exercise of this power of appointment, to my son (her stepson), Charles." Arthur died 30 years ago survived by Alice and Charles. Arthur had not revoked or amended the trust agreement. A few years after Arthur's death, Alice remarried; she then had a child, Marie; was widowed for a second time; and, last year, died. Her will contained only one dispositive provision: "I give my entire estate to my daughter, Marie, and I intentionally make no provision for my stepson, Charles." Marie is now 22 years old. The common-law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified by statute in the jurisdiction. There are no other applicable statutes. Charles brought an appropriate action against Marie to determine who was entitled to the net trust estate and thus to Blackacre. If the court rules for Marie, it will be because
1216	A landowner and his neighbor owned adjoining tracts of land. The boundary line between the two properties was never properly determined or clearly known. Thirty years ago, the landowner installed a gas-powered generator on land he thought he owned, but which was in fact owned by the neighbor. Fifteen years later, the neighbor was found to be mentally incompetent. She died last year, and her executor filed suit to eject the landowner and quiet title. The statute of limitations for ejectment is 20 years. With respect to the land on which the generator was installed:
1217	Kane, a member of the legislature of State, is prosecuted in federal court for a violation of the Federal Securities Act arising out of the activities of a state-owned corporation. Kane's defense includes a claim that the alleged wrongful acts were committed in the course of legislative business and are immune from scrutiny. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument supporting Kane?
1218	In which of the following situations is Defendant most likely to be not guilty of the charge made?
1219	Allen owned Greenacre in fee simple of record on January 10. On that day, Maria loaned Allen $50,000 and Allen mortgaged Greenacre to Maria as security for the loan. The mortgage was recorded on January 18. Allen conveyed Greenacre to Barnes for a valuable consideration on January 11. Maria did not know of this, nor did Barnes know of the mortgage to Maria, until both discovered the facts on January 23, the day on which Barnes recorded Allen's deed. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides: "No unrecorded conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value without notice, who shall first record." There is no provision for a period of grace and there is no other relevant statutory provision. Maria sued Barnes to establish that her mortgage was good against Greenacre. The court should decide for
1220	A manufacturer of insecticides vital to the local agriculture generated very foul-smelling fumes during the operation of its plant. When the plant was built many years ago, the surrounding area was completely agricultural, but now much of the area around the plant is residential, although the plant itself is zoned for manufacturing activities. In response to complaints, the manufacturer's engineers investigated whether it would be possible to install machinery to filter and scrub the plant emissions, but determined that the project would be too costly. Residents of nearby homes brought an action for nuisance against the manufacturer. If the manufacturer prevails, it will be because:
1221	A landowner and his neighbor owned adjoining properties. The landowner erected an oddly shaped building in the northeast corner of his property and opened a private detective agency. The building cost the landowner $20,000 to build, but due to its unusual design did not really enhance the value of the property at all. Four years and only one client later, the landowner decided to retire from the detective business and tear down the building. As he raised the sledge hammer to the building, the neighbor ran out of her home exclaiming that the building was on her property and it was hers. Assuming that the building is on the neighbor's property, as between the parties:
1222	A pedestrian sued the defendant for injuries suffered in a hit and run accident. The car that struck the pedestrian was linked to the defendant, but she denies that she was driving the car when the pedestrian was hit. The only eyewitness, other than the pedestrian, was a six-yearold child. During the trial, the pedestrian put the child on the stand, and he testified that he saw the defendant driving the car that hit the pedestrian. The defense elected not to cross-examine the child. The plaintiff's next witness was a child psychologist who had never met the child before but was prepared to testify that, based on his observations of the child on the witness stand, it was highly probable that the child was telling the truth. The psychologist was qualified as an expert witness with many years of experience dealing with children. However, the defense objected to any questions regarding the veracity of the child. Should the psychologist be allowed to testify about the child?
1223	A husband was on his way to meet his wife for lunch at the restaurant in the lobby of a bank building where she worked. He had just entered the building, which was owned and operated by the bank, when he heard screams and the sound of breaking glass. A large piece of artwork made of stained glass had fallen onto the seating area of the restaurant. In the seating area he saw several injured persons, including his wife, lying in the wreckage of the artwork. He fainted and hit his head on the marble floor, fracturing his skull. The artwork had collapsed because the pedestal that the bank had provided for the artwork was not properly constructed. If the husband sues the bank for his injury, he is likely to:
1224	A state passed a statute that provided for direct reimbursement from public funds to nonpublic schools, including religious schools, of the cost of performing various testing services required of all schools by state law. The three state-prepared tests involved consisted of a student evaluation test, a comprehensive achievement test, and scholarship and college qualification tests. The law also provided for payment to the nonpublic schools for the grading of the tests, which are graded objectively. On review by the Supreme Court, the statute should be held:
1225	A city council and park board announced joint plans to tear down some old buildings and erect a park. Before the contracts were made, in order to garner the greatest political benefit from such projects, the city council adopted an ordinance requiring that 35% of the work force of contractors working on city-funded projects be residents of the city. One of the contractors working on the park project employed several people from the city, but he and most of his employees came from a town in a neighboring state that was a few miles west of the city. When the city projects inspector discovered that the contractor did not employ the required 35%, he told the contractor that if he did not hire a sufficient number of city workers within 20 days the contractor would forfeit the opportunity to work on the project. The contractor immediately filed an action in federal court seeking to have the employment requirement declared unconstitutional. The court should rule in favor of:
1226	Congress enacted a law prohibiting the killing, capture, or removal of any form of wildlife upon or from any federally owned land. Which of the following is the most easily justifiable source of national authority for this federal law?
1227	Plaintiff sued Defendant under an age discrimination statute, alleging that Defendant refused to hire Plaintiff because she was over age 65. Defendant's defense was that he refused to employ Plaintiff because he reasonably believed that she would be unable to perform the job. Defendant seeks to testify that Employer, Plaintiff's former employer, advised him not to hire Plaintiff because she was unable to perform productively for more than four hours a day. The testimony of Defendant is
1228	A homeowner hired a pool contractor to remove an existing pool while the homeowner was out of town. The contractor applied a powder that, when mixed with an alcohol-based solvent, would assist in dissolving the cement used in the construction of the pool. While applying the powder, the contractor spilled some of it on a portion of a nearby wooden deck. He then proceeded with removal of the existing cement structure, leaving the site at 4 p.m., after nine hours of work. When he left for the day, all of the powder had been removed from the pool area except for the portion on the wooden deck, which had not otherwise been affected by the work done that day. The contractor, knowing that no one would be at the house, planned to clean that up the next day. An hour later, the homeowner's friend, who had permission to use the pool anytime, let himself in with a key that the homeowner had given him. When he went outside to the rear pool area, he saw that the pool was dry and that much of the surrounding area was broken up. Rather than go home, he decided to relax on the wooden deck. Noticing the powder on the deck, he decided to hose it off before he set down a lawn chair, but when he turned on the water, the powder exploded into flames, severely burning him. The powder was a silicate of magnesium that was extremely volatile when exposed to water. The warnings on the container, which the contractor had read because he was using the substance for the first time, stated as follows: "Danger. Extremely caustic. Do not use near any alcohol-based solvent except under professional supervision. Do not use near source of high heat or open flame." The friend brought an action for personal injuries against the contractor. The likely result is:
1229	A landlord entered into a written lease of a bakery for a term of 25 years with a baker. The parties agreed to a right of first refusal if the bakery was offered for sale during the term of the lease. The lease also permitted assignments and subleases on notice to the landlord. Three years later, the baker retired and, after notifying the landlord, transferred the lease to a chocolatier. Twenty-one years later, the landlord entered into a contract with a buyer for the sale of the bakery for $100,000. The landlord had informed the buyer of the lease but had forgotten about the right of first refusal. When the chocolatier learned of the sale to the buyer, she informed both the landlord and the buyer that she wanted to exercise her option and was prepared to purchase the bakery for the contract price. The jurisdiction's Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified by statute. Can the chocolatier enforce the option?
1230	Brill saved the life of Ace's wife, Mary, who thereafter changed her will to leave Brill $1,000. However, upon Mary's death she had no property except an undivided interest in real estate held in tenancy by the entirety of Ace. The property had been purchased by Ace from an inheritance. After Mary died, Ace signed and delivered to Brill the following instrument: "In consideration of Brill's saving my wife's life and his agreement to bring no claims against my estate based on her will, I hereby promise to pay Brill $1,000." Upon Ace's death, Brill filed a claim for $1,000. Ace's executor contested the claim on the ground that the instrument was not supported by sufficient consideration. On which of the following theories would it be most likely that Brill could recover?
1231	Olivia, owner in fee simple of Richacre, a large parcel of vacant land, executed a deed purporting to convey Richacre to her nephew, Grant. She told Grant, who was then 19, about the deed and said that she would give it to him when he reached 21 and had received his undergraduate college degree. Shortly afterward Grant searched Olivia's desk, found and removed the deed, and recorded it. A month later, Grant executed an instrument in the proper form of a warranty deed purporting to convey Richacre to his fiancee, Bonnie. He delivered the deed to Bonnie, pointing out that the deed recited that it was given in exchange for "$1 and other good and valuable consideration," and that to make it valid Bonnie must pay him $1. Bonnie, impressed and grateful, did so. Together, they went to the recording office and recorded the deed. Bonnie assumed Grant had owned Richacre, and knew nothing about Grant's dealing with Olivia. Neither Olivia's deed to Grant nor Grant's deed to Bonnie said anything about any conditions. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides: "No conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value and without notice unless the same be recorded according to law." Two years passed. Grant turned 21, then graduated from college. At the graduation party, Olivia was chatting with Bonnie and for the first time learned the foregoing facts. The age of majority in the jurisdiction is 18 years. Olivia brought an appropriate action against Bonnie to quiet title to Richacre. The court will decide for
1232	A vacant lot in a downtown area was condemned by the city council, which planned to establish a riverfront park on the site. During a proceeding to establish condemnation damages, counsel for the city called the lot owner to the stand, expecting him to say that he had been offered $250,000 for the property one month before it was condemned. However, on direct examination, the lot owner testified that he had received a $400,000 offer for his land a month before condemnation. Counsel for the city then seeks to confront the lot owner with his statement made at his deposition that the offer was for $250,000. The statement contained in the deposition is:
1233	During the defendant's trial for first degree murder, the prosecution wishes to introduce a tape recording of a telephone call made by the victim to police just before she was killed. The victim was extremely distraught at the time of the call and failed to identify herself. A witness is called to the stand to identify the voice on the recording as that of the victim. Under which of the following circumstances would the trial court be least justified in admitting the tape recording into evidence?
1234	The owner of a condominium hired a cleaning and junk removal service to clean his condo after he moved. The parties agreed in writing that the company was to completely empty out the condo, wash the walls and floors, and clean the appliances in exchange for $1,500. Shortly after beginning performance, the company assigned to a creditor its right to all monies due under the contract (i.e., $1,500), and the creditor promptly notified the condo owner of the assignment. The condo owner acknowledged the assignment. The company continued working, completely emptying out the condo, washing the walls and floors, and cleaning all of the appliances except for the oven before quitting the job. It would cost $150 to hire a substitute to clean the oven. The condo owner refuses to pay the creditor anything because of the cleaning service's breach. If the creditor sues the condo owner, the creditor would be entitled to recover:
1235	A plaintiff sued a defendant and his employer for personal injuries. The plaintiff claimed that she was struck on the head by a wrench dropped by the defendant from a high scaffold, on which the defendant was working in the course of a construction project. To prove that it was the defendant who dropped the wrench, the plaintiff offers the wrench itself as evidence: The wrench bears the brand name "Craftsman" on the handle, and other evidence shows that the wrenches used by the defendant on the job are "Craftsman" brand wrenches. Is the wrench admissible?
1236	Hammond decided to kill his wife by poisoning her. He asked his friend, Jordan, a pharmacist, to obtain some curare, a deadly poison, and to give it to him without recording the transaction. Because Jordan suspected Hammond's motive, she supplied Hammond with a small quantity of Marvane, an antibiotic, instead of curare. Marvane is harmless if administered in small quantities, except for the less than 1 percent of the population who are allergic to the drug. Hammond injected his wife with the Marvane while she slept. She was allergic to the drug and died from the injection. Jordan was distraught and confessed the entire affair to the police, explaining that she had failed to report Hammond's conduct to the authorities because she feared that it would end their friendship if she did. In a common-law jurisdiction, Hammond is guilty of
1237	Loyal, aged 60, who had no plans for early retirement, had worked for Mutate, Inc., for 20 years as a managerial employee-at-will when he had a conversation with the company's president, George Mutant, about Loyal's post- retirement goal of extensive travel around the United States. A month later, Mutant handed Loyal a written, signed resolution of the company's Board of Directors stating that when and if Loyal should decide to retire, at his option, the company, in recognition of his past service, would pay him a $2,000- per-month lifetime pension. (The company had no regularized retirement plan for at- will employees.) Shortly thereafter, Loyal retired and immediately bought a $30,000 recreational vehicle for his planned travels. After receiving the promised $2,000 monthly pension from Mutate, Inc., for six months, Loyal, now unemployable elsewhere, received a letter from Mutate, Inc., advising him that the pension would cease immediately because of recessionary budget constraints affecting in varying degrees all managerial salaries and retirement pensions. In a suit against Mutate, Inc., for breach of contract, Loyal will probably
1238	Congress wishes to enact legislation prohibiting discrimination in the sale or rental of housing on the basis of the affectional preference or sexual orientation of the potential purchaser or renter. Congress wishes this statute to apply to all public and private vendors and lessors of residential property in this country, with a few narrowly drawn exceptions. The most credible argument for congressional authority to enact such a statute would be based upon the
1239	Jackson and Brannick planned to break into a federal government office to steal food stamps. Jackson telephoned Crowley one night and asked whether Crowley wanted to buy some "hot" food stamps. Crowley, who understood that "hot" meant stolen, said, "Sure, bring them right over." Jackson and Brannick then successfully executed their scheme. That same night they delivered the food stamps to Crowley, who bought them for $500. Crowley did not ask when or by whom the stamps had been stolen. All three were arrested. Jackson and Brannick entered guilty pleas in federal court to a charge of larceny in connection with the theft. Crowley was brought to trial in the state court on a charge of conspiracy to steal food stamps. On the evidence stated, Crowley should be found
1240	Victim, injured by Driver in an auto accident, employed attorney First to represent him in the matter. Victim was chronically insolvent and expressed doubt whether he could promptly get necessary medical treatment. Accordingly, First wrote into their contract his promise to Victim "to pay from any settlementtwith Driver compensation to any physician who provides professional services for Victim's injuries." The contract also provided that First's duties were "'nonassignable." First immediately filed suit against Driver. Victim then sought and received medical treatment, reasonably valued at S1,000, from Doctor, but failed to inform Doctor of First's promise. After receiving a bill from Doctor for $1,000, Victim immediately wrote Doctor explaining that he was unable to pay and enclosing a copy of his contract with First. Victim then asked First about payment of this bill, but First requested a release from their employment contract. stating that he would like to refer Victim's claim to attorney Second and that Second was willing to represent Victim in the pending lawsuit. Victim wrote a letter to First releasing him from their contract and agreeing to Second's representation. A copy of this letter was sent to Doctor. Second subsequently promised First to represent Victim and soon negotiated a settlement of Victim's claim against Driver which netted $1,000, all of which was paid by Victim to creditors other than Doctor. Victim remains insolvent. In an action by Doctor against Victim to recover $1,000, Doctor's best theory ofrecovery is that Doctor
1241	The state of Atlantica spends several million dollars a year on an oyster conservation program. As part of that program, the state limits, by statute, oyster fishing in its coastal waters to persons who have state oyster permits. In order to promote conservation, it issues only a limited number of oyster permits each year. The permits are effective for only one year from the date of their issuance and are awarded on the basis of a lottery, in which there is no differentiation between resident and nonresident applicants. However, each nonresident who obtains a permit is charged an annual permit fee that is $5 more than the fee charged residents. Fisher, Inc., is a large fishing company that operates from a port in another state and is incorporated in that other state. Each of the boats of Fisher, Inc., has a federal shipping license that permits it "to engage in all aspects of the coastal trade, to fish and to carry cargo from place to place along the coast, and to engage in other lawful activities along the coast of the United States." These shipping licenses are authorized by federal statute. Assume no other federal statutes or administrative rules apply. Although it had previously held an Atlantica oyster permit, Fisher, Inc., did not obtain a permit in that state's lottery this year. Which of the following is the strongest argument that can be made in support of a continued right of Fisher, Inc., to fish for oysters this year in the coastal waters of Atlantica?
1242	A vendor sold his house and lot to a vendee for $60,000 by a written agreement that called for a $10,000 down payment and $10,000 a month on the first of each month thereafter until the balance was paid. The vendee made the down payment and first month's payment on time. He made the second and third months' payments on the 15th of each month, skipped the fourth month entirely, and resumed payments on the 5th of the fifth month. The following week, the vendor filed an unlawful detainer action to have the vendee ousted and the contract forfeited. Who is likely to prevail?
1243	A state court is least likely to take judicial notice of which of the following?
1244	A mom wished to buy her son an expensive car for a wedding present. On May 15, she visited a dealership where the salesman and the mom signed a writing providing for the sale of a specified car "if we can agree on a price on or before June 1." On May 20, the mom dispatched a letter to the salesman stating, "I will buy the car for $150,000.,' On the same day, the salesman dispatched a letter to the mom, stating, "I will sell the car for $150,000." Has a valid contract been formed between the dealership and the mom?
1245	The vaccination of children against childhood contagious diseases (such as measles, diphtheria and whooping cough) has traditionally been a function of private doctors and local and state health departments. Because vaccination rates have declined in recent years, especially in urban areas, the President proposes to appoint a Presidential Advisory Commission on Vaccination which would be charged with conducting a national publicity campaign to encourage vaccination as a public health measure. No federal statute authorizes or prohibits this action by the President. The activities of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Vaccination would be financed entirely from funds appropriated by Congress to the Office of the President for "such other purposes as the President may think appropriate." May the President constitutionally create such a commission for this purpose?
1246	The police had, over time, accumulated reliable information that Jason operated a large cocaine- distribution network, that he and his accomplices often resorted to violence, and that they kept a small arsenal of weapons in his home. One day, the police received reliable information that a large brown suitcase with leather straps containing a supply of cocaine had been delivered to Jason's home and that it would be moved to a distribution point the next morning. The police obtained a valid search warrant to search for and seize the brown suitcase and the cocaine and went to Jason's house. The police knocked on Jason's door and called out, "Police. Open up. We have a search warrant." After a few seconds with no response, the police forced the door open and entered. Hearing noises in the basement, the police ran down there and found Jason with a large brown suitcase with leather straps. They seized the suitcase and put handcuffs on Jason. A search of his person revealed a switchblade knife and a .45-caliber pistol. Jason cursed the police and said, "You never would have caught me with the stuff if it hadn't been for that lousy snitch Harvey!" The police then fanned out through the house, looking in every room and closet. They found no one else, but one officer found an Uzi automatic weapon in a box on a closet shelf in Jason's bedroom. In addition to charges relating to the cocaine in the suitcase, Jason is charged with unlawful possession of weapons. Jason moves pretrial to suppress the use as evidence of the weapons seized by the police and of the statement he made. As to Jason's statement, his motion to suppress should be
1247	A plaintiff suffered injuries when her car was struck by the defendant's car. The police arrived on the scene and required the defendant to take a breathalyzer test. The defendant was cited for driving while intoxicated, tried in traffic court, and duly convicted. He received the maximum sentence for driving while intoxicated, which is 90 days' imprisonment in the county correctional facility. The plaintiff brought a civil action against the defendant, seeking compensation for her personal injuries. At the trial of the plaintiff's suit, the plaintiff's attorney offers a properly authenticated photocopy of the court judgment showing that the defendant was convicted of driving while intoxicated. The evidence is:
1248	Penn sues Duke's Bar for injuries suffered in an automobile accident caused by Chase, who had been a patron of Duke's Bar. Penn claims that Chase was permitted to drink too much liquor at Duke's Bar before the accident. Wood, a patron of Duke's Bar, testified that on the night of the accident Chase was drunk. Wood then proposed to testify that he remarked to his companion, "Chase is so drunk he can't even stand up." Wood's remark to his companion is

The attorney refuses to produce the letter on the ground of privilege. Production of the letter should be
1250	Defendant is charged with murder. The evidence shows that she pointed a gun at Victim and pulled the trigger. The gun discharged, killing Victim. The gun belonged to Victim. Defendant testifies that Victim told her, and she believed, that the "gun" was a stage prop that could fire only blanks, and that she fired the gun as part of rehearsing a play with Victim at his house. If the jury believes Defendant's testimony and finds that her mistaken belief that the gun was a prop was reasonable, they should find her
1251	A plaintiff has brought suit in federal district court against the Social Security Administration because it denied her retirement benefits on the asserted ground that she had not reached the requisite age to qualify. At trial, the plaintiff introduced into evidence a family Bible given to her by her father in which is inscribed her date of birth, showing her to be 65 years old. The government introduced a certified copy of the plaintiff's birth certificate, which shows her age to be 55. The court admitted both items over objection of the nonpropounding party. Was this error?
1252	On April 1, Owner and Buyer signed a writing in which Owner, "in consideration of $100 to be paid to Owner by Buyer," offered Buyer the right to purchase Greenacre for $100,000 within 30 days. The writing further provided, "This offer will become effective as an option only if and when the $100 consideration is in fact paid." On April 20, Owner, having received no payment or other communication from Buyer, sold and conveyed Greenacre to Citizen for $120,000. On April 21, Owner received a letter from Buyer enclosing a cashier's check for $100 payable to Owner and stating, "I am hereby exercising my option to purchase Greenacre and am prepared to close whenever you're ready." For this question only, assume that, for whatever reason, Buyer prevails in the suit against Owner. Which of the following is Buyer entitled to recover?
1253	The owner of a mint-condition classic automobile wrote a letter to his trusted car mechanic offering to sell him the auto for $45,000, if he bought it before April 15. The mechanic researched the current market value of the car online and discovered that comparable vehicles were being sold for $48,000. On April 1, he was just leaving his home to drive to the car owner's house to give him a check for $45,000 when he received a fax from the owner stating that he had changed his mind and the auto was no longer for sale. The mechanic drove to the auto owner's house anyway, where the auto was parked out front with a "for sale" sign in its window. The mechanic knocked on the owner's door and, when he answered, tendered the $45,000 certified check and demanded the auto. The car owner refused. The mechanic brings an action for damages for breach of contract against the car owner. He will recover:
1254	A manufacturer of widgets sent an offer to a major wholesaler, offering a standard lot (quantity well-known in the widget trade) of widgets for $8,000. The president of the wholesaler personally mailed back to the manufacturer the wholesaler's standard printed acceptance form. However, the president wrote in large letters in his own hand on the form, "Our liability on this contract is limited to $200." Two days later, the manufacturer's sales manager received the communication from the wholesaler. A week later, the manufacturer had sent no additional communication to the wholesaler. What is the relationship between the parties?
1255	A farmer in a small town suffering a severe drought contacted a scientist in another county who claimed to have perfected a rainmaking machine. The farmer and the scientist entered into an agreement providing that the scientist would be paid if he made it rain. The agreement did not specify an amount of payment or any deadline by which it must rain. After several days of trying without success, the scientist said that the machine might work better at a higher elevation. A neighbor who lived on higher ground agreed to let the scientist place the rainmaking machine on his land and further told the scientist that if he made it rain before the end of the following day, he would pay him $20,000. The scientist placed the machine on the neighbor's land. By nightfall of the same day, clouds had begun to gather over the town, and the next morning it was pouring rain. If the neighbor refuses to pay the $20,000 to the scientist, can the latter enforce the promise to pay?
1256	On June 1, a jeweler placed an order for 10 classic yellow gold ring settings with a goldsmith. The jeweler's order called for delivery by July 1. On June 2, the goldsmith shipped 10 white gold ring settings that arrived at the jeweler's place of business on June 3. The jeweler immediately faxed the goldsmith rejecting the shipment because the rings were white gold instead of the classic yellow gold he had requested. The goldsmith replied by fax: "Will deliver proper ring settings before July 1." The jeweler received this fax on June 4 but did not reply to it. On June 30, the goldsmith tendered 10 classic yellow gold ring settings, but the jeweler refused to accept them. Did the jeweler properly reject the ring settings tendered on June 30?
1257	Roberts, a professional motorcycle rider, put on a performance in a privately owned stadium during which he leaped his motorcycle over 21 automobiles. Spectators were charged $5 each to view the jump and were prohibited from using cameras. However, the local television station filmed the whole event from within the stadium without the knowledge or consent of Roberts and showed the film in its entirety on the evening newscast that day. Roberts thereafter brought suit to recover damages from the station for the admittedly unauthorized filming and broadcasting of the act. The television station raised only constitutional defenses. The court should
1258	While walking on a public sidewalk, Anson was struck by a piece of lumber that fell from the roof of Bruce's house.

1259	Walter, a 16-year-old, purchased an educational chemistry set manufactured by Chemco. Walter invited his friend and classmate, Peter, to assist him in a chemistry project. Referring to a library chemistry book on explosives and finding that the chemistry set contained all of the necessary chemicals, Walter and Peter agreed to make a bomb. During the course of the project, Walter carelessly knocked a lighted Bunsen burner into a bowl of chemicals from the chemistry set. The chemicals burst into flames, injuring Peter. In a suit by Peter against Chemco, based on strict liability, Peter will
1260	Buyers of a house with an old aboveground pool wanted it removed, so the current homeowners agreed that they would arrange to have the pool moved to their new home, but since the sale was occurring in winter, the pool would have to be moved at a later date. The parties therefore agreed that the buyers would pay all but $5,000 of the home's sale price at closing, and then pay the final $5,000 six months after the sale. The contract further stated: It is understood and agreed that the purchasers' obligation to pay the $5,000 six months after the sale shall be voided if the current homeowners have not, within three months after the aforesaid sale, removed the existing pool in the rear of the house. The homeowners' removal of the pool from the backyard of the house is:
1261	A large field, owned by a city, was used as a municipal parking lot for many years. When a new parking facility was constructed, the field was no longer used for that purpose. The city officially vacated the property, except for a small parcel of land at the easterly end of the field. The adjoining owner on both sides of the field went into possession of the parcel, fenced it, and cultivated the parcel for a period of time in excess of the period required for adverse possession. A statute of the jurisdiction in which the field is located provides that real property interests can be lost by a municipality through adverse possession. In an appropriate action brought by the adjoining owner to establish his title to the parcel, which of the following must he establish if he is to prevail?
1262	Martin, the owner in fee simple of Orchardacres, mortgaged Orchardacres to Marie to secure the payment of the loan she made to him. The loan was due at the end of the growing season of the year in which it was made. Martin maintained and operated an orchard on the land, which was his sole source of income. Halfway through the growing season, Martin experienced severe health and personal problems and, as a result, left the state; his whereabouts were unknown. Marie learned that no one was responsible for the cultivation and care of the orchard on Orchardacres. She undertook to provide, through employees, the care of the orchard and the harvest for the remainder of the growing season. The net profits were applied to the debt secured by the mortgage on Orchardacres. During the course of the harvest, Paul, a business invitee, was injured by reason of a fault in the equipment used. Under applicable tort case law, the owner of the premises would be liable for Paul's injuries. Paul brought an appropriate action against Marie to recover damages for the injuries suffered, relying on this aspect of tort law. In such lawsuit, judgment should be for
1263	On July 15, in a writing signed by both parties, Fixtures, Inc., agreed to deliver to Druggist on August 15 five storage cabinets from inventory for a total price of $5,000 to be paid on delivery. On August 1, the two parties orally agreed to postpone the delivery date to August 20. On August 20, Fixtures tendered the cabinets to Druggist, who refused to accept or pay for them on the ground that they were not tendered on August 15, even though they otherwise met the contract specifications. Assuming that all appropriate defenses are seasonably raised, will Fixtures succeed in an action against Druggist for breach of contract?
1264	A plaintiff contended that a defendant owed him $6,000. The defendant denied that he owed the plaintiff anything. Tired of the dispute, the defendant eventually signed a promissory note by which he promised to pay the plaintiff $5,000 in settlement of their dispute. In an action by the plaintiff against the defendant on the promissory note, which of the following, if true, would afford the defendant the best defense?
1265	The defendant robbed a bank and fled in a getaway car driven by an accomplice, not realizing that one of the bundles of money he took had the serial numbers recorded and had a tiny tracking device attached to the wrapper. The bank's security consultant obtained portable tracking equipment and was able to trace the bundle of money to the defendant's house. The police were notified and they arrived at the defendant's house a few hours after the robbery. They knocked on the door, announced their presence, and saw someone matching the description of the robber in the hallway. They entered and arrested the defendant, and then conducted a protective sweep of the house for the accomplice, who they believed had a gun. They did not find him, but while checking a closet, they discovered several of the bundles of money from the bank and a gun the defendant had used in the robbery. The police also discovered two clear plastic bags of what appeared to be marijuana sitting on top of a dresser. They seized the money, the gun, and the two bags. Later testing confirmed that the substance in the bags was marijuana. The defendant was charged with the bank robbery and with possession of the marijuana. At a preliminary hearing, he moves to suppress introduction of the money, gun, and marijuana. The court should:
1266	A woman's boyfriend came to her apartment with a mink coat in his arms and handed it to the woman. After the boyfriend told her that the coat was now hers, the woman asked him where he got the coat. The boyfriend answered, "From the Easter Bunny." After the boyfriend left, she tried on the coat and admired how good it looked on her in the mirror. The next day, the woman read in the newspaper that the home of a well-known socialite had been burglarized the night before. Among the missing items, according to the paper, was a mink coat. The woman took the coat from the closet and rifled through the pockets. She found a handkerchief with the monogram matching the initials of the well-known socialite. The woman decided to keep the fur coat, thinking to herself that the socialite could probably afford to buy another coat. Which of the following best describes the crime or crimes, if any, the woman has committed?
1267	A husband was infuriated because he found out that another man was having an affair with his wife. The husband saw a person whom he believed to be that other man walking down the street ahead of him. The husband struck the man with a staggering blow. The husband was arrested and charged with battery upon the man. It turned out that the man the husband struck was only someone who strongly resembled the man who was having the affair. Which of the following best states the rule to be applied?
1268	A driver was operating his vehicle along a residential street at the posted speed limit when he saw a ball roll across the street. The driver did not slow down because the ball cleared his path before he reached it. A few seconds later, a child darted out into the street after the ball without looking for cars. The driver's car struck the child, and the child was injured. The child's parents brought an action on the child's behalf against the driver in a jurisdiction that follows traditional contributory negligence rules. At trial, the above facts were established. At the close of the evidence, the driver moved for a directed verdict. The court should:
1269	Dewar, a developer, needing a water well on one of his projects, met several times about the matter with Waterman, a well driller. Subsequently, Waterman sent Dewar an unsigned typewritten form captioned "WELL DRILLING PROPOSAL" and stating various terms the two had discussed but not agreed upon, including a "proposed price of $5,000." The form concluded, "This proposal will not become a contract until signed by you [Dewar] and then returned to and signed by me [Waterman]." Dewar signed the form and returned it to Waterman, who neglected to sign it but promptly began drilling the well at the proposed site on Dewar's project. After drilling for two days, Waterman told Dewar during one of Dewar's daily visits that he would not finish unless Dewar would agree to pay twice the price recited in the written proposal. Dewar refused, Waterman quit, and Dewar hired Subbo to drill the well to completion for a price of $7,500. In an action by Dewar against Waterman for damages, which of the following is the probable decision?
1270	A person about to travel to the United States was approached by a local who asked him to take a package into the United States, and the local would pay the traveler a substantial sum of money. The traveler asked what was in the package; the local said it would be better if the traveler did not know. The traveler asked no further questions. As he entered the United States, the traveler was instructed by the customs agent to open his suitcase. When he did, the customs agent found heroin wrapped in a package covered with transparent paper. The traveler is charged with knowingly importing illegal narcotics. The traveler is:
1271	A pilot was flying his airplane, which he always kept well maintained. Due to a flock of birds that suddenly got in his way, the pilot was forced to seek an emergency landing area and glided toward a field where children were playing. As the pilot made his landing, he was unable to avoid striking and injuring one child. If the child brings an action for personal injuries against the pilot, what is the pilot's best defense?
1272	A landowner died, validly devising her land "to my son for life, then to my brother and sister in fee simple." Without obtaining the brother and sister's consent, the son borrowed $20,000 from a bank, secured by a mortgage on the land, to make improvements to the land. Five years later, the son died. The brother and sister took possession of the land, but failed to make any mortgage payments. If the bank sues to recover the delinquent payments, the court should render judgment for:
1273	Albert engaged Bertha, an inexperienced actress, to do a small role in a new Broadway-play for a period of six months at a salary of $200 a week. Bertha turned down another role in order to accept this engagement. On the third day of the run, Bertha was hospitalized with influenza and Helen was hired to do the part. A week later, Bertha recovered, but Albert refused to accept her services for the remainder of the contract period. Bertha then brought an action against Albert for breach of contract. Which of the following, if true, would adversely affect Bertha's rights in her action against Albert?
1274	Gourmet, a famous chef, entered into a written agreement with his friend Deligor, a well-known interior decorator respected for his unique designs, in which Deligor agreed, for a fixed fee, to design the interior of Gourmet's new restaurant, and, upon Gourmet's approval of the design plan, to decorate and fumish the restaurant accordingly. The agreement was silent as to assignment or delegation by either party. Before beginning the work, Deligor sold his decorating business to Newman under an agreement in which Deligor assigned to Newman, and Newman agreed to complete, the Gourmet- Deligor contract. Newman, also an experienced decorator of excellent repute, advised Gourmet of the assignment, and supplied him with information confirming both Newman's financial responsibility and past commercial success. If Gourmet allows Newman to perform and approves his design plan, but Newman fails without legal excuse to complete the decorating as agreed, against whom does Gourmet have an enforceable claim for breach of contract?
1275	Johnson wanted to purchase a used motor vehicle. The used car lot of Car Company, in a remote section away from town, was enclosed by a ten-foot chain link fence. While Johnson and Sales Representative, an employee of Car Company, were in the used car lot looking at cars, a security guard locked the gate at 1:30 p. i., because it was Saturday and the lot was supposed to be closed after 1:00 p. m. Saturday until Monday morning. At 1:45 p. m., Johnson and Sales Representative discovered they were locked in. There was no traffic in the vicinity and no way in which help could be summoned. After two hours, Johnson began to panic at the prospect of remaining undiscovered and without food and water until Monday morning. Sales Representative decided to wait in a car until help should come. Johnson tried to climb over the fence and, in doing so, fell and was injured. Johnson asserts a claim against Car Company for damages for his injuries. If Johnson's claim is based on false imprisonment, will Johnson prevail?
1276	A plaintiff initiated a personal injury action against the defendant, alleging that the defendant struck her with his bicycle while she was rollerblading on a park trail. At trial, the plaintiff calls a witness who testifies that he was standing a short distance away and ran up to offer help. He further testifies that as the ambulance was leaving with the plaintiff, the defendant threatened to come after him unless he testified falsely that the plaintiff had suddenly swerved into the path of the defendant. Should this last statement have been admitted into evidence?
1277	A buyer purchased a house from a seller. It turned out that the concrete used to pour the foundation had been improperly mixed and the foundation was crumbling. The buyer discovered that the cost of repairing the defective foundation would be over $10,000. She filed suit against the seller for the cost of repairs. If the court rules in the buyer's favor it will be because:
1278	A city's water board election laws provide that, although members of the board are elected at large, one member of the board is required to live within each of the five designated water districts within the city. The city's population was more or less evenly distributed among the districts when this election law was enacted. A resident and registered voter of the city investigated the district residency requirement and discovered that most of the city's newer residents had moved into the same two water districts, so that the city's population was no longer evenly distributed among the five water districts. Instead, 80% of the city's residents lived within its central and eastern water districts, while the other 20% of the city's residents were scattered among its three other, more rural, districts. If the resident files suit in federal court challenging the constitutionality of the residency requirement, the court will most likely rule that:
1279	Questions 3-4 are based on the following statute. VEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER. Whoever in the course of driving a motor vehicle as defined in the Vehicle Code is criminally negligent in driving such vehicle or omits to do anything that is his duty to do and shows a wanton and reckless disregard for the safety of other persons and as a result of such act or omission causes the death of a human being is guilty of vehicular manslaughter. Vehicular manslaughter is punishable by a sentence of not more than 10 years in the state prison or not more than one year in the county jail. In a particular jurisdiction there are no statutory standards for the amount of alcohol required to be in the blood to create a presumption that a person is under the influence of alcohol. Defendant, an alcoholic, while driving his motor vehicle, collided with another vehicle. A passenger was killed. Defendant is charged with vehicular manslaughter. Experts will testify that a person with blood alcohol of 0.00 to 0.05 per cent is not under the influence. From 0.05 to 0.10 per cent he may be under the influence. Most of those with 0.10 to 0.15 per cent are under the influence. All of those with over 0.15 per cent are under the influence. Defendant consented to and was given a blood alcohol test 60 minutes after the accident. The test showed 0.11 per cent alcohol. Of the following, what is Defendant's most appropriate argument to the jury?
1280	Si was in the act of siphoning gasoline from Neighbor's car in Neighbor's garage and without his consent when the gasoline exploded and a fire followed. Rescuer, seeing the fire, grabbed a fire extinguisher from his car and put out the fire, saving Si's life and Neighbor's car and garage. In doing so, Rescuer was badly burned. If Rescuer asserts a claim against Si for personal injuries, Rescuer will
1281	Mermaid owns an exceptionally seaworthy boat that she charters for sport fishing at a $500 daily rate. The fee includes the use of the boat with Mermaid as the captain, and one other crew member, as well as fishing tackle and bait. On May 1, Phinney agreed with Mermaid that Phinney would have the full-day use of the boat on May 15 for himself and his family for $500. Phinney paid an advance deposit of $200 and signed an agreement that the deposit could be retained by Mermaid as liquidated damages in the event Phinney canceled or failed to appear. For this question only, assume the following facts. At the time of contracting, Mermaid told Phinney to be at the dock at 5 a.m. on May 15. Phinney and his family, however, did not show up on May 15 until noon. Meantime, Mermaid agreed at 10 a.m. to take Tess and her family out fishing for the rest of the day. Tess had happened to come by and inquire about the possibility of such an outing. In view of the late hour, Mermaid charged Tess $400 and stayed out two hours beyond the customary return time. Phinney's failure to appear until noon was due to the fact that he had been trying to charter another boat across the bay at a lower rate and had gotten lost after he was unsuccessful in getting such a charter. Which of the following is an accurate statement concerning the rights of the parties?
1282	Congress enacted a statute that purported to ban all discrimination against African-Americans in any commercial transaction taking place within the United States. The statute would most likely be held:
1283	A federal statute provides for subsidized health care benefits for all full-time college students who are also unemployed. The benefits terminate automatically if the recipient fails to enroll in college full-time in any two consecutive semesters or takes a job working more than 15 hours per week. A college student who had previously received the benefits was denied coverage when he reported that he had taken a full-time student teaching job his senior year, a requirement for his degree. The student did not receive health care benefits through his employer and was left with no coverage. The student filed suit in federal court to compel the government to continue providing him with the subsidized benefits while he finished his degree. He asserts, among other things, that there is no logical reason why he should be deprived of benefits when students in other fields who are not required to work as part of their degree program continue to receive them. Whichofethe following is the strongest ground for the government to defend the constitutionality of the federal statute in question?
1284	A statute of State X permits a person's name to appear on the general election ballot as a candidate for statewide public office if the person pays a $100 filing fee and provides proof from the State Elections Board that he or she was nominated in the immediately preceding primary election by one of the state's two major political parties. It also permits the name of an independent candidate or a candidate of a smaller party to appear on the general election ballot if that person pays a filing fee of $1,000, and submits petitions signed by at least 3% of the voters who actually cast ballots for the office of governor in the last State X election. State X maintains that these filing requirements are necessary to limit the size of the election ballot, to eliminate frivolous candidacies, and to help finance the high cost of elections. Historically, very few of State X's voters who are members of racial minority groups have been members of either of the two major political parties. Recently, a new political party has been formed by some of these voters. Which of the following constitutional provisions would be most helpful to the new political party as a basis for attacking the constitutionality of this statute of State X?
1285	Police Officer stopped Dexter for speeding late one night. Noting that Dexter was nervous, he ordered him from the car and placed him under arrest for speeding. By state law, Police Officer was empowered to arrest Dexter and take him to the nearest police station for booking. He searched Dexter's person and discovered a package of heroin in his jacket pocket. Dexter is charged with possession of heroin. At trial, Dexter's motion to prevent introduction of the heroin into evidence, on the ground that the search violated his federal constitutional rights, will most probably be
1286	A renter rented a house from a landlord. The renter and the landlord entered into a written lease providing that the renter was to pay a fixed monthly rent plus all taxes. A month later, the renter was offered a job in another state and the renter assigned her lease to a friend by written agreement. The renter forgot to tell the friend that he was liable to pay the taxes on the residence during the period of the lease. As a result, the friend failed to pay the taxes on the house. The landlord was informed that there was a tax lien on the residence. She paid the lien and brought suit against the friend for the amount. Judgment for:
1287	The defendant and an accomplice were on trial together for burglary. Both had given confessions implicating themselves and their accomplice. At trial, the defendant maintained that his confession had been obtained through improper coercion by the police. For the purpose of countering the claim of coercion, the prosecution seeks to place the accomplice's confession into evidence. After objection by the defendant's counsel, the judge agrees to issue a limiting instruction to the jury that the confession is to be considered only with regard to the question of whether the defendant's confession was coerced. May the accomplice's confession be admitted under that condition?
1288	A developer and an investor had been in the real estate business for many years. Because of their long-standing relationship, the developer and the investor, neither of whom was an attorney, often dispensed with certain legal formalities when dealing with each other, thus saving the costs of lawyers' fees and other attendant expenses. The investor owned a parcel of land that the developer was interested in, and she offered to buy it from him for $50,000. The investor accepted the developer's offer, and the parties agreed on June 15 as the closing date. The developer handed the investor a check for $2,500 with "earnest money" written in the memo, and they shook hands on their deal. A few weeks before closing, the developer called the investor and told him she had changed her mind about purchasing the land because of a sudden economic downturn in the area. The investor appeared at the developer's office on June 15 with the deed to the land in his hand. The developer refused to tender the balance due, and the investor sued the developer for specific performance. Will the investor prevail?
1289	The owner of a valuable painting hired professional movers to transport it to an auction house when she decided to sell it. As the movers were carrying it to their van, a window air conditioner that a tenant had been trying to install fell out of his second floor window and crashed through the painting and onto the ground. The owner had been watching from her apartment across the street and saw her painting destroyed. She became extremely upset and needed medical treatment for shock. If the owner brings a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress against the tenant, she would:
1290	A state statute requires the permanent removal from parental custody of any child who has suffered "child abuse." That term is defined to include "corporal punishment of any sort." A father gently spanks his six-year-old son on the buttocks whenever he believes that spanking is necessary to discipline him. Such a spanking has never physically harmed the child. The state files suit under the statute to terminate the father's parental rights solely because of these spankings. The father defends only on the ground that the statute in question is unconstitutional as applied to his admitted conduct. In light of the nature of the rights involved, which of the following is the most probable burden of persuasion on this constitutional issue?
1291	A retiree purchased a rustic cabin on a small plot of land near the center of a landowner's large parcel of land. The deed to the land, which the landowner delivered to the retiree for fair consideration, did not specifically grant an easement over the landowner's property to reach the public highway bordering her land. There were two means of access to the cabin from the public roads: a driveway from the county road on the south, and a private road from the highway on the east. The landowner told the retiree that he could use the private road from the highway. Twice during his first two years at the cabin, the retiree took the driveway from the county road instead; at all other times he used the private road. At the end of his second year at the cabin, the retiree began reading tarot cards to supplement his retirement income. He had a steady stream of clients coming to his home at all hours of the day and night. Most of the clients came in on the driveway from the county road, which ran close to the landowner's home. The landowner objected, and told the retiree that neither he nor his clients had any right to use that driveway and that they must use the private road from the highway. The retiree refused, and he and his clients continued to use the driveway from the county road for three years. Finally, the landowner began blocking off the driveway from the county road. The retiree brought suit to enjoin this practice. The prescriptive period in this jurisdiction is five years. Who will most likely prevail?
1292	A landowner owned a large commercial building downtown and the vacant lot next to his building. The landowner agreed to let an innercity Scout troop use the vacant lot to practice outdoor-type activities. One weekend while the landowner was away on business, the Scout leader asked the landowner's building manager if he would permit the Scouts to practice their archery. The building manager agreed, but insisted that the targets be set up against the building so that an errant shot would merely strike concrete and not injure someone on the streets bordering the lot. The building manager supervised the set-up of the targets and ensured that responsible adults were present to assist the Scouts, then left the area. One of the Scouts jokingly shot an arrow up into the sky, and it came down on the street next to the vacant lot, striking and injuring a motorcyclist who was riding past. If the motorcyclist does not prevail in an action against the landowner for personal injuries, it will be because:
1293	Donaldson broke into Professor Ruiz' office in order to look at examination questions. The questions were locked in a drawer, and Donaldson could not find them. Donaldson believed that looking at examination questions was a crime, but in this belief he was mistaken. Charged with burglary, Donaldson should be
1294	Santos agreed to sell and Perrine agreed to buy a described lot on which a single-family residence had been built. Under the contract, Santos agreed to convey marketable title subject only to conditions, covenants, and restrictions of record and all applicable zoning laws and ordinances. The lot was subject to a 10-foot side line setback originally set forth in the developer's duly recorded subdivision plot. The applicable zoning ordinance zones the property for single-family units and requires an 8.5-foot side line setback. Prior to closing, a survey of the property was made. It revealed that a portion of Santos' house was 8.4 feet from the side line. Perrine refused to consummate the transaction on the ground that Santos' title is not marketable. In an appropriate action, Santos seeks specific performance. Who will prevail in such an action?
1295	An avid swimmer wished to install an in-ground swimming pool in her backyard and hired a contractor to do the installation. The swimmer chose to locate the pool close to the property line dividing her yard from her neighbor's property. Unfortunately, when the pool excavation was nearly completed, subsidence on the neighbor's property, caused by the excavation, caused part of the neighbor's backyard lawn to collapse. If the neighbor sues the swimmer for the damage to his lawn, for whom will a court most likely rule?
1296	The general partner of a two-person partnership committed suicide because of gambling debts. His partner, who was a limited partner and the general partner's uncle, was besieged by creditors of the partnership who wanted their money. The jurisdiction statutorily limited the liability of limited partners for debts of the partnership or acts of the general partner to the extent of their investment in the partnership. However, the limited partner was unaware of this and believed that he was liable to all who had claims against the partnership. The limited partner told an unsecured creditor of the partnership that he would pay the partnership debt if the unsecured creditor would hold off filing an involuntary bankruptcy petition against the partnership. In a bankruptcy action filed by secured creditors, the assets of the partnership, which were very small, were consumed by the costs of the proceedings and no creditor received any payment. The general partner himself left no assets. The unsecured creditor brought an action against the limited partner for the amount of the debt owed to him by the partnership. Will the unsecured creditor be successful in collecting the debt from the limited partner?
1297	A drug dealer is being tried in federal court for criminal conspiracy with a friend to violate a federal narcotics law. At trial, the prosecutor calls the drug dealer's new wife and asks her to testify about a meeting between the drug dealer and the friend that she observed before she married the drug dealer. Which of the following is the most accurate statement of the applicable rule concerning whether the wife may testify?
1298	Miller applied to the state liquor board for transfer of the license of Miller's Bar and Grill to a new site. The board held a hearing on the application. At that hearing, Hammond appeared without being subpoenaed and stated that Miller had underworld connections. Although Hammond did not know this information to be true, he had heard rumors about Miller's character and had noticed several underworld figures going in and out of Miller's Bar and Grill. In fact, Miller had no underworld connections. In a claim against Hammond based on defamation, Miller will
1299	Members of a religious group calling itself the Friends of Lucifer believe in Lucifer as their Supreme Being. The members of this group meet once a year on top of Mt. Snow, located in a U.S. National Park, to hold an overnight encampment and a midnight dance around a large campfire. They believe this overnight encampment and all of its rituals are required by Lucifer to be held on the top of Mt. Snow. U.S. National Park Service rules that have been consistently enforced prohibit all overnight camping and all campfires on Mt. Snow because of the very great dangers overnight camping and campfires would pose in that particular location. As a result, the park Superintendent denied a request by the Friends of Lucifer for a permit to conduct these activities on top of Mt. Snow. The park Superintendent, who was known to be violently opposed to cults and other unconventional groups had, in the past, issued permits to conventional religious groups to conduct sunrise services in other areas of that U.S. National Park. The Friends of Lucifer brought suit in Federal Court against the U.S. National Park Service and the Superintendent of the park to compel issuance of the requested permit. As a matter of constitutional law, the most appropriate result in this suit would be a decision that denial of the permit was
1300	An only daughter whose father died after a long illness arranged with a mortuary to bury him next to his wife's grave. The daughter selected the most ornate casket available because she wanted it to remain closed during the wake, and she could not bring herself to view the body before the funeral. At the cemetery, however, she decided to view the body just before it was buried. She was horrified to discover that the body in the casket was dressed in a clown costume and a bright orange wig. In fact, it was not her father but a popular circus entertainer who had died the same day as her father and had requested to be buried in his costume. Although the mortuary was able to retrieve her father's body and bury it, the daughter was greatly distressed by the episode and suffered nightmares as a result. However, she did not seek medical or psychiatric care because of it. The mortuary apologized for its error in switching the bodies, but insisted that the daughter pay all of the agreed-to charges for the funeral. If the daughter brings action against the mortuary to recover for her emotional distress, can she recover damages?
1301	An uncle died leaving a piece of real property to his nephew, who lived out of state. The nephew never bothered to visit the property. A neighbor noticed that the lot was now unoccupied. Not one to miss an opportunity, the neighbor leased the lot to a tenant. The lease was in writing and the tenant agreed to pay the neighbor an annual rent, which she always did promptly. After the tenant had been leasing the property from the neighbor for 15 years, the nephew took a trip to the state to look at the property. On discovering the tenant's occupancy, the nephew filed suit to quiet title, joining the neighbor in the action. The statute of limitations for bringing an ejectment action for trespass to real property in the state where the property is located is set at 10 years. Whom shall the court declare to be the owner of the property?
1302	A family planning group submitted a proposal to the local school board to permit its high school students to have access to contraceptives through the school health clinic. After an article on the proposal appeared in the local newspaper, the school board offices were swamped with calls and letters on the issue, most of them against the proposal. During the extended public comment period at the next school board meeting, which was covered by a reporter from the newspaper, the plaintiff was one of several parents who spoke out strongly against the proposal. One of the few speakers in favor of the proposal was the director of a family planning group from a nearby large city, who described having to drop out of high school when she became pregnant as a teenager. When the newspaper article on the school board meeting came out the next day, it identified the plaintiff by her full name but mistakenly described her as in favor of the proposal because she had to drop out of high school when she became pregnant. This statement was not true and caused great distress to the plaintiff, because she considered premarital sex and artificial means of contraception sinful. In the plaintiff's defamation action against the newspaper, she will likely:
1303	Peters sued Davis for $100,000 for injuries received in a traffic accident. Davis charges Peters with contributory negligence and alleges that Peters failed to have his lights on at a time when it was dark enough to require them. Davis offers to have Bystander testify that he was talking to Witness when he heard the crash and heard Witness, now deceased, exclaim, "That car doesn't have any lights on." Bystander's testimony is
1304	Homer and Purcell entered into a valid, enforceable written contract by which Homer agreed to sell and Purcell agreed to purchase Blackacre, which was Homer 's residence. One of the contract provisions was that after the closing Homer had the right to remain in residence at Blackacre for up to 30 days before delivering possession to Purcell. The closing took place as scheduled. Title passed to Purcell and Homer remained in possession. Within a few days after the closing, the new house next door which was being constructed for Homer was burned to the ground, and at the end of the 30-day period Homer refused to move out of Blackacre; instead, Homer tendered to Purcell a monthly rental payment in excess of the fair rental value of Blackacre. Purcell rejected the proposal and that day brought an appropriate action to gain immediate possession of Blackacre. The contract was silent as to the consequences of Homer 's failure to give up possession within the 30-day period, and the jurisdiction in which Blackacre is located has no statute dealing directly with this situation, although the landlord-tenant law of the jurisdiction requires a landlord to give a tenant 30 days notice before a tenant may be evicted. Purcell did not give Homer any such 30-day statutory notice. Purcell's best legal argument in support of his action to gain immediate possession is that Homer is a
1305	Thirty years ago, a power company constructed a power dam on a river. At the time the darn was constructed, the power company solicited and received express easements from all of the landowners in the river valley, including a farmer. The power company paid fair value for the easements, which would allow the company to release water from the dam at certain times of the year, resulting in flooding of the land in the river valley. In the 30 years since the dam was constructed, the farmer's property has never been flooded, and the farmer has been using his land in the same way as he did 30 years ago. Now, however, the power company wants to substantially increase power production from the dam. All landowners in the valley were notified by the company that henceforth all 200,000 acres (including the farmer's 200 acres) would be flooded in accordance with the company's rights under the easement. The farmer reviewed the easement for his property and discovered that it lacked the requisite grantor's acknowledgment and thus was improperly recorded. The state's adverse possession statute requires hostile occupation for a period of 20 years. May the power company properly flood the farmer's land under the terms of the easement?
1306	A landowner owned a large tract of land, which he divided into two parcels. The northern parcel abutted a public highway. The shortest route from the southern parcel to the highway was over a private road that crossed the northern parcel. The other route was over a single-lane dirt and gravel path that wound for over four miles through the woods. The landowner sold the southern parcel to a developer, including an express easement in the private road across the northern parcel. The landowner knew of the developer's plans to open an inn on the property. The developer built the inn but never opened it to the public. Fifteen years later, the developer sold the southern parcel to an investor, who planned to open the inn to the public. The developer had never properly recorded her deed to the land, but the investor promptly recorded her deed, which made no mention of a right to cross the northern parcel via the private road. About a week after the investor took possession of the southern parcel, she learned of the provision in the developer's deed to the land. However, the landowner refuses to grant the investor permission to use the road across his property to reach the highway. Does the investor have a right to cross the northern parcel?
1307	A vineyard and a wine distributor enter into a valid written agreement whereby the vineyard is to supply the wine distributor with all of the distributor's requirements of wine for a period of five years. The agreement contains a non-assignment clause. Nonetheless, a few months after the agreement is entered into, the vineyard assigns its rights under the contract to one of its creditors. After one year, the wine distributor decides that it wishes to purchase its wines from a different vineyard and terminates its contract with the original vineyard. If the creditor of the vineyard sues the distributor, will it prevail?
1308	A lawyer sued a client for his fee, based on an agreed hourly rate. The client subpoenaed the lawyer's time records for the days on which he purported to have worked for the client to show that the lawyer had billed an impossible number of hours to the client and others on those days. The client's subpoena provided that any information concerning the matters handled for other clients be deleted or masked. The lawyer moved to quash the subpoena on the ground of attorneyclient privilege. The subpoena should be:
1309	Venner, the owner of Greenacre, a tract of land, entered into an enforceable written agreement with Brier providing that Venner would sell Greenacre to Brier for an agreed price. At the place and time designated for the closing, Venner tendered an appropriate deed, but Brier responded that he had discovered a mortgage on Greenacre and would not complete the transaction, because Venner 's title was not free of encumbrances, as the contract required. Venner said that it was his intent to pay the mortgage from the proceeds of the sale, and he offered to put the proceeds in escrow for that pur pose with any agreeable, responsible escrowee. The balance due on the mortgage was substantially less than the contract purchase price. Brier refused Venner 's proposal. Venner began an appropriate legal action against Brier for specific performance. There is no applicable statute in the jurisdiction where Greenacre is located. Venner s best legal argument in support of his claim for relief is that
1310	The police received information linking a man to drug trafficking and went to the man's residence, where he lived with his mother. The police found the mother at home, and she told them that her son was not expected back until later. The police informed the mother that they suspected the man of selling drugs and asked if they could search his room. She replied, "I'm finished with that no-good bum; not only is he into drugs, but he has been stealing my money to pay for them, and all the time I'm making his bed and fixing his food. You can search his room. He likes to keep his private stuff under his pillow. I hope he goes to jail." The police searched the man's room and discovered a quantity of marijuana under the pillow of his bed. If before trial the man's attorney moves to suppress the marijuana on grounds that the search was invalid, the court should:
1311	Rollem, an automobile retailer, had an adult daughter, Betsy, who needed a car in her employment but had only $3,000 with which to buy one. Rollem wrote to her, "Give me your $3,000 and I'll give you the car on our lot that we have been using as a demonstrator." Betsy thanked her father and paid him the $3,000. As both Rollem and Betsy knew, the demonstrator was reasonably worth $10,000. After Betsy had paid the $3,000, but before the car had been delivered to her, one of Rollem's sales staff sold and delivered the same car to a customer for $10,000. Neither the salesperson nor the customer was aware of the transaction between Rollem and Betsy. Does Betsy, after rejecting a tendered return of the $3,000 by Rollem, have an action against him for breach of contract?
1312	Congress has recently enacted legislation that makes it a federal crime for any person to interfere with any right conferred by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The statute may be applied constitutionally in which of the following situations?
1313	Prescott sued Doxie for fraud. After verdict for Prescott, Doxie talked with juror Wall about the trial. Doxie's motion for a new trial would be most likely granted if Wall is willing to testify that he voted for Prescott because he
1314	A landlord leased a building to a baker for 10 years, commencing January 1, at a monthly rental of $1,700. The lease stated in part, "The tenant may not sublet or assign this lease without first receiving written permission from the landlord to do so. Any attempt to sublet or assign the lease without first receiving written permission shall constitute a breach entitling the landlord to terminate this lease." Five years later, an investor approached the baker and offered to purchase the bakery if the baker would agree to sublet the premises to him. The baker agreed and executed a sublease on July 1 of that year. The investor took possession the same day. On July 3, the baker approached the landlord and asked for written permission to sublet the premises to the investor. The landlord said he had no real objection to the sublease and would execute the document requested by the baker, but only if the investor would sign a fiveyear extension of the existing lease. The investor refused to extend the lease, but remained in possession of the building. At no time did the landlord accept rent from the investor. After notice was given to all parties and the applicable grace period in the lease had elapsed, the landlord brought an appropriate action against the baker and the investor to evict them from the premises and to declare the lease terminated because it had been breached. The result of this action should be:
1315	Blackacre is a three-acre tract of land with a small residence. Olga, the owner of Blackacre, rented it to Terrence at a monthly rental of $200. After Terrence had been in possession of Blackacre for several years, Terrence and Olga orally agreed that Terrence would purchase Blackacre from Olga for the sum of $24,000, payable at the rate of $200 a month for ten years and also would pay the real estate taxes and the expenses of insuring and maintaining Blackacre. Olga agreed to give Terrence a deed to Blackacre after five years had passed and $12,000 had been paid on account and to accept from Terrence a note secured by a mortgage for the balance. Terrence continued in possession of Blackacre and performed his obligations as orally agreed. Terrence, without consulting Olga, made improvements for which he paid $1,000. When Terrence had paid $12,000, he tendered a proper note and mortgage to Olga and demanded the delivery of the deed as agreed. Olga did not deny the oral agreement but told Terrence that she had changed her mind, and she refused to complete the transaction. Terrence then brought an action for specific performance. Olga pleaded the Statute of Frauds as her defense. If Olga wins, it will be because
1316	On July 18, Snowco, a shovel manufacturer, received an order for the purchase of 500 snow shovels from Acme, Inc., a wholesaler. Acme had mailed the purchase order on July 15. The order required shipment of the shovels no earlier than September 15 and no later than October 15. Typed conspicuously across the front of the order form was the following: "Acme, Inc., reserves the right to cancel this order at any time before September 1." Snowco's mailed response, saying "We accept your order," was received by Acme on July 21. For this question only, assume the following facts. Acme did not cancel the order, and Snowco shipped the shovels to Acme on September 15. When the shovels, conforming to the order in all respects, arrived on October 10, Acme refused to accept them. Which of the following is an accurate statement as of October 10 after Acme rejected the shovels?
1317	Arnold decided to destroy an old warehouse that he owned because the taxes on the structure exceeded the income that he could receive from it. He crept into the building in the middle of the night with a can of gasoline and a fuse and set the fuse timer for 30 minutes. He then left the building. The fuse failed to ignite, and the building was not harmed. Arson is defined in this jurisdiction as "The intentional burning of any building or structure of another, without the consent of the owner." Arnold believed, however, that burning one's own building was arson, having been so advised by his lawyer. Has Arnold committed attempted arson?
1318	While out walking one evening, a pedestrian was stopped at gunpoint by a robber who demanded all of her money. The pedestrian hesitated in going for her wallet, and so the robber hit her over the head. In doing so, the robber accidentally dropped the gun, panicked, and started to run. The pedestrian was stunned for a second by the blow to the head, but she recovered quickly, grabbed the gun from the ground, and shot at the fleeing robber. The bullet missed the robber, but hit a bystander, killing him instantly. The pedestrian was arrested and charged with murder. If her attorney asserts at trial that the pedestrian should be charged with voluntary manslaughter rather than murder, this assertion would be:
1319	A city ordinance makes it unlawful for any group of individuals or organization in excess of 20 persons to demonstrate, march, or picket in the city's civic center without first posting a bond with the police department and receiving a permit. The permit procedure takes at least one working day, and costs $10. In addition to making a violation a misdemeanor, the ordinance authorizes the police department to terminate any demonstration if "any person in the demonstration, without provocation, uses, in the presence of other persons not a party to the demonstration, annoying, disturbing, opprobrious words and abusive language in such a manner as tending to cause a breach of the peace.A group of demonstrators brings suit in the state court to enjoin the city from preventing their scheduled demonstration on Memorial Day without a permit, and to enjoin the city from using this ordinance to require them to have a permit. The demonstrators' strongest contention for finding the provisions of this statute unconstitutional is that:
1320	A landowner conveyed his farm "to my daughter for life, and on her death to her children in equal shares." At the time of the conveyance the daughter had one child, the landowner's grandson. A few years later, the grandson struck a pedestrian with his vehicle. The pedestrian obtained a judgment against the grandson for damages. The jurisdiction has no applicable statute on the matter. Is the grandson's interest in the farm subject to sale to satisfy the pedestrian's judgment?
1321	Owner held 500 acres in fee simple absolute. In 1960 Owner platted and obtained all required governmental approvals of two subdivisions of 200 acres each. In 1960 and 1961 commercial buildings and parking facilities were constructed on one,RoyalCenter, in accordance with the plans disclosed by the plat for each subdivision. Royal Center continues to be used for commercial purposes. The plat of the other, Royal Oaks, showed 250 lots, streets, and utility and drainage easements. All of the lots in Royal Oaks were conveyed during 1960 and 1961. The deeds contained provisions, expressly stated to be binding upon the grantee, his heirs and assigns, requiring the lots to be used only for single-family, residential purposes until 1985. The deeds expressly stated that these provisions were enforceable by the owner of any lot in the Royal Oaks subdivision. At all times since 1959, the 200 acres in Royal Center have been zoned for shopping center use, and the 200 acres in Royal Oaks have been zoned for residential use in a classification which permits both single-family and multiplefamily use. In an appropriate attack upon the limitation to residential user by single families, if the evidence disclosed no fact in addition to those listed above, the most probable judicial resolution would be that
1322	Parker sues Dix for breach of a promise made in a letter allegedly written by Dix to Parker. Dix denies writing the letter. Which of the following would NOT be a sufficient basis for admitting the letter into evidence?
1323	A state statute forbids the use of radar detecting devices while driving. A driver passing through the state while on vacation received a ticket for operating such a device. A valid federal administrative rule, adopted under a federal consumer product safety act, regulates the design of radar detection systems. The rule was issued to limit consumers' exposure to electromagnetic fields. No other federal law applies. Which of the following best states the effect of the federal rule on the state statute?
1324	Citing traffic concerns, a city passed an ordinance prohibiting residents from holding meetings in their homes with more than 15 persons unrelated to the resident. A resident of the city who belonged to a religious group with 50 members allowed the group to hold weekly services at his home. Between 30 and 40 people attended meetings at the resident's home each week. A neighbor of the resident who was upset by the number of cars parked in front of her home on the day of the services contacted the police. Police officers investigated and the resident admitted that he was holding services in his home in violation of the ordinance. When he refused the officers' requests to cease holding such services, they issued him a citation. At his trial on the citation, how should the court rule on the resident's claim that application of the ordinance to him violates his right to the free exercise of religion?
1325	Congress passes an Energy Conservation Act. The act requires all users of energy in this country to reduce their consumption by a specified percentage, to be set by a presidential executive order. The act sets forth specific standards the President must use in setting the percentage and detailed procedures to be followed. The provision that allows the President to set the exact percentage is probably
1326	In his employment, Grinder operates a grinding wheel. To protect his eyes, he wears glasses, sold under the trade name "Safety Glasses," manufactured by Glassco. The glasses were sold with a warning label stating that they would protect only against small, flying objects. One day, the grinding wheel Grinder was using disintegrated and fragments of the stone wheel were thrown off with great force. One large fragment hit Grinder, knocking his safety glasses up onto his forehead. Another fragment then hit and injured his eye. Grinder brought an action against Glassco for the injury to his eye. The jurisdiction adheres to the traditional common-law rule pertaining to contributory negligence. In this action, will Grinder prevail?
1327	A man borrowed $5,000 from his colleague to purchase stock and agreed in writing to repay the loan on or before August 1. On July 15, the man notified his colleague that he would be unable to pay back the $5,000 on August 1. He told her that he could send her a check for $2,500 and that, in addition, he could give her an antique diamond ring that had been recently appraised at $2,200. The colleague liked the ring and agreed to accept it plus $2,500 in cash as payment for the loan. On August 1, a courier delivered the ring and a certified check for $2,500 to the colleague. She took the check but told the courier to return the ring to the man. The man received the ring back the same afternoon. Meanwhile, the colleague deposited the check in her bank, and the next day filed suit against the man for $2,500. The man consulted an attorney as to whether he has a valid defense against his colleague's suit. Assuming there are no Statute of Frauds issues, the attorney should advise the man that:
1328	A mother conveys her land to an irrevocable trust "to pay the income to my daughter for life, then to my daughter's children for their lives, and upon the death of the last survivor of my daughter's children, the trustee shall distribute the principal to my daughter's grandchildren, if any; otherwise, to my church." At the time of the conveyance, the daughter has two children and no grandchildren. The church's interest can best be described as:
1329	Philip was a 10-year-old boy. Macco was a company that sold new and used machinery. Macco stored discarded machinery, pending sale for scrap, on a large vacant area it owned. This area was unfenced and was one-quarter mile from the housing development where Philip lived. Macco knew that children frequently played in the area and on the machinery. Philip's parents had directed him not to play on the machinery because it was dangerous. One day Philip was playing on a press in Macco's storage area. The press had several wheels, each geared to the other. Philip climbed on the largest wheel, which was about five feet in diameter. Philip's weight caused the wheel to rotate, his foot was caught between two wheels that were set into motion, and he was severely injured. A claim for relief was asserted by Philip through a duly appointed guardian. Macco denied liability and pleaded Philip's contributory fault as a defense. In determining whether Macco breached a duty to Philip, which of the following is the most significant'?
1330	John Doe, the owner of a milk container manufacturing firm, sought to focus public attention on the milk packaging law of the State of Clinton in order to have it repealed. On a weekday at 12:00 noon, he delivered an excited, animated, and loud harangue on the steps of the State Capitol in front of the main entryway. An audience of 200 onlookers, who gathered on the steps, heckled him and laughed as he delivered his tirade. Doe repeatedly stated, gesturing expressively and making faces, that "the g-ddamned milk packaging law is stupid," and that "I will strangle every one of those g-ddamned legislators I can get hold of because this law they created proves they are all too dumb to live." After about fifteen minutes, Doe stopped speaking, and the amused crowd dispersed. There are three relevant statutes of the State of Clinton. The first statute prohibits "all speech making, picketing, and public gatherings of every sort on the Capitol steps in front of the main entryway between 7:45 a.m. -8:15 a.m., 11:45 a.m. -12:15 p.m., 12:45 p.m. -1:15 p.m., and 4:45 p.m. -5:15 p.m., on Capitol working days." If Doe is prosecuted under the "Capitol steps" statute and defends on constitutional grounds, which of the following best describes the proper burden of proof?
1331	Kane, a member of the legislature of State, is prosecuted in federal court for a violation of the Federal Securities Act arising out of the activities of a state-owned corporation. Kane's defense includes a claim that the alleged wrongful acts were committed in the course of legislative business and are immune from scrutiny. Which of the following is the strongest argument against Kane's constitutional defense?
1332	Pedestrian died from injuries caused when Driver's car struck him. Executor, Pedestrian's executor, sued Driver for wrongful death. At trial, Executor calls Nurse to testify that two days after the accident, Pedestrian said to Nurse, "The car that hit me ran the red light." Fifteen minutes thereafter, Pedestrian died. As a foundation for introducing evidence of Pedestrian's statement, Executor offers to the court Doctor's affidavit that Doctor was the intern on duty the day of Pedestrian's death and that several times that day Pedestrian had said that he knew he was about to die. Is the affidavit properly considered by the court in ruling on the admissibility of Pedestrian's statement?
1333	The plaintiff sued the defendant for injuries suffered when the defendant's car struck the plaintiff as she was crossing a busy intersection. The plaintiff planned to have a bystander who had witnessed the accident testify on her behalf, but he died prior to trial. At trial, the plaintiff called the wife of the bystander to testify that, although she had been facing the other way, she had heard her husband exclaim, "My God, the woman was crossing on the green light!" Over objection, the statement was admitted as an excited utterance. The defendant now wishes to call the bystander's friend, who is prepared to testify that, a few hours after the accident, the bystander said to him: "You know that accident I saw this afternoon? The driver didn't run a red light. The light was yellow." Should the friend's testimony be admitted over the plaintiff's objection?
1334	An aunt agreed to pay for any lace shawl that her niece purchased at a certain local shop if the niece wore the shawl to the town's ethnic festival. The niece despised shawls, but she really loved her aunt and did not want to hurt her feelings, so she purchased a $300 lace shawl from the shop. She accompanied her aunt to the ethnic festival wearing the shawl, and the aunt was very pleased. The aunt died shortly after the festival and her estate refused to reimburse the niece for her purchase. The niece filed suit to collect the $300 from the aunt's estate. Which legal theory will offer the niece her best chance of winning the case?
1335	A seller owned a large parcel of land. The western half was undeveloped, and the eastern half contained a grove of apple trees. The seller gave a buyer a deed conveying "the western half of the parcel from the western boundary to the grove of apple trees, comprising 220 acres." It was subsequently determined by survey that the land conveyed to the buyer was in fat 229 acres. In a dispute between the seller and the buyer as to the mistake, which of the following is most accurate?
1336	The owner of a small computer consulting firm was attending the annual trade meeting of the computer industry and spoke with the owner of a second consulting firm about doing joint projects. The owner of the second firm replied by rejecting the idea immediately, stating that she believed that the first owner was incompetent. A sales representative of a computer supply firm overheard the remark. The owner of the first firm sued the owner of the second firm for defamation. If the first owner does not prevail in this lawsuit, it will be because:
1337	A cab driver filed a personal injury suit against a limo driver for injuries she sustained when their vehicles collided in an intersection controlled by stoplights. The cab driver's attorney seeks to have the police officer who investigated the accident and prepared the police report testify that she took the statement of a witness who told her that the limo driver "drove right through the red light." The judge should rule the testimony:
1338	During a personal injury case, the jury determined that the plaintiff was 30% at fault for his own injuries, the defendant was 30% at fault, and a third party was 40% at fault. The jury further found that the plaintiff suffered $100,000 worth of damages. The jurisdiction has a partial comparative negligence statute that bars a plaintiff's recovery if his fault was greater than that of the defendant, and has abolished joint and several liability. How much can the plaintiff collect from the defendant?
1339	The plaintiff sued the defendant for injuries resulting from a car accident. At trial, the plaintiff's witness testified that the defendant ran a red light and then hit the plaintiff's car. Which of the following is the court most likely to allow to impeach the credibility of the witness?
1340	In 1975, Utility constructed a new plant for the generation of electricity. The plant burns lignite, a low -grade fuel which is available in large quantities. Although the plant was constructed in accordance with the best practicable technology, the plant emits a substantial quantity of invisible fumes. The only way Utility can reduce the fumes is by the use of scrubbing equipment that would cost $50,000,000 to install and would increase the retail price of generated electricity by 50 per cent while reducing the volume of fumes by only 20 per cent. Because of the expense of such equipment and its relative ineffectiveness, no other generating plants burning lignite use such equipment. The plant was located in a sparsely settled rural area, remote from the large city served by Utility. Farmer owned a farm adjacent to the plant. He had farmed the land for forty years and lived on the premises. The prevailing winds carried fumes from tIe new plant over Farmer's land. His 1975 crop was less than half the average size of his crop over the five years immediately preceding the construction of the plant. It can be established that the fumes caused the crop reduction. Farmer's hay fever, from which he had long suffered, became worse in 1976. Physicians advised him that the lignite fumes were affecting it and that serious lung disease would soon result unless he moved away from the plant. He did so, selling his farm at its reasonable market value, which was then $10,000 less than before the construction of the plant. If Farmer asserts a claim based on nuisance against Utility for damages for personal injuries, will Farmer prevail?
1341	A jurisdiction's arson statute has dropped the common law requirement that the intentional burning be of "the dwelling of another." Under this statute, the defendant was charged with first degree felony arson. The indictment alleged that the defendant burned down his own building to collect the insurance. At the trial, the defense called a witness who testified on direct examination that he was with the defendant at the place of business when the fire started and that some cleaning solvent caught fire and spread out of control. The witness testified that the ignition of the fire was purely accidental. The defense also introduced evidence that the witness is of good character. On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked the witness if he is being prosecuted for first degree felony arson in a separate trial for the burning of the same building. The defense lawyer objects. Should the court allow the prosecutor's question?
1342	On June 1, Topline Wholesale, Inc., received a purchase-order form from Wonder-Good, Inc., a retailer and new customer, in which the latter ordered 1,000 anti-recoil widgets for delivery no later than August 30 at a delivered total price of $10,000, as quoted in Topline's current catalog. Both parties are merchants with respect to widgets of all types. On June 2, Topline mailed to Wonder-Good its own form, across the top of which Topline's president had written, "We are pleased to accept your order." This form contained the same terms as Wonder-Good's form except for an additional printed clause in Topline's form that provided for a maximum liability of $100 for any breach of contract by Topline. As of June 5, when Wonder-Good received Topline's acceptance form, which of the following is an accurate statement concerning the legal relationship between Topline and Wonder-Good?
1343	A landowner borrowed $30,000 from a bank, secured by a mortgage on his land. The mortgage papers were signed by the landowner and by the chief loan officer as agent for the bank on March 18. The loan officer filled out the appropriate recording form and gave it to a bank clerk on March 19, instructing him to file the papers at the county recorder's office. The bank clerk inadvertently misplaced the papers. He discovered the papers on April 10 and filed them with the county recorder. At the recorder's office, the bank clerk discovered a conveyance of the landowner's land from the landowner to a buyer dated April 5 and recorded on April 8. Subsequent inquiry revealed that the buyer paid the landowner $150,000 for the land after a diligent title search and that the buyer had no knowledge of the mortgage on the property until the loan officer contacted her on April 11. The jurisdiction in which the landuis located follows the lien theory of mortgages, and has a statute providing: "Any conveyance of an interest in land shall not be valid against any subsequent purchaser for value without notice thereof who first records." If the bank seeks a declaration from the court that the buyer owns the land subject to a $30,000 mortgage with the bank, is the bank likely to prevail?
1344	Read the summaries of the decisions in the four cases (A- D) below. Then decide which is most applicable as a precedent to each of the cases in the questions that follow, and indicate each choice by marking the corresponding space on the answer sheet. Policeman, having a warrant for Defendant's arrest for a felonious assault, went to his home to arrest him. Defendant, however, resisted and during the ensuing struggle stabbed Policeman fatally with a butcher knife.
1345	A landowner conveyed a large tract of land to a man and a woman by a deed that created a co-tenancy in equal shares with right of survivorship. The man, by deed, then conveyed "my undivided, one-half interest" in the tract of land to a third party. The man has since died. The jurisdiction has no statute directly applicable to this situation. In an action between the woman and the third party, in which both claim sole title to the tract of land, the woman will prevail only if:
1346	The manager of a department store noticed that Paula was carrying a scarf with her as she examined various items in the blouse department. The manager recognized the scarf as an expensive one carried by the store. Paula was trying to find a blouse that matched a color in the scarf, and, after a while, found one. The manager then saw Paula put the scarf into her purse, pay for the blouse, and head for the door. The manager, who was eight inches taller than Paula, blocked Paula's way to the door and asked to see the scarf in Paula's purse. Paula produced the scarf, as well as a receipt for it, showing that it had been purchased from the store on the previous day. The manager then told Paula there was no problem, and stepped out of her way. If Paula brings a claim against the store based on false imprisonment, the store's best defense would be that
1347	Widgets are manufactured wholly from raw materials mined and processed in the state of Green. The only two manufacturers of widgets in the United States are also located in that state. However, their widgets are purchased by retailers located in every state. The legislature of the state of Green is considering the adoption of a statute that would impose a tax solely on the manufacture of widgets. The tax is to be calculated at 3% of their wholesale value. Which of the following arguments would be LEAST helpful to the state in defending the constitutionality of this proposed state tax on widgets?
1348	The owner of a speedboat let his friend operate it in a busy channel. While operating the boat, the friend collided with a canoe that had the right of way, injuring its occupant. The canoeist filed suit against both the owner and the friend, alleging that the friend was negligent in operating the boat and that the owner was negligent in letting him operate it, having reason to know that the friend was not qualified to operate a boat. The jurisdiction follows traditional rules for joint and several liability and contribution. There is no other applicable statute. If the jury finds both defendants liable and assesses the plaintiff's damages at $100,000, how should the judgment be entered?
1349	Allen and Barker are equal tenants in common of a strip of land 10feet wide and 100feet deep which lies between the lots on which their respective homes are situated. Both Allen and Barker need the use of the 10-foot strip as a driveway; and each fears that a new neighbor might seek partition and leave him with an unusable 5-foot strip. The best advice about how to solve their problem is
1350	A state statute makes it a crime to operate a motor vehicle while intoxicated. Another state statute provides that a blood alcohol level of .10 raises a presumption of intoxication. A state police officer spotted the defendant's pickup weaving from lane to lane on the highway and stopped the truck. The defendant took a breathalyzer test that indicated a .12 blood alcohol level. He was charged with operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated. At trial, at the close of all the evidence, and over the defendant's objection, the judge instructed the jury: "If you are convinced that, at the time the defendant was pulled over, his blood alcohol level was .10 or greater, you must presume that he was intoxicated." The defendant was convicted, and he is appealing on the ground that the judge's instruction was improper. The appellate court should:
1351	Arthur and Celia, brother and sister, both of legal age, inherited Goodacre, their childhood home, from their father. They thereby became tenants in common. Goodacre had never been used as anything except a residence. Arthur had been residing on Goodacre with his father at the time his father died. Celia had been residing in a distant city. After their father's funeral, Arthur continued to live on Goodacre, but Celia returned to her own residence. There was no discussion between Arthur and Celia concerning their common ownership, nor had there ever been any administration of their father's estate. Arthur paid all taxes, insurance, and other carrying charges on Goodacre. He paid no rent or other compensation to Celia, nor did Celia request any such payment. Thirty years later, a series of disputes arose between Arthur and Celia for the first time concerning their respective rights to Goodacre. The jurisdiction where the land is located recognizes the usual common-law types of cotenancies, and there is no applicable legislation on the subject. If Arthur claims the entire title to Goodacre in fee simple and brings an action against Celia to quiet title in himself, and if the state where the land is located has an ordinary 20-year adverse possession statute, the decision should be for
1352	Owner and his employee, Driver, consult Attorney about a motor vehicle collision resulting in a suit by Litigant against Owner and Driver as joint defendants. Attorney calls Irving, his investigator, into the conference to make notes of what is said, and those present discuss the facts of the collision and Owner's insurance. Owner thereafter files a cross-claim against Driver for indemnity for any damages obtained by Litigant. Litigant calls Driver to testify in Litigant's case in chief to admissions made by Owner in the conference. On objection by Owner, the court should rule that Driver's testimony is
1353	A state statute provides that persons moving into a community to attend a college on a full-time basis may not vote in any elections for local or state officials that are held in that community. Instead, the statute provides that for voting purposes all such persons shall retain their residence in the community from which they came. In that state the age of majority is eighteen. Which of the following is the strongest argument to demonstrate the unconstitutionality of this state statute?
1354	A woman who had befriended a four-year-old girl told the girl that her mother had to go out of town and that her mother had asked the woman to take care of her for the day instead of going to the preschool. Although the girl had been taught to never talk to strangers, she did not consider the woman to be a stranger and readily believed her. The woman took the girl to the zoo. She had a fun day with the woman, and then the woman returned the girl to her mother's porch and drove off. After the girl's mother found out what happened, the woman was arrested and charged in a jurisdiction that maintains a traditional, common law definition of criminal false imprisonment and has a typical, modern kidnapping statute. The woman can be properly convicted of and sentenced for:
1355	The owner of a store in a small beach town contacted a manufacturer about buying 100 Adirondack chairs. The parties reduced their agreement to sell and buy the 100 chairs to a signed writing that contained all of the essential terms, as well as a merger clause. When the chairs were delivered to the store owner, she discovered that they were not "Adirondack chairs," as she understood that term and as that term was commonly used, but a different style of chair altogether that was manufactured in the Adirondack region of New York. The store owner refused delivery, and the manufacturer sued the store owner for breach of contract, arguing that he complied with the terms of the contract. Will the store owner be allowed to introduce evidence of the meaning of the term 'Adirondack chair"?
1356	The Drug Control Act is a federal law that seeks to control those substances that are dangerous to the health of the population in general. The statute provides substantial penalties for violations of the Act. The Food and Drug Administration has conducted a substantial number of tests on a new diet pill. The results of the studies show that the drug might have dangerous side effects when taken regularly, and the Food and Drug Administration now seeks to prohibit its distribution under the Drug Control Act. A major pharmaceutical company that desires to market the diet pill sues to have the statute declared unconstitutional. The most likely result in this suit is that the statute will be declared to be:
1357	A state statute provided for criminal penalties for "knowingly selling alcoholic beverages in violation of the regulations of the State Liquor Commission to any person under the age of 18." One of the State Liquor Commission regulations provided that "before an alcoholic beverage is sold to any person between the ages of 17 and 24, the seller must demand some form of photo identification to determine the buyer's age." A minor who looked much older than his age of 17 walked into a tavern located in the state and asked the bartender for a beer. The bartender never asked the minor for any form of identification, as he thought that he was at least 25 years old. Had the bartender asked for identification, the minor would have shown him a fake identification card showing that he was 21 years old. The bartender served the beer to the minor, who consumed it on the premises. The bartender was subsequently charged under the state statute for selling the beer to the minor. The bartender is:
1358	Poe ordered some merchandise from Store. When the merchandise was delivered, Poe decided that it was not what he had ordered, and he returned it for credit. Store refused to credit Poe's account, continued to bill him, and, after 90 days, turned the account over to Kane, a bill collector, for collection. Kane called at Poe's house at 7 p.m. on a summer evening while many of Poe's neighbors were seated on their porches. When Poe opened the door, Kane, who was standing just outside the door, raised an electrically amplified bullhorn to his mouth. In a voice that could be heard a block away, Kane called Poe a "deadbeat" and asked him when he intended to pay his bill to Store. Poe, greatly angered, slammed the door shut. The door struck the bullhorn and jammed it forcibly against Kane's face. As a consequence, Kane lost his front teeth. If Kane asserts a claim of battery against Poe, will Kane prevail?
1359	Drew was tried for the July 21 murder of Victor. Drew called William to testify that on July 20 Drew said that he was about to leave that day to visit relatives in a distant state. The testimony Is
1360	In the prosecution of the defendant for bank robbery, it is established that as the robber came out of the bank, he was seen entering a car by a group of people, including a witness and his friend. The witness is prepared to testify that as the car drove off, someone yelled, "Get that number," whereupon the friend screamed, "I've got it. The number is 07771!" The witness's testimony is:
1361	A state enacted a statute requiring the parents of every child to have the child vaccinated for smallpox before the child's third birthday. Failure to comply was a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of $500 or six months in the county jail. The parents of an infant living within the state objected to application of the statute to their child on the ground that any injections or vaccinations violated the tenets and beliefs of their religion. The parents have commenced an action in federal court to declare the statute unconstitutional on the ground that it violates their right to the free exercise of their religion under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The best argument to defeat their action is that:
1362	A foreign student who had entered the United States on a student visa four years ago was notified by the Immigration and Naturalization Service that he was subject to being deported because his visa had expired. Federal law provided that an alien who is subject to being deported has the right to appear before an administrative officer appointed by the Attorney General's office for a hearing on whether he should be deported. This officer, appointed by the executive branch of the government, has the right under law to make a final order concerning whether the alien should be deported. After a hearing, the administrative officer entered an order allowing the student to remain in the United States as a permanent resident. However, a congressional rule permitted the House of Representatives, by resolution, to deport "undesirable aliens." After the administrative judge entered his order, the House passed a resolution that the student should be deported. The student petitioned the federal court to declare the legislative resolution invalid. The court should find the resolution:
1363	By mutual agreement, a brother and sister purchased a 10-acre parcel of land and took title "as joint tenants with right of survivorship." Three years after the purchase, the brother asked if he could build an apartment house on his half of the property; the sister agreed. He then built an apartment house on the eastern five acres of the property. Two years later, the brother died, leaving his entire estate to his son. In an action for partition, if the brother's estate is judged the owner of the eastern five acres, it will be because:
1364	The legislature of State X is debating reforms in the law governing insanity. Two reforms have been proposed. Proposal A would eliminate the insanity defense altogether. Proposal B would retain the defense but place on the defendant the burden of proving insanity by a preponderance of the evidence. Opponents of the reforms argue that the proposals would be unconstitutional under the due process clause of the United States Constitution. Which of the proposed reforms would be unconstitutional?
1365	When Esther, Gray's 21-year-old daughter, finished college, Gray handed her a signed memorandum stating that if she would go to law school for three academic years, he would pay her tuition, room, and board and would "give her a $1,000 bonus" for each "A" she got in law school. Esther's uncle, Miller, who was present on this occasion, read the memorandum and thereupon said to Esther, "and if he doesn't pay your expenses, I will." Gray paid her tuition, room, and board for her first year but died just before the end of that year. Subsequently, Esther learned that she had received two "A's" in the second semester. The executor of Gray's estate has refused to pay her anything for the two "A's" and has told her that the estate will no longer pay her tuition, room, and board in law school. In an action by Esther against Miller on account of the executor's repudiation of Gray's promise to pay future tuition, room, and board, which of the following would be Miller's strongest defense?
1366	Albert engaged Bertha, an inexperienced actress, to do a small role in a new Broadway-play for a period of six months at a salary of $200 a week. Bertha turned down another role in order to accept this engagement. On the third day of the run, Bertha was hospitalized with influenza and Helen was hired to do the part. A week later, Bertha recovered, but Albert refused to accept her services for the remainder of the contract period. Bertha then brought an action against Albert for breach of contract. Which of the following is Bertha's best legal theory?
1367	A woman entered a dress shop that had displayed in its window a red dress priced at $120 and told the salesperson that she wanted to purchase the dress in her size. The salesperson rang up the sale and handed the woman a box that contained the dress she had just purchased. When the woman got home, she opened the box and discovered a dress exactly like the one in the store window, except that it was yellow. The dress had a tag which read: This dress shop expressly warrants that this dress shall be free of manufacturing defects for five days. If a dress is defective, liability shall be limited to the cost of repair or replacement of defective merchandise. The woman returned to the dress shop and demanded an exchange or refund. The salesperson refused on the grounds that the dress was not defective. If the woman files suit for a refund, who will prevail?
1368	An elderly man wrote a note to a friend stating that he wanted her to have his house and land. The man then went to his lawyer and had her draft a deed conveying the property to his friend. The man validly executed the deed and gave both the note and the executed deed to the lawyer, telling her to give them to the friend on his death. The man continued to live on the property until his death one year later. Shortly thereafter, his will was admitted to probate; it left all of his property to a cousin. Prior to the probate of the estate, the friend received the note and deed from the lawyer, and promptly recorded the deed. After probate, she brought an appropriate action to quiet title to the property conveyed by the deed. In that action, the court should find for:
1369	A defendant is on trial for violating a statute forbidding possession of a concealed weapon within 100 yards of a government building. The prosecution presents evidence that the defendant was arrested on a street corner with a handgun in his pocket. The building housing the local city hall occupies the entire block on the north and east sides of the two streets where the defendant was apprehended. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding judicial notice of the location of the city hall?
1370	A builder and a wealthy landowner entered into a written contract whereby the builder would build on the grounds of the landowner's estate a mausoleum, using imported Italian granite, to hold the remains of the landowner's recently deceased wife. The cost of the mausoleum was set at $100,000. After the contract was signed but before construction began, the builder learned that an unforeseen embargo prevented him from getting the granite he planned to use to build the mausoleum. He could get the granite from another source, but it would cost an additional $25,000. The builder explained the situation to the landowner, who agreed to pay $125,000 to have the mausoleum built. The builder prepared a writing stating that the price for the mausoleum was now $125,000. Both the builder and the landowner signed the writing. After the work was completed, the landowner gave the builder a certified check for $100,000 and refused to pay one penny more. If the builder brings suit against the landowner to recover the additional $25,000, will the builder likely prevail?
1371	A man and a woman purchased a parcel of land, taking title as joint tenants. Two years later, they married and had a son. Several years after that,the man and woman divorced. After the divorce, the woman and her son continued the land, although title remained in the names of both the man and the woman. The man moved out of the state and conveyed all of his title and interest in the land by deed to the son. Shortly thereafter, the man was killed in an automobile collision. The man died intestate. Who has title to the land?
1372	A 14-year-old was the youngest licensed pilot in the state. On a foggy day when pilots were being advised to fly only if necessary, the pilot took his plane out so that he could fly low over the football field where his friends were practicing. When he attempted to land on his return to the airport, he ran off the runway due to the fog and damaged an executive's airplane, which was in the parking area. If the executive sues the pilot for damage to his airplane and prevails, it will be because:
1373	A minor entered a liquor store and asked the cashier to let him purchase a case of beer for a party even though he was underage. The cashier agreed as long as he paid double the retail price for the beer as compensation for the risks of the sale. As the cashier started to ring up the transaction, an undercover officer who overheard them intervened and arrested them. The state criminal code provides that it is a felony to knowingly provide alcohol to any person under the age of 21. If the state follows the unilateral theory of conspiracy:
1374	Park brought an action against Dan for injuries received in an automobile accident, alleging negligence in that Dan was speeding and inattentive. Park calls White to testify that Dan had a reputation in the community of being a reckless driver and was known as "dare-devil Dan." White's testimony is
1375	A plaintiff applied for a life insurance policy and was required to submit to a physical examination to qualify for the policy. During the course of the examination, the plaintiff told the physician, who was approved by the life insurance company and had never seen the plaintiff before, "I used to have some back trouble, but that's all cleared up now." A few weeks after the examination, the defendant's automobile struck the rear end of a car in which the plaintiff was riding as a passenger. The plaintiff now claims that he suffers persistent lower back pain and sues the defendant for damages. After laying a proper foundation that the plaintiff is attempting to perpetrate a fraud, the defendant calls the physician as a witness and seeks to have her testify as to the plaintiff's statement to her. The plaintiff's attorney objects on the ground of the jurisdiction's physician-patient privilege. The testimony as to the plaintiff's statement is:
1376	An ordinance of a city makes it unlawful to park a motor vehicle on a city street within 10 feet of a fire hydrant. At 1:55 p.m., a man, realizing he must be in the bank before it closed at 2 p.m. and finding no other space available, parked his automobile in front of a fire hydrant on a city street. The man then hurried into the bank, leaving his elderly neighbor as a passenger in the rear seat of the car. About five minutes later, and while the man was still in the bank, a woman was driving down the street. The woman swerved to avoid what she mistakenly thought was a hole in the street and sideswiped the man's car. The man's car was turned over on top of the hydrant, breaking the hydrant and causing a small flood of water. The man's car was severely damaged and the elderly neighbor was badly injured. If the elderly neighbor asserts a claim against the man, the most likely result is that the elderly neighbor will:
1377	The following events took place in a state that does not recognize the common-law marriage. The state does recognize the common-law estate of tenancy by the entirety and has no statute on the subject. Wade Sloan and Mary Isaacs, who were never formally married, lived together over a sevenyear period. During this time Mary identified herself as "Mrs. Sloan" with the knowledge and consent of Wade, Wade and Mary maintained several charge accounts at retail stores under the names "Mr. and Mrs. Wade Sloan," and they filed joint income tax returns as Mr. and Mrs. Sloan. Within this period Wade decided to buy a home. The deed was in proper form and identified the grantees as "Wade Sloan and Mary Sloan, his wife, and their heirs and assigns forever as tenants by the entirety." Wade made a down payment of $10,000, and gave a note and mortgage for the unpaid balance. Both Wade and Mary signed the note and mortgage for the unpaid balance. Both Wade and Mary signed the note and mortgage as husband and wife. Wade made the monthly payments as they become due until he and Mary had a disagreement and he abandoned her and the house. Mary then made the payments for three months. She then brought an action against Wade for partition of the land in question. 'The prayer for partition should be
1378	Victim, injured by Driver in an auto accident, employed attorney First to represent him in the matter. Victim was chronically insolvent and expressed doubt whether he could promptly get necessary medical treatment. Accordingly, First wrote into their contract his promise to Victim "to pay from any settlementtwith Driver compensation to any physician who provides professional services for Victim's injuries." The contract also provided that First's duties were "'nonassignable." First immediately filed suit against Driver. Victim then sought and received medical treatment, reasonably valued at S1,000, from Doctor, but failed to inform Doctor of First's promise. After receiving a bill from Doctor for $1,000, Victim immediately wrote Doctor explaining that he was unable to pay and enclosing a copy of his contract with First. Victim then asked First about payment of this bill, but First requested a release from their employment contract. stating that he would like to refer Victim's claim to attorney Second and that Second was willing to represent Victim in the pending lawsuit. Victim wrote a letter to First releasing him from their contract and agreeing to Second's representation. A copy of this letter was sent to Doctor. Second subsequently promised First to represent Victim and soon negotiated a settlement of Victim's claim against Driver which netted $1,000, all of which was paid by Victim to creditors other than Doctor. Victim remains insolvent. In an action by Doctor against Second, Second is most likely to argue on these facts that
1379	An attorney was staying at a hotel while traveling to work on a case. The normal room charges were $150 per night. The attorney made a deal with the hotel management to pay $700 per week for his room for an indefinite period. The attorney never told the hotel management exactly how long he planned to stay or how he would pay, but each Sunday he would present the cashier with a check for $700, plus any additional taxes and room charges, to pay for the previous week's lodging. He did this for four weeks, and then the case he was working on was settled. On a Thursday morning, before checkout time for that day, the attorney tendered the hotel cashier a check for $400 plus additional charges incurred from Sunday through Wednesday nights. The cashier promptly took the check and then demanded that the attorney pay an additional $1,000 plus taxes for 10 more days' lodging, covering the rest of the week plus an additional week because he did not give a week's notice that he planned to vacate. The attorney refused to pay the additional charges. If the hotel sues the attorney and the court determines that the parties created a tenancy, for how many additional days' lodging will he be required to pay?
1380	The owner of an exclusive clothing salon entered into a written agreement with a customer to sell the customer a certain full-length fake fur coat for $12,000, with delivery by December 7. On December 6, the customer went to the salon at 5:30 p.m., and the salon owner told her that her coat was ready and she could take it home with her. The customer inspected the coat and discovered that a button was missing. She told the salon owner that she would not accept the coat without the missing button. He informed her that the tailor had gone home for the day at 5 p.m. and would not be back at the salon until 8:30 a.m. on December 8, because Congress had enacted a law declaring December 7 to be Pearl Harbor Day, a new federal holiday, and the tailor had the day off. The salon owner assured the customer that the coat could be ready with the button sewn on by 9:15 a.m. on December 8. Which of the following best states the customer's position?
1381	Trease owned Hilltop in fee simple. By his will, he devised as follows: "Hilltop to such of my grandchildren who shall reach the age of_21; and by this provision I intend to include all grandchildren whenever born." At the time of his death, Trease had three children and two grandchildren. Courts hold such a devise valid under the common-law Rule Against Perpetuities. What is the best explanation of that determination?
1382	A landowner had a swimming pool and a dressing cabana constructed in her spacious backyard. The pool was entirely within the confines of the landowner's property. However, one corner of the cabana extended a few inches onto a far corner of her neighbor's land. At the time of the construction, neither the neighbor nor the landowner was aware that the cabana extended onto the neighbor's property. Does the neighbor have a cause of action for trespass?
1383	The Federal Computer Abuse Act establishes the Federal Computer Abuse Commission, authorizes the Commission to issue licenses for the possession of computers on terms that are consistent with the purposes of the act, and makes the unlicensed possession of a computer a crime. The provisions of the Federal Computer Abuse Act are inseverable. User applied to the Federal Computer Abuse Commission for a license to possess a computer. The Commission held, and User participated in, a trial-type proceeding on User's license application. In that proceeding it was demonstrated that User repeatedly and intentionally used computers to introduce secret destructive computer programs (computer viruses) into electronic data banks without the consent of their owners. As a result, the Commission denied User's application for a license. The license denial was based on a Commission rule authorized by the Computer Abuse Act that prohibited the issuance of computer licenses to persons who had engaged in such conduct. Nevertheless, User retained and continued to use his computer. He was subsequently convicted of the crime of unlicensed possession of a computer. On appeal, he challenges the constitutionality of the licensing provision of the Federal Computer Abuse Act. In this case, the reviewing court would probably hold that act to be
1384	Perkins and Morton were passengers sitting in adjoining seats on a flight on Delval Airline. There were many empty seats on the aircraft. During the flight, a flight attendant served Morton nine drinks. As Morton became more and more obviously intoxicated and attempted to engage Perkins in a conversation, Perkins chose to ignore Morton. This angered Morton, who suddenly struck Perkins in the face, giving her a black eye. If Perkins asserts a claim for damages against Delval Airline based on negligence, Perkins will
1385	A police officer learned from a reliable informant that a major drug deal was about to take place at a local restaurant. The officer obtained a search warrant for the restaurant and arrived with other uniformed officers to search the premises. While conducting the search, the officer searched several of the customers. While searching one of the restaurant's regular customers, the officer felt an object in the customer's pocket and pulled out a container filled with heroin. The customer was arrested and later convicted of possession of heroin. A state statute permits officers executing a search warrant to search persons on the premises if the officers reasonably expect danger to themselves or a risk of disposal or concealment of anything described in the warrant. If the customer appeals his conviction to the United States Supreme Court, the Court will most likely rule that:
1386	A passenger suffered a broken arm from an automobile accident caused by his driver's negligence in running through a red light. The passenger was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital for treatment. There, the emergency room physician negligently reset the bone in the passenger's arm. As a result, the passenger never recovered full use of his arm and his earnings as a carpenter were permanently reduced. The jurisdiction retains traditional contribution rules based on equal shares in cases applying joint and several liability. If the passenger brings suit against the driver for the damage to his arm, the passenger will recover:
1387	The defendant wanted to borrow his neighbor's car to go shopping for lawnmowers. Knowing that the neighbor was out of town for the weekend, the defendant opened the neighbor's garage door and took a car key that the neighbor hid in an old coffee can for emergencies. Once inside, the defendant, mistakenly believing that larceny applied only to the taking of items valued at over $100, decided to take the neighbor's lawnmower (worth $75) in order to trade it in on a new mower. However, on the way to the store with the mower, he was involved in an automobile accident, totaling the car. In a common law jurisdiction, the defendant is guilty of larceny of:
1388	On May I Ohner telegraphed Byer, "Will sell you any or all of the lots in Grove subdivision at $5,000 each. Details follow in letter." The letter contained all the necessary details concerning terms of payment, insurance, mortgages, etc., and provided, "This offer remains open until June I." On May 2, after he had received the telegram but before he had received the letter, Byer telegraphed Ohner, " Accept your offer with respect to lot 101." Both parties knew that there were fifty lots in the Grove subdivision and that they were numbered 101 through 150. For this question only, assume that Ohner and Byer were bound by a contract for the sale of lot 101 for $5,000, that on May 3 Ohner telephoned Byer that because he had just discovered that a shopping center was going to be erected adjacent to the Grove subdivision, he would "have to have $6,000 for each of the lots including lot 101," that Byer thereupon agreed to pay him $6,000 for lot 101, and that on May 6 Byer telegraphed, "Accept your offer with respect to the rest of the lots." Assuming that two contracts were formed and that there is no controlling statute, Byer will most likely be required to pay
1389	On March 1, Mechanic agreed to repair Ohner's machine for $5,000, to be paid on completion of the work. On March 15, before the work was completed, Mechanic sent a letter to Ohner with a copy to Jones, telling Ohner to pay the $5,000 to Jones, who was one of Mechanic's creditors, Mechanic then completed the work. Which of the following, if true, would best serve Ohner as a defense in an action brought against him by Jones for $5,000 ?
1390	Jack, a bank teller, was fired by Morgan, the president of the bank. Jack decided to take revenge against Morgan, but decided against attempting it personally, because he knew Morgan was protected around the clock by bank security guards. Jack knew that Chip had a violent temper and was very jealous. Jack falsely told Chip that Chip's wife, Elsie, was having an affair with Morgan. Enraged, Chip said, "What am I going to do?" Jack said, "If it were my wife, I'd just march into his office and blow his brains out." Chip grabbed a revolver and rushed to the bank. He walked into the bank, carrying the gun in his hand. One of the security guards, believing a holdup was about to occur, shot and killed Chip. If charged with attempted murder of Morgan, Jack should be found
1391	The State of Yuma provides by statute, ''No person may be awarded any state construction contract without agreeing to employ only citizens of the state and of the United States in performance of the contract.' Suppose the state supreme court declares the statute to be unconstitutional on the grounds that it violates the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal constitution and the equal protection clause of the state constitution. If the state seeks review in the United States Supreme Court, which of the following statements is most accurate?
1392	Perry suffered a serious injury while participating in an impromptu basketball game at a public park. The injury occurred when Perry and Dever, on opposing teams, each tried to obtain possession of the ball when it rebounded from the backboard after a missed shot at the basket. During that encounter, Perry was struck and injured by Dever's elbow. Perry now seeks compensation from Dever. At the trial, evidence was introduced tending to prove that the game had been rough from the beginning, that elbows and knees had frequently been used to discourage interference by opposing players, and that Perry had been one of those making liberal use of such tactics. In this action, will Perry prevail?
1393	A borrower owed a lender $1,000. The debtor had promised to pay the lender back in one week, but three months passed and no money was forthcoming. The debtor always managed to avoid the lender's calls, so the lender drove to the debtor's house one night, intending to demand repayment in person. The lender rang the debtor's doorbell, knocked on his door, and screamed for the debtor to come out, but no one responded. The lender then tried the doorknob on the closed front door. To her surprise the door was unlocked, and she entered the debtor's house. After yelling several times for the debtor, the lender concluded that the debtor was not at home. Convinced that the debtor had run out the back door to avoid her, the lender went to the debtor's living room, grabbed an overstuffed chair, and carried it to the debtor's front lawn. The lender then doused the chair with lighter fluid and set it afire. Alarmed at the flaming chair, one of the debtor's neighbors called the police. The police found the lender still standing on the lawn next to the smoldering chair. Assuming that the jurisdiction has not statutorily amended the common law elements of the crimes below, with which of the following may the lender be properly charged?
1394	An orchard and grocer had a written contract providing that the orchard would supply the grocer with a specified amount of apples and apple cider during the fall season. During the summer, the orchard's apple trees were damaged by apple blight that diminished the fall apple yield. Subsequently, the orchard assigned the contract to another orchard without notifying the grocer. The grocer discovered the substitution after he had received two deliveries of apples and cider, but said nothing. After the assignee orchard made a third delivery, it failed to make the last two deliveries called for in the contract between the grocer and the first orchard. The grocer:
1395	Questions 3-4 are based on the following statute. VEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER. Whoever in the course of driving a motor vehicle as defined in the Vehicle Code is criminally negligent in driving such vehicle or omits to do anything that is his duty to do and shows a wanton and reckless disregard for the safety of other persons and as a result of such act or omission causes the death of a human being is guilty of vehicular manslaughter. Vehicular manslaughter is punishable by a sentence of not more than 10 years in the state prison or not more than one year in the county jail. Defendant, driving along at a reasonable rate of speed, was distracted by a child carrying a silver balloon. He went through a boulevard stop light and hit and killed a pedestrian. He is charged with vehicular manslaughter. Of the following proposed definitions of criminal negligence, which is most favorable to the defendant?
1396	Oscar, the owner in fee simple, laid out a subdivision of 325 lots on 150 acres of land. He obtained governmental approval (as required by applicable ordinances) and, between 1968 and 1970, he sold 140 of the lots, inserting in each of the 140 deeds the following provision: "The Grantee, for himself and his heirs, assigns and successors, covenants and agrees that the premises conveyed herein shall have erected thereon one single-family dwelling and that no other structure (other than a detached garage normally incident to a single-family dwelling) shall be erected or maintained; and, further, that no use shall ever be made or permitted to be made than occupancy by a single family for residential purposes only." Because of difficulty encountered in selling the remaining lots for single family use, in January, 1971, Oscar advertised the remaining lots with prom inent emphasis: " These lots are not subject to any restrictions and purchasers will find them adaptable to a wide range of uses." Payne had purchased one of the 140 lots and brought suit against Oscar to establish that the remaining 185 lots, as well as the 140 sold previously, can be used only for residential purposes by single families. Assuming that procedural requirements have been met to permit adjudication of the issue Payne has tendered, which of the following is the most appropriate comment?
1397	A wife suffered from a particularly virulent form of cancer, and had lapsed into a nearly comatose state. Because the doctors had indicated that any treatment they could prescribe would be of little value, her husband decided to administer various poisons to his wife, thinking that they might stimulate her natural body defenses, or kill the cancer cells, resulting in her recovery. He tried doses of many different types of poison. Despite his ministrations, his wife died three days later. An autopsy performed by the county coroner established the cause of death as cancer. If the husband is prosecuted for the murder of his wife, the best reason why he would be acquitted is that:
1398	Peters sued Davis for $100,000 for injuries received in a traffic accident. Davis charges Peters with contributory negligence and alleges that Peters failed to have his lights on at a time when it was dark enough to require them. Davis calls Bystander to testify that Passenger, who was riding in Peters' automobile and who also was injured, confided to him at the scene of the accident that "we should have had our lights on." Bystander's testimony is
1399	On October 1, Toy Store, Inc., entered into a written contract with Fido Factory, Inc., for the purchase at $20 per unit of 1,000 mechanical dogs, to be specially manufactured by Fido according to Toy Store's specifications. Fido promised to deliver all of the dogs "not later than November 15, for the Yule shopping season," and Toy Store promised to pay the full $20,000 price upon delivery. In order to obtain operating funds, Fido as borrower entered into a written loan agreement on October 5 with the High Finance Company. In relevant part, this agreement recited, "Fido Factory hereby transfers and assigns to High Finance its (Fido Factory's) October 1 mechanical dog contract with Toy Store, as security for a 50-day loan of $15,000, the advance and receipt of which are hereby acknowledged by Fido Factory." No copy of this agreement, or statement relating to it, was filed in an office of public record. On October 15, Fido notified Toy Store, "We regret to advise that our master shaft burned out last night because our night supervisor let the lubricant level get too low. We have just fired the supervisor, but the shaft cannot be repaired or replaced until about January 1. We can guarantee delivery of your order, however, not later than January 20." Toy Store rejected this proposal as unacceptable and immediately contracted with the only other available manufacturer to obtain the 1,000 dogs at $30 per unit by November 15. For this question only, assume that by November 16, Fido, without legal excuse, has delivered no dogs, and that Toy Store has brought an action against Fido. In an action brought on November 16 by Toy Store against High Finance Company on account of Fido's default, Toy Store can recover
1400	A hunter saw what he thought to be a deer in a copse of trees. To approach the trees, the hunter had to climb over a fence posted with "no hunting" and "no trespassing" signs. He stalked the deer, fired, and discovered to his chagrin that he had just shot a large bull. The owner of the property, a rancher, heard the shot and grabbed his shotgun, fearing that hunters had shot another one of his cattle. When he arrived at the copse of trees and discovered that the hunter had killed his prize bull, he became enraged and ordered the hunter to get off his property in extremely abusive language. Instead of leaving immediately, the hunter said, "It's just a damn cow!" The rancher raised his shotgun and fired at the hunter, narrowly missing him. When the rancher operated the pump-action of the shotgun and raised it again, the hunter shot and killed him. In the hunter's prosecution for murder, he should be found:
1401	Dickinson was charged with possession of cocaine. At Dickinson's trial, the prosecution established that, when approached by police on a suburban residential street corner, Dickinson dropped a plastic bag and ran, and that when the police returned to the corner a few minutes later after catching Dickinson, they found a plastic bag containing white powder. Dickinson objects to introduction of this bag (the contents of which would later be established to be cocaine), citing lack of adequate identification. The objection should be\
1402	A plaintiff sued a chimney sweeping company for personal injury and property damages resulting from an explosion in her chimney the evening after the company had cleaned it. The explosion, which occurred when the plaintiff lit a fire in the fireplace, caused minor damage to the chimney, roof, and to the plaintiff, who was hit by falling bricks. As evidence that she assumed the risk of injury, the company offers to have its foreman testify that he had told the plaintiff not to use the fireplace for 24 hours to allow certain chemicals to evaporate. Is the foreman's proposed testimony hearsay?
1403	A homeowner and a builder entered into a written contract to build a sauna in a spare room in the homeowner's home at a cost of $3,000. The contract contained a clause stating that the builder will not begin construction without prior approval of the plans by the homeowner's certified public accountant. The builder submitted his designs to both the homeowner and the accountant. The homeowner liked the plans, but the accountant did not and withheld his approval. The builder asked the homeowner whether she wanted him to submit new designs. The homeowner told the builder orally, "No! Your designs are great! My accountant is crazy! You go right ahead and construct the sauna." The builder constructed the sauna. The homeowner now refuses to pay the builder, citing the clause requiring approval by the accountant. If the builder sues the homeowner, the builder will recover:
1404	Duffer and Slicker, who lived in different suburbs twenty miles apart, were golfing acquaintances at the Interurban Country Club. Both were traveling salesmen-Duffer for a pharmaceutical house and Slicker for a widget manufacturer. Duffer wrote Slicker by United States mail on Friday, October 8: I need a motorcycle for transportation to the country club, and will buy your Sujocki for $1,200 upon your bringing it to my home address above [stated in the letterhead] on or beforenoon, November 12 next. This offer is not subject to countermand. Sincerely, [signed] Duffer Slicker replied by mail the following day: I accept your offer, and promise to deliver the bike as you specified. Sincerely, [signed] Slicker This letter, although properly addressed, was misdirected by the postal service and not received by Duffer until November 10. Duffer had bought another Sujocki bike from Koolcat for $1,050 a few hours before. Koolcat saw Slicker at the Interurban Country Club on November I I and said: " I sold my Sujocki to Duffer yesterday for $1,050. Would you consider selling me yours for $950?" Slicker replied: "I'll let you know in a few days." On November 12, Slicker took his Sujocki to Duffer's residence; he arrived at 11:55 a.m. Duffer was asleep and did not answer Slicker's doorbell rings until 12:15 p.m. Duffer than rejected Slicker's bike on the ground that he had already bought Koolcat's. What is the probable legal effect of Koolcat's conversation with Slicker and report that he (Koolcat) had sold his Sujocki to Duffer on November 10?
1405	An owner of a rental property that generated steady income properly executed a will devising the property: "To my trustee in trust to pay the educational expenses of my children, but if any of them do not graduate from the state university by the age of 30, then for the benefit of the state university's scholarship fund for local town residents." When the owner died, he had three young children, all under the age of five. The jurisdiction in which the parties and property are located retains the common law Rule Against Perpetuities. Is the gift in trust to the state university valid?
1406	Householder hired Contractor to remodel her. Householders, kitchen. She had learned of him through a classified advertisement he placed in the local newspaper. During the telephone conversation in which she hired him, he stated he was experienced and qualified to do all necessary work. Because of his low charge for his work, they agreed in writing that on acceptance of his job by Householder, he would have no further liability to her or to anyone else for any defects in materials or workmanship, and that she would bearall such costs. Householder purchased a dishwasher manufactured by Elex Company from Dealer, who was in the retail electrical appliance business. The washer was sold by Dealer with only the manufacturer's warranty and with no warranty by Dealer: Elex Company restricted its warranty to ninety days on parts and labor. Contractor installed the dishwasher. Two months after Householder accepted the entire job. she was conversing in her home with Accountant, an acquaintance who had agreed to prepare her income tax return gratuitously . As they talked, they noticed that the dishwasher was operating strangely, repeatedly stopping and starting. At Householder's request. Accountant gave it a cursory examination and, while inspecting it. received a violent electrical shock which did him extensive harm. The dishwasher had an internal wiring defect which allowed electrical current to be carried into the framework and caused the machine to malfunction. The machine had not been adequately grounded by Contractor during installation; if it had been, the current would have been led harmlessly away. The machine carried instructions for correct grounding, which Contractor had not followed. If Accountant asserts a claim based on strict liability against Elex Company for damages, the probable result is that Accountant will
1407	Three months ago, Bert agreed in writing to buy Sam's single-family residence, Liveacre, for $110,000. Bert paid Sam a $5,000 deposit to be applied to the purchase price. The contract stated that Sam had the right at his option to retain the deposit as liquidated damages in the event of Bert's default. The closing was to have taken place last week. Six weeks ago, Bert was notified by his employer that he was to be transferred to another job 1,000 miles away. Bert immediately notified Sam that he could not close, and therefore he demanded the return of his $5,000. Sam refused, waited until after the contract closing date, listed with a broker, and then conveyed Liveacre for $108,000 to Conner, a purchaser found by the real estate broker. Conner paid the full purchase price and immediately recorded his deed. Conner knew of the prior contract with Bert. In an appropriate action, Bert seeks to recover the $5,000 deposit from Sam. The most probable result will be that Sam
1408	To satisfy customer demand for ketchup from organically grown tomatoes, a major restaurant chain agrees to give its ketchup manufacturer a $4 million upfront investment in exchange for the manufacturer's switching all of its current tomato farming techniques to satisfy organic standards. The contract further states that the restaurant chain will then be able to purchase all its needs for organic ketchup from the ketchup manufacturer at a certain price. Soon after entering into this contract, the ketchup manufacturer, without the restaurant chain's knowledge or assent, sold all its tomato farms, but not its manufacturing plants, to a large agricultural corporation. Under the terms of this sale, the agricultural corporation agreed to sell to the tomato grower all tomatoes grown on the land for 20 years. The agricultural corporation's employees have no experience in organic farming, and the agricultural corporation has no reputation in the farming industry as a successful tomato producer. The restaurant chain-ketchup manufacturer contract was silent on the matter of the ketchup manufacturer's selling any or all of its business assets. If the restaurant chain seeks an appropriate judicial remedy against the ketchup manufacturer for selling its tomato farms, is the restaurant chain likely to prevail?
1409	Pauline, an unmarried female, was prominent in the women's liberation movement. She recently gave birth to a baby and publicly announced that she had no intention of marrying the father or disclosing his identity. The local newspaper, Journal, decided to do a series of articles on Pauline, entitled "The Perils of Pauline." The first article about Pauline discussed her parents. The article correctly stated that Mary, her mother, had died recently and Frank, her father, is still living. The article referred to the fact that at the time of Pauline's birth there were rumors that she had been born six months after the marriage of Mary and Frank, that Frank was not in fact her father, and that a person identified as Albert, who had played minor roles in two motion pictures, was her real father. Albert has lived in retirement for the last ten years. If Pauline asserts a claim based on invasion of privacy againstJournal for the statements in the first article about her birth and it is established that the statements are true, the most likely result is that Pauline will
1410	Congress passed a bill prohibiting the President from granting a pardon to any person who had not served at least one-third of the sentence imposed by the court which convicted that person. The President vetoed the bill, claiming that it was unconstitutional. Nevertheless, Congress passed it over his veto by a two-thirds vote of each house. This act of Congress is
1411	A man and a woman met in a bar. The woman told the man that she greatly admired the diamond stickpin he had in his lapel. "Oh, this," the man laughed. "It's no diamond; it's only a piece of glass." The woman acknowledged his statement, but kept commenting on how nice it looked. After further conversation, the man orally agreed to sell the stickpin to her for $510. They agreed that in two days, he would bring the stickpin to the same bar, and the woman would bring the $510 in cash. The man duly appeared with the pin, but the woman failed to appear. The man filed suit against the woman for $510. The woman's best defense is:
1412	Jones, a marijuana farmer, had been missing for several months. The sheriffs department received an anonymous tip that Miller, a rival marijuana farmer, had buried Jones in a hillside about 200 yards from Miller's farmhouse. Sheriffs deputies went to Miller's farm. They cut the barbed wire that surrounded the hillside and entered, looking for the grave. They also searched the adjacent fields on Miller's farm that were within the area enclosed by the barbed wire and discovered clothing that belonged to Jones hanging on a scarecrow. Miller observed their discovery and began shooting. The deputies returned the fire. Miller dashed to his pickup truck to escape. Unable to start the truck, he fled across a field toward the barn. A deputy tackled him just as he entered the barn. As Miller attempted to get up, the deputy pinned his arms behind his back. Another deputy threatened, "Tell us what you did with Jones or we will shut you down and see your family on relief." Miller responded that he had killed Jones in a fight but did not report the incident because he did not want authorities to enter his land and discover his marijuana crop. Instead, he buried him behind the barn. Miller was thereafter charged with murder. If Miller moves to exclude the introduction of Jones's clothing into evidence, the court should
1413	Congress passed a statute that established a five-member commission to investigate issues relating to gun control and to make recommendations to Congress for new gun control laws. All five members of the commission were appointed by Congress. An entity that has organizational standing brings a suit to enjoin the commission from investigating and recommending new gun control laws to Congress. The appropriate decision for the court is to:
1414	A landowner owned a large piece of property containing an inn and a bakery. She entered into a contract to sell the property to a purchaser for $1 million. The contract was recorded. The purchaser gave the landowner $200,000 as earnest money. The closing date was set for September 10, two months after the signing of the contract. On August 10, an arsonist set fire to the inn, which burned to the ground. On September 10, the landowner appeared at the closing and tendered the deed to the property. The buyer refused to tender the remaining $800,000 of the purchase price and demanded the return of his earnest money. The landowner sued the buyer for specific performance of the contract. The buyer countersued for the return of his earnest money. Both parties stipulate that the value of the property without the inn is $600,000. At trial, the landowner will most likely:
1415	A written construction contract, under which Contractor agreed to build a new house for Owner at a fixed price of $200,000, contained the following provision: Prior to construction or during the course thereof, this contract may be modified by mutual agreement of the parties as to "extras" or other departures from the plans and specifications provided by Owner and attached hereto. Such modifications, however, may be authorized only in writing, signed by both parties. During construction, Contractor incorporated into the structure overhanging gargoyles and other "extras" orally requested by Owner for orally agreed prices in addition to the contract price. Owner subsequently refused to pay anything for such extras, aggregating $30,000 at the agreed prices, solely on the ground that no written, signed authorization for them was ever effected. If Contractor sues Owner on account of the "extras," which, if any, of the following will effectively support Owner's defense? I. The parol evidence rule. II. The preexisting duty rule. III. Failure of an express condition. IV. The statute of frauds.
1416	The defendant was on trial for statutory rape. He denied that the alleged victim was even in his presence on the night of the alleged offense, when he was working as the night clerk at a convenience store. The prosecution offers to have a witness testify that, in a phone conversation on the evening in question, the victim, who is available to testify at the trial, said that she had to leave because the defendant wanted her to stop by the store while he was working. The defense objects to the proposed testimony. Should the court allow the witness's testimony?
1417	A builder and a landowner entered into a valid written contract under which the builder agreed to erect a house on the landowner's land according to certain plans and specifications and the landowner agreed to pay the sum of $200,000 upon completion. During the course of construction, building costs increased significantly. The builder informed the landowner of the increased costs, and the parties agreed in writing that the builder could omit installing the air conditioning unit called for by the specifications (thus saving the builder approximately $10,000) and nevertheless receive the full construction contract price. Under the general rule, this subsequent written agreement is:
1418	A state statute defines all murders as second degree murders unless deliberation and premeditation can be shown, in which case the crime is elevated to first degree murder. Manslaughter is defined as at common law. The defendant, just having been served with divorce papers, decided to drown his sorrows at the local pub. After drinking heavily and becoming very intoxicated, the defendant became enraged when another patron spilled a drink on him. He took a nearby ashtray and smashed it over the patron's head, killing him instantly. The crimes below are listed in descending order of seriousness. What is the most serious crime of which the defendant would be convicted?
1419	A state statute makes fraud for personal financial gain a crime. Jones was convicted of violating this statute on three separate occasions. Following his most recent conviction, he professed to have undergone a religious conversion and proclaimed himself to be the divine minister of "St. Rockport," an alleged messiah who would shortly be making his appearance on earth. Jones solicited cash donations from the public to support his efforts to spread the word of St. Rockport and his coming appearance on earth. Following complaints by several contributors who claimed he defrauded them, Jones was again charged with fraud under this state statute. The charge was that Jones "should have known that his representations about St. Rockport were false and, therefore, that he made them solely to collect cash donations for his personal gain." A witness for the prosecution in Jones's trial stated that Jones had admitted that, at times, he had doubts about the existence of St. Rockport. Jones was the only religious minister prosecuted for fraud under this state statute. The strongest constitutional defense that Jones could assert would be that this prosecution
1420	Motorco is a manufacturer of motor vehicles. A federal regulation requires that all motor vehicles manufactured for sale in the United States be equipped with seat belts for each passenger and prescribes specifications for such belts. Motorco equipped all its cars with seat belts. It purchased all the bolts used in its seat belt assemblies from Boltco and it tested samples from each shipment received. Dunn purchased a motor vehicle manufactured by Motorco. While operating the car, with Price as a passenger in the front seat, Dunn collided with another vehicle. The collision was due solely to Dunn's negligence. Price had his seat belt fastened, but one of the bolts which anchored the belt to the frame broke. Price was thrown through the windshield, sustaining various injuries. Dunn, whose belt was fastened and held, was killed when, following the collision, the car went off the road, down an embankment, and overturned. Subsequent to the accident, tests of the bolt that broke showed metallurgical defects. Motorco's records showed that tests of samples from the shipment in which the defective bolt was received revealed no defective bolts. In a negligence action by Price against Motorco, the proof needed to establish a prima facie case is
1421	On December 1, Broker contracted with Collecta to sell her one of a certain type of rare coin for $12,000, delivery and payment to occur on the next March 1. To fulfill that contract, and without Collecta's knowledge, Broker contracted on January 1 to purchase for $10,000 a specimen of that type coin from Hoarder, delivery and payment to occur on February 1. The market price of such coins had unexpectedly fallen to $8,000 by February 1, when Hoarder tendered the coin and Broker repudiated. On February 25, the market in such coins suddenly reversed and had stabilized at $12,000 on March 1. Broker, however, had failed to obtain a specimen of the coin and repudiated his agreement with Collecta when she tendered the $12,000 agreed price on March 1. Later that day, after learning by chance of Broker's dealing with Collecta, Hoarder telephoned Collecta and said: "Listen, Broker probably owes me at least $2,000 in damages for refusing wrongfully to buy my coin for $10,000 on February 1 when the market was down to $8,000. But I'm in good shape in view of the market's recovery since then, and I think you ought to get after the so-and-so." If Collecta immediately sues Broker for his breach of the Broker-Hoarder contract, which of the following will the court probably decide?
1422	A woman whose child attended a charter school learned that the children of the woman's neighbor who attended a parochial school received a hot lunch paid for, in part, through federal expenditures enacted under Congress's spending power. The charter school received no funding from the federal government. The woman challenged this federal expenditure as a violation of the Establishment Clause. For her to bring the suit, at the very least the woman must allege that:
1423	A homeowner heard a loud bang against the bay window one evening. He looked out the window and saw a 12-year-old boy from the neighborhood packing a large snowball. Fearful that he would break the window with another throw, the homeowner went outside and said, "Come here, I want to talk to you." The boy ran in the other direction and jumped over the fence belonging to a neighbor. Because it was dark, the boy landed on a birdbath and knocked it over, breaking it. The neighbor brought an action against the homeowner for trespass. If the homeowner prevails, it will most likely be because:
1424	A plaintiff sued his neighbor over a 10-foothigh stockade fence that the neighbor was building adjacent to the plaintiff's backyard. The local zoning ordinance permitted a fence of this height unless it was a "spite fence," defined as a fence erected solely for the purpose of interfering with neighboring landowners' use and enjoyment of their property. The plaintiff alleged that the neighbor was building the fence to block sunlight to the garden that the plaintiff had planted. The neighbor denied that she was building the fence for that purpose. The plaintiff wishes to introduce evidence that the neighbor had sprayed herbicide towards the garden previously. Should the judge permit the plaintiff's testimony?
1425	To keep election costs manageable, a state law required a candidate in a general election to collect on a petition supporting her candidacy the signatures of at least 4% of the voters eligible to vote for the office for which the candidate was running. Studies revealed that, prior to adoption of the law, a candidate who did not have at least 4% of the voters supporting her initially had never won an election. An independent candidate for governor who had limited campaign resources was supported in the polls by 30% of the voters, but had been able to obtain only 3.5% of the eligible voters' signatures by the filing deadline. The board of elections refused to put her name on the ballot. If the candidate sues to have her name placed on the ballot, claiming that the state's petition requirements are unconstitutional, which of the following statements is most accurate?
1426	On May 1, Selco and Byco entered into a written agreement in which Selco agreed to fabricate and sell to Byco 10,000 specially designed brake linings for a new type of power brake manufactured by Byco. The contract provided that Byco would pay half of the purchase price on May 15 in order to give Selco funds to "tool up" for the work; that Selco would deliver 5,000 brake linings on May 31; that Byco would pay the balance of the purchase price on June 15; and that Selco would deliver the balance of the brake linings on June 30. On May 10, Selco notified Byco that it was doubtful whether Selco could perform because of problems encountered in modifying its production machines to produce the brake linings. On May 15, however, Selco assured Byco that the production difficulties had been overcome, and Byco paid Selco the first 50 percent installment of the purchase price. Selco did not deliver the first 5,000 brake linings on May 31, or at any time thereafter; and on June 10, Selco notified Byco that it would not perform the contract. Which of the following correctly states Byco's rights and obligations immediately after receipt of Selco's notice on May 10?
1427	A plaintiff filed suit against a defendant, asserting that his German shepherd dog had bitten her without provocation. The defendant denied that his dog bit the plaintiff. At the trial, the plaintiff's attorney called the plaintiff to the stand. After asking her name and address, he asked only one further question: "Were you bitten by a German shepherd dog with a white forepaw?" The plaintiff replied in the affirmative and was dismissed from the stand. The plaintiff's attorney then called the defendant to the stand as an adverse witness. After ascertaining his name and address, the attorney asked only one question: "Do you own a German shepherd dog with a white forepaw?" Upon receiving an affirmative answer, the plaintiff's attorney rested. The defense attorney rose to crossexamine the defendant. Her first question was, "Has your German shepherd dog ever displayed anything other than a gentle disposition?" The plaintiff's attorney immediately objected to the question. What would be the most likely ruling of the court on the objection?
1428	Believing that state law made it illegal to purchase a certain drug without providing identification and signing a log book, a defendant purchased the drug without doing so. Unbeknownst to the defendant, the state legislature had repealed the statute, and the drug could be legally purchased without providing identification or a signature. May the defendant be charged with attempting an illegal purchase of drugs?
1429	Storekeeper, the owner of a large hardware store, sells power saws for both personal and commercial use. He often takes old power saws as trade-ins on new ones. The old power saws are then completely disassembled and rebuilt with new bearings by Storekeeper's employees and sold by Storekeeper as "reconditioned saws. " Purchaser, the owner and operator of a cabinetmaking shop, informed Storekeeper that he wanted to buy a reconditioned circular saw for use in his cabinetmaking business. However, the blade that was on the saw he picked out had very coarse teeth for cutting rough lumber. Purchaser told Storekeeper that he wanted a saw blade that would cut plywood. Storekeeper exchanged the coarse blade for a new one with finer teeth that would cut plywood smoothly. The new blade was manufactured by Saw- Blade Company, which uses all available techniques to inspect its products for defects. The reconditioned saw had been manufactured by Power Saw Company. The week after the saw was purchased, Employee, who works for Purchaser in Purchaser's cabinetmaking shop, was injured while using the saw. Employee's arm was severely cut. As a result, the cabinetmaking shop was shut down for a week until a replacement for Employee could be found. If Employee was cutting a sheet of hard plastic, and while he was doing so, the saw blade flew to pieces and severely cut Employee's arm, and if Employee asserts a claim based on strict liability in tort against Saw-Blade Company, the defense most likely to prevail is
1430	A state statute forbids employers from discriminating on the basis of religion; however, an exception provides that established religions that employ persons to engage in nonprofit activities may be exempted from this rule. A new church was formed in the state. The church espoused a number of nontraditional views. When the church gained enough members to open a meeting place, it advertised for clerical and maintenance workers. The plaintiff applied for a position and was told that she would be hired if she converted to the church's religion. The plaintiff refused to do so and complained to the state human relations board. After investigating, the board concluded that the church was not an established religion and its beliefs were not plausible. It ruled that the religious exemption would not be applicable and ordered the church to hire the plaintiff. Church officials filed an action in federal district court challenging the board's refusal to apply the exemption. How is the court likely to rule?
1431	A victim was struck by a car in a hit-and-run accident. A police officer arrived half an hour after the accident. The victim was in shock and came in and out of consciousness. As the officer applied first aid, the victim muttered, "I know I'm going to die. Oh my, he ran the light!" The victim fell back into unconsciousness, but revived again and muttered, "Why didn't he stop?" The officer heard the comments clearly and made a note of them. Good police work by the officer and others led to the discovery of the driver of the car that struck the victim. The victim survived and filed a tort action against the driver. Before the case came to trial, the victim died of a heart attack. The causes of the heart attack were totally unrelated to the accident. The laws of the jurisdiction allow for survival of personal injury actions. Thus, the victim's estate is substituted for the victim as plaintiff. If the plaintiff's attorney seeks to have the officer testify to the victim's statements at the time of the accident, how will the court rule?
1432	Gourmet purchased the front portion of the land needed for a restaurant he desired to build and operate, but the back portion was the subject of a will dispute between Hope and Faith (two sisters). Hope's attorney advised her that her claim was doubtful. Gourmet, knowing only that the unresolved dispute existed, agreed in a signed writing to pay Hope $6,000, payable $1,000 annually, in exchange for a quitclaim deed (a deed containing no warranties) from Hope, who promptly executed such a deed to Gourmet and received Gourmet's first annual payment. Shortly thereafter, the probate court handed down a decision in Faith's favor, ruling that Hope had no interest in the land. This decision has become final. Gourmet subsequently defaulted when his second annual installment came due. In an action against Gourmet for breach of contract, Hope will probably
1433	Congress recently enacted a statute imposing severe criminal penalties on anyone engaged in trading in the stock market who, in the course of that trading, takes "unfair advantage" of other investors who are also trading in the stock market. The statute does not define the term "unfair advantage." There have been no prosecutions under this new statute. The members of an association of law school professors that is dedicated to increasing the clarity of the language used in criminal statutes believe that this statute is unconstitutionally vague. Neither the association nor any of its members is currently engaged in, or intends in the future to engage in, trading in the stock market. The association and its members bring suit against the Attorney General of the United States in a federal district court, seeking an injunction against the enforcement of this statute on the ground that it is unconstitutional. May the federal court determine the merits of this suit?
1434	To combat rising unemployment, a state offered a $25,000 prize to anyone who could devise a scheme to create at least 200 jobs within the state and demonstrate its viability. While hiking through a national park within the state, a geologist noticed rock containing titanium. Knowing that titanium was commonly used in military aircraft built within the state and that mining and refining titanium could provide the state with thousands of jobs, the geologist chipped out a sample of the ore and took it back to the state employment division. After reviewing the geologist's ideas, the state announced in a press release that he was the first recipient of the $25,000 prize. Within a few days, the federal ranger in charge of the valley from which the sample was taken had the geologist arrested for violating a federal law making it illegal to remove any "plants, animals, or minerals from federal lands." The geologist was convicted and fined $5,000. He appeals the conviction to the federal court of appeals, claiming that the fine is unconstitutional. How should the court rule?
1435	As part of a new environmental policy, a state legislature enacted a statute creating a farmland development agency. The agency was organized along the lines of a private corporation. The agency's purpose was to restore and cultivate polluted land in the state, making the land suitable for farmers. Once the agency cultivated the land, it would sell the land to new farmers at a reduced price. The agency began cultivating and selling farmland in one county where the pollution levels were high, but did not operate in a neighboring county with slightly lower pollution levels. A group of residents in the second county bring an action in federal court against the agency director, seeking to compel the agency to begin operations in their county. What will be the probable outcome of this litigation?
1436	Steve, in desperate need of money, decided to hold up a local convenience store. Determined not to harm anyone, he carried a toy gun that resembled a real gun. In the store, he pointed the toy gun at the clerk and demanded money. A customer who entered the store and saw the robbery in progress pulled his own gun and fired at Steve. The bullet missed Steve but struck and killed the clerk. Steve was charged with felony murder. His best argument for being found NOT guilty is that he
1437	Plaintiff sued Defendant for illegal discrimination, claiming that Defendant fired him because of his race. At trial, Plaintiff called Witness, expecting him to testify that Defendant had admitted the racial motivation. Instead, Witness testified that Defendant said that he had fired Plaintiff because of his frequent absenteeism. While Witness is still on the stand, Plaintiff offers a properly authenticated secret tape recording he had made at a meeting with Witness in which Witness related Defendant's admissions of racial motivation. The tape recording is
1438	Questions 35-36 are based on the four case summaries below. For each question, select the case that would be most applicable as a precedent. Harris, a heroin addict, broke into a home and took several cameras and watches, which he promptly pawned to obtain cash with which to purchase a "fix." Harris was later charged with larceny of the cameras and watches.
1439	On January 1, Awl and Howser agreed in writing that Awl would build a house on Howser's lot according to Howser's plans and specifications for $60,000, the work to commence on April 1. Howser agreed to make an initial payment of $10,000 on April 1, and to pay the balance upon completion of the work. On February 1, Awl notified Howser that he (Awl) would lose money on the job at that price, and would not proceed with the work unless Howser would agree to increase the price to $90,000. Howser thereupon, without notifying Awl, agreed in writing with Gutter for Gutter, commencing April 1, to build the house for $75,000, which was the fair market cost of the work to be done. On April 1, both Awl and Gutter showed up at the building site to begin work, Awl telling Howser that he had decided to "take the loss" and would build the house for $60,000 as originally agreed. Howser dismissed Awl and allowed Gutter to begin work on the house. In a contract action by Awl against Howser, which of the following would the court decide under the prevailing American view?
1440	Cycle Company manufactured a bicycle that it sold to Bike Shop, a retail bicycle dealer, which in turn sold it to Roth. Shortly thereafter, while Roth was riding the bicycle along a city street, he saw a traffic light facing him turn from green to yellow. He sped up, hoping to cross the intersection before the light turned red. However, Roth quickly realized that he could not do so and applied the brake, which failed. To avoid the traffic that was then crossing in front of him, Roth turned sharply to his right and onto the sidewalk, where he struck Perez, a pedestrian. Both Perez and Roth sustained injuries. If Roth asserts a claim against Bike Shop based on strict liability in tort, will Roth prevail?
1441	A defendant was charged with the January 12 armed robbery of a grocery store in Texas. His defense is that he was not in Texas on the date of the armed robbery and thus he could not have committed the crime. To show that he was not in the area on January 12, the defendant wishes to introduce into evidence a letter he wrote to his sister stating, "I will see you in Vermont on January 12." The prosecution objects. The letter is:
1442	In an attempt to induce her niece to improve her grades, an aunt told her niece that she would give her $50 for every "A" she earned in law school. Inspired by the opportunity to earn extra spending money, the niece studied like never before and ended up earning three "A's" the following semester. Upon contacting her aunt with the news, the niece learned that her aunt was "only kidding" about paying her for every "A" earned in law school. If the aunt's offer to her niece was held to be valid, it would be an offer for:
1443	As part of the Domestic Security Act, Congress established a permanent commission to evaluate the security of federal government buildings located in the District of Columbia. The commission would have the authority to evaluate current security conditions, establish new security guidelines, and coordinate security procedures among various governmental agencies. The legislation provided that three members of the commission were to be appointed by the President, two members by a committee of the House of Representatives, and two members by the United States Supreme Court. The President had the authority to veto any of the selections to the commission made by the congressional committee or the Supreme Court. If a party with the requisite standing challenges the legislation and it is found unconstitutional, it will most likely be because:
1444	Central City in the state of Green is a center for businesses that assemble personal computers. Components for these computers are manufactured elsewhere in Green and in other states, then shipped to Central City, where the computers are assembled. An ordinance of Central City imposes a special license tax on all of the many companies engaged in the business of assembling computers in that city. The tax payable by each such company is a percentage of the company's gross receipts. The Green statute that authorizes municipalities to impose this license tax has a "Green content" provision. To comply with this provision of state law, the Central City license tax ordinance provides that the tax paid by any assembler of computers subject to this tax ordinance will be reduced by a percentage equal to the proportion of computer components manufactured in Green. Assembler is a company that assembles computers in Central City and sells them from its offices in Central City to buyers throughout the United States. All of the components of its computers come from outside the state of Green. Therefore, Assembler must pay the Central City license tax in full without receiving any refund. Other Central City computer assemblers use components manufactured in Green in varying proportions and, therefore, are entitled to partial reductions of their Central City license tax payments. Following prescribed procedure, Assembler brings an action in a proper court asking to have Central City's special license tax declared unconstitutional on the ground that it is inconsistent with the negative implications of the commerce clause. In this case, the court should rule
1445	Alan, who was already married, went through a marriage ceremony with Betty and committed bigamy. Carl, his friend, who did not know of Alan's previous marriage, had encouraged Alan to marry Betty and was best man at the ceremony, If Carl is charged with being an accessory to bigamy, he should be found
1446	Seventeen years ago, a lumberjack purchased Lot 1, which is adjacent to Lot 2 and Lot 3. A public road runs along the far side of Lots 2 and 3. At the time of the purchase, he asked the owner of Lot 2 to grant him an easement to use the paved way across Lot 2 to haul logs to the public road. The owner of Lot 2 agreed. The lumberjack paid nothing for the easement, and the deed granting the easement was properly recorded. For six months, the lumberjack hauled logs across Lot 2. The lumberjack then negotiated with the owner of Lot 3, and she granted him a license to haul logs on the gravel road across Lot 3 to the public road, a shorter distance than the route across Lot 2. The lumberjack paid the owner of Lot 3 a modest annual fee for this privilege. Since that time, the lumberjack has never used the paved way across Lot 2 for any purpose. Six months ago, the owner of Lot 2 conveyed the lot to a buyer, and two weeks ago, the buyer had a chain-link fence built around the perimeter of Lot 2, which blocked the lumberjack's access to the paved way crossing Lot 2. One week ago, acting within her rights, the owner of Lot 3 revoked the lumberjack's license to use the gravel road crossing Lot 3. The next day, the lumberjack demanded that the buyer of Lot 2 remove the chain-link fence because of the easement, but the buyer refused. The state has a 15-year prescription and adverse possession period. Which of the following best represents the lumberjack's rights under the circumstances?
1447	In a prosecution of Doris for murder, the government seeks to introduce a properly authenticated note written by the victim that reads: "Doris did it." In laying the foundation for admitting the note as a dying declaration, the prosecution offered an affidavit from the attending physician that the victim knew she was about to die when she wrote the note. The admissibility of the note as a dying declaration is
1448	Susan entered a guilty plea to a charge of embezzlement. Her attorney hired a retired probation officer as a consultant to gather information for the preparation of a sentencing plan for Susan that would avoid jail. For that purpose, the consultant interviewed Susan for three hours. Thereafter, the prosecution undertook an investigation of Susan's possible involvement in other acts of embezzlement. The consultant was subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury. The consultant refused to answer any questions concerning her conversation with Susan. The prosecution has moved for an order requiring her to answer those questions. The motion should be
1449	In a criminal trial, the prosecutor called a witness to the stand to authenticate the voice in a tape recording as the defendant's. The only other time the witness had heard the defendant's voice was after his arrest. Assuming a proper foundation has been laid, may the witness properly authenticate the defendant's voice?
1450	An owner of a 240-acre tract of land entered into an agreement to sell 20 acres of the land to his neighbor. The land the neighbor wanted was located in the northwest quarter of the land. The owner wrote out the following statement: The owner agrees to sell to the neighbor, for $50,000, 20 acres in the northwest quarter of the owner's land, the owner's land beginning at a point in the northeast quadrant of the county on the 16th county survey line, six minutes west of the 98th Meridian, and then proceeding due east 1,320 yards and from that point due south to the creek, and then westward along the creek to the point at which it intersects the public road, and then northward along the eastern edge of the public road until the road ends, and then due northward from that point to the original starting point of the survey. The owner had copied the language describing the land from his own deed. The owner then signed the paper and gave it to the neighbor. On the date set for closing, the neighbor tendered $50,000 to the owner. The owner refused to accept the money and refused to convey 20 acres to the neighbor. If the neighbor sues the owner for specific performance:
1451	After becoming intoxicated one evening, the defendant went to a used car lot to try to find a car that he could use to drive home. On discovering that none of the cars had keys in the ignition, he broke into the main office of the used car lot to get a key. As he left the office with a key, a security guard tried to apprehend the defendant. The defendant pushed the guard to the ground. The guard hit his head hard on the pavement and died. Relevant statutes extend burglary to include buildings not used as a dwelling. First degree murder is defined as "the premeditated and intentional killing of another or a killing committed during the commission of a rape, robbery, burglary, or arson." Second degree murder is defined as all murders that are not first degree murder. If the defendant is charged with first degree murder for the death of the security guard, the court should charge the jury on the issue of the defense of intoxication that:
1452	The police had, over time, accumulated reliable information that Jason operated a large cocaine- distribution network, that he and his accomplices often resorted to violence, and that they kept a small arsenal of weapons in his home. One day, the police received reliable information that a large brown suitcase with leather straps containing a supply of cocaine had been delivered to Jason's home and that it would be moved to a distribution point the next morning. The police obtained a valid search warrant to search for and seize the brown suitcase and the cocaine and went to Jason's house. The police knocked on Jason's door and called out, "Police. Open up. We have a search warrant." After a few seconds with no response, the police forced the door open and entered. Hearing noises in the basement, the police ran down there and found Jason with a large brown suitcase with leather straps. They seized the suitcase and put handcuffs on Jason. A search of his person revealed a switchblade knife and a .45-caliber pistol. Jason cursed the police and said, "You never would have caught me with the stuff if it hadn't been for that lousy snitch Harvey!" The police then fanned out through the house, looking in every room and closet. They found no one else, but one officer found an Uzi automatic weapon in a box on a closet shelf in Jason's bedroom. In addition to charges relating to the cocaine in the suitcase, Jason is charged with unlawful possession of weapons. Jason moves pretrial to suppress the use as evidence of the weapons seized by the police and of the statement he made. As to the switchblade knife and the .45-caliber pistol, Jason's motion to suppress should be
1453	Darlene was arrested on a murder charge. She was given Miranda warnings and refused to talk further with the police. At trial, she testified in her own defense. She recounted in some detail her whereabouts on the day of the ci ime and explained why she could not have committed the crime. On cross-examination and over defense objection, the prosecution emphasized the fact that she did not tell the police this story following her arrest. The prosecution thereby suggested that her testimony was false. Defendant was convicted. On appeal, she claims error in the prosecutor's cross-examination. Her conviction will most probably be
1454	The Prindles have lived in their residential neighborhood for many years. Delbrook moved into the house next door and brought with him six hives of bees, from which he gathers honey for his own use. It is not possible for Delbrook to confine the bees to his property, and the bees settle on the Prindles' flowers and bushes in such numbers that it is impossible for the Prindles to use their yard freely. The Prindles no longer enter their garden for fear of being stung by the bees. In a claim against Delbrook, will the Prindles prevail?
1455	John Doe, the owner of a milk container manufacturing firm, sought to focus public attention on the milk packaging law of the State of Clinton in order to have it repealed. On a weekday at 12:00 noon, he delivered an excited, animated, and loud harangue on the steps of the State Capitol in front of the main entryway. An audience of 200 onlookers, who gathered on the steps, heckled him and laughed as he delivered his tirade. Doe repeatedly stated, gesturing expressively and making faces, that "the g-ddamned milk packaging law is stupid," and that "I will strangle every one of those g-ddamned legislators I can get hold of because this law they created proves they are all too dumb to live." After about fifteen minutes, Doe stopped speaking, and the amused crowd dispersed. There are three relevant statutes of the State of Clinton. The first statute prohibits "all speech making, picketing, and public gatherings of every sort on the Capitol steps in front of the main entryway between 7:45 a.m. -8:15 a.m., 11:45 a.m. -12:15 p.m., 12:45 p.m. -1:15 p.m., and 4:45 p.m. -5:15 p.m., on Capitol working days." A second state statute punishes "any person who shall intentionally threaten the life or safety of any public official for any act which he performed as part of his public office." Which of the following statements is correct concerning the possible punishment of Doe under the second statute?
1456	A plaintiff brings a federal civil rights action against several members of a police department for near-fatal injuries incurred as a result of an alleged beating administered by the officers. The plaintiff plans to call as a witness his cellmate, who will testify that the plaintiff was in fact beaten by the defendants. The plaintiff also wants to introduce the bloodstained shirt that he wore on the night of the beating. The defendants plan to call an expert to testify that the injuries suffered by the plaintiff were inconsistent with injuries likely to be inflicted by the alleged police beating, and a second expert to testify similarly. The defendants also will call as a witness a fellow officer, who will testify that the defendant was suspected to have AIDS, and as a result the defendants would not have beaten him for fear of being infected by any open wounds. Which item of relevant evidence is the court least likely to exclude?
1457	After being fired from his job, Mel drank almost a quart of vodka and decided to ride the bus home. While on the bus, he saw a briefcase he mistakenly thought was his own, and began struggling with the passenger carrying the briefcase. Mel knocked the passenger to the floor, took the briefcase, and fled. Mel was arrested and charged with robbery. Mel should be
1458	A seller entered into an enforceable written agreement to sell her home to a buyer for $150,000. The agreement provided that escrow would close on March 31, and on that (late the seller would provide good and marketable title to the house, free and clear of all encumbrances. On March 10, the seller was notified by her insurance company that she had to renew her insurance policy by March 15. The seller immediately notified the company that she did not want the insurance renewed at that ti ime. Consequently, when the house was destroyed by fire on March 25, it was uninsured. On March 31, the buyer refused to close and the sdler immediately brought an action against him for specific performance. In this jurisdiction, which has no applicable statute to govern this situation, the most probable result of this action would be:
1459	Surgeon performed a sterilization operation on Patient. After the surgery, Surgeon performed a test that showed that Patient's fallopian tubes were not severed, as was necessary for sterilization. Surgeon did not reveal the failure of the operation to Patient, who three years later became pregnant and delivered a baby afflicted with a severe birth defect that will require substantial medical care throughout its life. The birth defect resulted from a genetic defect unknown to, and undiscoverable by, Surgeon. Patient brought an action on her own behalf against Surgeon, seeking to recover the cost of her medical care for the delivery of the baby, and the baby's extraordinary future medical expenses for which Patient will be responsible. Which of the following questions is relevant to the lawsuit and currently most difficult to answer?
1460	The owner of Newacre executed and delivered to a power company a right-of-way deed for the building and maintenance of an overhead power line across Newacre. The deed was properly recorded. Newacre then passed through several intermediate conveyances until it was conveyed to Sloan about ten years after the date of the right-of-way deed. All the intermediate deeds were properly recorded, but none of them mentioned the right-of-way. Sloan entered into a written contract to sell Newacre to Jones. By the terms of the contract, Sloan promised to furnish an abstract of title to Jones. Sloan contracted directly with Abstract Company to prepare and deliver an abstract to Jones, and Abstract Company did so. The abstract omitted the right-of-way deed. Jones delivered the abstract to his attorney and asked the attorney for an opinion as to title. The attorney signed and delivered to Jones a letter stating that, from the attorney's examination of the abstract, it was his "opinion that Sloan had a free and unencumbered marketable title to Newacre." Sloan conveyed Newacre to Jones by a deed which included covenants of general warranty and against encumbrances. Jones paid the full purchase price. After Jones had been in possession of Newacre for more than a year, he learned about the right-of-way deed. Sloan, Jones, Abstract Company. and Jones's attorney were all without actual knowledge of the existence of the right-of-way prior to the conveyance from Sloan to Jones. If Jones sues Abstract Company for damages caused to Jones by the presence of the right-of-way, the most likely result will be a decision for
1461	A dentist filling a child's cavities used a newly developed local anesthetic that was more effective than Novocain. However, it carried a 1% risk of causing a serious seizure when administered to children, which the dentist did not mention to the child's mother. The child's dental work was completed without any problem, but the mother looked up the anesthetic on the Internet and learned about the risk. She complained to the dentist that she would not have consented to use of the anesthetic had she known of the risk, but the dentist argued that using the new anesthetic was justified in the child's case because otherwise he would not have been willing to sit still for the dental work. Does the mother have a cause of action on behalf of the child against the dentist?
1462	A fashionista purchased a wardrobe closet at an antique auction. Three days later, while cleaning the inside of the closet, she discovered a small quantity of a white powder inside a box. She showed the box to her boyfriend, a paralegal. He identified the powder as driscamine, a controlled substance. He told her that it was illegal to buy driscamine, but because she did not know that it was in the closet when she purchased it, it was okay to keep it, which she did. A state statute prohibits "willful and unlawful possession of a controlled substance." If the fashionista is charged with violating this statute, she should be found:
1463	Congress enacted legislation intended to protect children from unsafe car seats. The act established a commission to supervise the manufacturing and sale of car seats, and empowered the commission to promulgate car seat safety regulations. The commission members were also required to investigate safe and sound methods of installing child car seats. The commission's chairperson was designated as an Undersecretary of Health and Safety; the President appointed two commissioners from child safety groups; and the three major car seat manufacturers chose one commissioner each, who were then appointed by Congress to the commission. For its violation of the commission's rules with regard to car seat manufacturing, a car seat manufacturer was fined $5,000, to be paid immediately without a trial on the merits. The manufacturer files suit in the federal court to enjoin the commission's enforcement of this rule. The manufacturer's best argument in support of its contention that the rule was illegal is:
1464	A state contains major deposits of natural gas. In an effort to support this industry, and at the same time save its citizens substantial sums for the cost of heating their homes and businesses, the legislature enacted a substantial tax on out-of-state suppliers of natural gas. In addition, the state required state-licensed public utilities to buy no less than 75% of their natural gas needs from sources within the state as long as their needs could be met. An out-of-state supplier ("the supplier") brought suit against the state challenging this statute. The best constitutional argument the supplier could make is that the statute violates:
1465	"Look-alike drugs" is the term used to describe nonprescription drugs that look like narcotic drugs and are sold on the streets as narcotic drugs. After extensive hearings, Congress concluded that the sale of look-alike drugs was widespread in this country and was creating severe health and law enforcement problems. To combat these problems, Congress enacted a comprehensive statute that regulates the manufacture, distribution, and sale of all nonprescription drugs in the United States. Which of the following sources of constitutional authority can most easily be used to justify the authority of Congress to enact this statute?
1466	A state engaged a private company to run its lottery, but the state maintained close regulation of the manufacture and distribution of lottery equipment by the private company in order to prevent frauds. One lottery regulation required the company to submit to the state all applications of persons being considered for employment. The state ran background checks on the prospective employees to ensure that they did not have a criminal record. A prospective employee that did not pass the state background check could not be hired by the company. An employee of the company who had a poor work record and called in sick often was spotted by her supervisor dancing at a bar one evening after she had called in sick during the day. The supervisor immediately told the employee that she should consider herself terminated, although the employee tried to explain that she in fact had been sick that morning but began feeling well by mid-afternoon. A state law provided that employees of the state could not be fired from their positions except for cause. The woman sued in federal court, claiming that she was constitutionally entitled to a hearing to determine whether her supervisor had cause to fire her. If the court rules correctly, it will probably find the employee's termination:
1467	The defendant drug company developed a new drug for treatment of a genetic disease. The defendant extensively tested the drug for several years on animals and human volunteers and had observed no undesirable side effects. The federal Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") then approved the drug for sale as a prescription drug. Five other drug companies, each acting independently, developed drugs identical to the defendant's drug. Each of these drugs was also approved by the FDA for sale as a prescription drug. A wholesaler bought identically shaped pills from all six of the manufacturers and sold the pills to drugstores as a branded product. This drug had a long-delayed side effect. Sons of male users of the product are sterile. One such son, the plaintiff, brought an action against the defendant for his damages. The defendant, through the wholesaler, supplied about 10% of the branded product sold in the state where the plaintiff lived. It is not possible to establish which of the five companies supplied the particular pills that the plaintiff's father took. If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant based on strict liability in tort, which of the following will be a decisive question in determining whether the plaintiff will prevail?
1468	A patient sought psychiatric treatment from a psychiatrist. During the treatment, the psychiatrist, unbeknownst to the patient, videotaped her. No sound recording was made of the sessions, but the psychiatrist was conducting a study on "body language" and planned to use the videotapes in those experiments. The patient learned that the psychiatrist had been videotaping their analysis sessions and brought an action against him for battery. If the patient does not prevail as to this theory, it will probably be because:
1469	A public high school publishes a weekly newspaper as part of its journalism class. The student editor-in-chief of the paper wrote an article supporting the legalization of marijuana and showed it to his faculty advisor. The advisor told the editor that while this issue was receiving a lot of media attention in their community, in order to discourage drug use, school policy prohibited the paper from including any drugrelated articles. The advisor then told the editor not to include the article in any edition of the paper. A few days later, the editor and faculty advisor were preparing to upload the electronic files for the paper to their printer. The advisor was momentarily called away, and the editor quickly replaced an article on clothing styles with his article on the legalization of marijuana. When the paper came out, the article was the talk of the school. After a brief investigation, the student was removed from his position as editor-in-chief. The student brought suit against the school, claiming that his removal was a violation of his First Amendment rights under color of law. How should the court rule on this issue?
1470	The plaintiff sued the defendant, who had constructed the plaintiff's house, for breach of warranty of habitability. At trial, in crossexamination of the plaintiff, the defendant's attorney asked whether the plaintiff had sued another contractor 30 years earlier, claiming similar defects in another house built for the plaintiff. The question was not objected to and the plaintiff answered that she had had some "water problems" with the first house she ever purchased, but no suit was filed. The defendant then called as a witness the contractor of 30 years earlier to testify that the plaintiff had brought suit against him for defects in the earlier house, many of which were like those now claimed to be found in the home the defendant built, but that the case was settled without trial. The trial court should rule the witness's offered testimony:
1471	A homeowner orally agreed to sell her land to a buyer for $79,000. As a condition of the sale, the buyer orally agreed to pay $5,000 of the purchase price to a creditor of the homeowner. The buyer asked his secretary to prepare a formal, typewritten copy of the contract and, in so doing, the buyer's secretary accidentally left out the condition to pay the $5,000 to the creditor. Both the buyer and the homeowner read the document before signing, but neither noticed the oversight. The buyer refuses to pay the $5,000 to the creditor, and the creditor sues the buyer for the $5,000. In the creditor's suit against the buyer for $5,000, who will prevail?
1472	Dove is on trial for theft. At trial, the prosecutor called John and May Wong. They testified that, as they looked out their apartment window, they saw thieves across the street break the window of a jewelry store, take jewelry, and leave in a car. Mrs. Wong telephoned the police and relayed to them the license number of the thieves' car as Mr. Wong looked out the window with binoculars and read it to her. Neither of them has any present memory of the number. The prosecutor offers as evidence a properly authenticated police tape recording of May Wong's telephone call with her voice giving the license number, which is independently shown to belong to Dove's car. The tape recording of May Wong's stating the license number is
1473	A landowner validly conveyed a small office building to the Green Party "as long as they use it for operating quarters until the next presidential election." After the next presidential election, which was in three years, the building would go to a private organization that monitors and prepares comprehensive listings of gas prices throughout the country. A year after the conveyance, the landowner died, validly devising all of her property to her son. Although this jurisdiction is a common law jurisdiction with respect to all real property considerations, the state's probate laws provide that future interests or estates in real property may be passed by will or descent in the same manner as present or possessory interests. Last week, the Green Party and the gas monitoring organization joined together to sell the office building in fee simple absolute to a developer. The son filed suit to prevent the sale of the property to the developer. In this action, judgment will be for:
1474	A hairstylist entered into a contract with a hairspray manufacturer in which the manufacturer agreed to supply the hairstylist with all of its "long lasting" hairspray (reputed to be the longest lasting in the industry) that the hairstylist would need over the next five years. In the second year of the contract, the hairspray manufacturer learned that the hairstylist was "butchering" high-profile clients' hair and using the hairspray to hold the style, and feared that the negative publicity would harm its reputation and decrease sales. It sent a letter to the hairstylist stating that it would send no more hairspray. If the hairstylist files suit for specific performance against the manufacturer, will he prevail?
1475	Dean, charged with murder, was present with her attorney at a preliminary examination when White, who was the defendant in a separate prosecution for concealing the body of the murder victim, testified for the prosecution against Dean. When called to testify at Dean's trial, White refused to testify, though ordered to do so. The prosecution offers evidence of White's testimony at the preliminary examination. The evidence is
1476	A driver picked up his cousin and his best friend to go to a concert. The friend sat in the front seat, and the cousin sat in back. On the way to the concert, the friend pulled out a water pipe with which to smoke marijuana. He handed it to the driver, and then grabbed the steering wheel in order to steer the vehicle while the driver lit up the water pipe. The driver continued to operate the brake and gas pedals with his feet. As the driver smoked the water pipe, the steering wheel slipped from the friend's hand, and the car smashed into a tree. The cousin in the back seat was injured, incurring a broken wrist and a broken ankle. She sued both the driver and the friend for damages. Following a trial, the jury found the driver 60% negligent and the friend 40% negligent, and awarded the cousin a total of $10,000 for medical expenses and $100,000 for pain and suffering. Because the driver is insolvent, the cousin wants to collect all of the damages from the friend. In the absence of a statute on the issue, may she do so?
1477	On February 1, a tire manufacturer telephoned a car dealership and offered to sell to the dealership 50 sets of its best-selling tires for $5,000. The dealership accepted immediately. On February 3, the dealership sent the tire manufacturer a letter confirming the deal and stating that it was counting on a 20% discount due to the size of the purchase. The tire manufacturer did not respond to the letter. What price must the dealership pay for the 50 sets of tires?
1478	A sportscaster on a local television show interviewed the parent of a child on a high school football team. The interviewee told the sportscaster that the head football coach "openly condones the use of steroids by team members." The coach, who had always conducted a strong anti-drug program for his football players, watched and recorded the show daily. He was outraged when he saw the live broadcast, and filed suit for defamation against the interviewee, the sportscaster, and the television station. At the trial of the suit, the coach wishes to testify as to what the interviewee said on the television show. The defense objects. Should such testimony be admitted?
1479	A landowner sold his summer home to a neighbor. The deed to the neighbor reserved for the landowner, his heirs, and assigns the right of first refusal to purchase the summer home when it was offered for sale. The neighbor recorded the deed. Twenty-five years later, in an attempt to avoid the consequences of the covenant, the neighbor deeded the summer home to her friend as a "gift." The friend recorded the deed, which did not contain the right of first refusal covenant. The friend then sold the land to a buyer for $150,000, giving the proceeds of the sale to the neighbor. The buyer knew nothing about the right of first refusal because she inspected only the friend's deed from the neighbor. When the landowner learned of what had happened, he filed suit to compel conveyance of the land to him. The jurisdiction in which the property is located has an unmodified common law Rule Against Perpetuities and the following statute: 'Any conveyance of an interest in land, other than a lease for less than one year, is not valid against any subsequent purchaser for value and without notice, whose conveyance is first recorded." The landowner will most likely:
1480	In a deed to a parcel of land, the landowner inserted a covenant binding "the purchaser, his heirs, and assigns" to offer "the landowner, his heirs, and assigns" the right of first refusal to purchase the property when it was offered for sale. The property was conveyed to the purchaser, and the deed containing the right of first refusal was duly recorded. After the purchaser lived on the property for 23 years, he was approached by a developer who wanted to purchase the property. To get around the right of first refusal, the purchaser deeded the property as a "gift" to his friend, who was willing to act as a "straw man." The friend recorded the deed, which did not contain the right of first refusal covenant, and the friend then sold the land to the developer for $200,000, giving the proceeds of the sale to the purchaser. The developer knew nothing about the right of first refusal because he inspected only the friend's deed from the purchaser. When the original landowner learned of the sale, he filed suit to compel conveyance of the land to him, backing it up with a $200,000 letter of credit. The jurisdiction in which the property is located has an unmodified common law Rule Against Perpetuities and the following recording statute: "Any conveyance of an interest in land, other than a lease for less than one year, shall not be valid against any subsequent purchaser for value, without notice, whose conveyance is first recorded." How will the court most likely rule in this case?
1481	The defendant was on trial for driving while intoxicated and injuring a pedestrian. The pedestrian claimed that the defendant was driving the car; however, the defendant's spouse testified at trial that she had been driving the car at the time of the accident and had not consumed any alcohol that evening. In response, the prosecution calls a friend of the defendant's spouse to testify that the spouse told the friend that she and the defendant had changed seats in the car after the incident and that she remained in the driver's seat until the police arrived. The testimony is:
1482	The victim and another player regularly played backgammon together. The other player was entered in an upcoming backgammon tournament and asked the victim if she could borrow his attractive custom-made backgammon set. He agreed, provided in return that he could hold her backgammon computer until the backgammon set was returned. After having success at the tournament with the victim's set, the other player decided to travel to the national championship tournament, but she needed her backgammon computer to hone her game. Not wanting to go to the nationals with her own cheap set, she told the defendant, another weekly club player, that her backgammon computer had been borrowed by the victim, and asked him to get it from the victim's car at the next meeting of the club. At the backgammon club meeting, the defendant, who was not aware of the arrangement between the victim and the other player, removed the computer from the victim's car without telling him. The next day, while waiting to meet the player at the airport to give her the computer, the defendant was playing a game on it when a stranger stopped to admire it. The stranger offered the defendant $400 for the computer, and the defendant readily agreed. If the defendant is prosecuted for larceny of the backgammon computer from the victim's car, he will be found:
1483	A husband and wife own a vineyard as tenants by the entirety. Without consulting each other, the husband transfers his interest in the vineyard to his brother by quitclaim deed, and the wife mortgages her interest to her sister in exchange for a loan. What interest, if any, does the sister have?
1484	A grand jury was investigating a bank robbery. The only information known to the prosecutor was a rumor that Taylor might have been involved. The grand jury subpoenaed Taylor. He refused to answer questions about the robbery and was granted use immunity. He then testified that he and Simmons had robbed the bank. The grand jury indicted both Taylor and Simmons for the bank robbery. The prosecutor permitted Simmons to enter a plea to a lesser offense in exchange for Simmons' agreement to testify against Taylor. The prosecutor had no evidence as to the identity of the robbers except the testimony of Simmons and Taylor. At Taylor's trial, his objection to Simmons' being permitted to testify should be
1485	Astin left her car at Garrison's Garage to have repair work done. After completing the repairs, Garrison took the car out for a test drive and was involved in an accident that caused damages to Placek. A statute imposes liability on the owner of an automobile for injuries to a third party tht are caused by the negligence of any person driving the automobile with the owner's consent. The statute applies to situations of this kind, even if the owner did not specifically authorize the mechanic to test-drive the car. Placek sued Astin and Garrison jointly for damages arising from the accident. In that action, Astin cross-claims to recover from Garrison the amount of any payment Astin may be required to make to Placek. The trier of fact has determined that the accident was caused solely by negligent driving on Garrison's part, and that Placek's damages were $100,000. In this action, the proper outcome will be that
1486	Tune Corporation, a radio manufacturer, and Bill's Comex, Inc., a retailer, after extensive negotiations entered into a final, written agreement in which Tune agreed to sell and Bill's agreed to buy all of its requirements of radios, estimated at 20 units per month, during the period January 1, 1988, and December 31, 1990, at a price of $50 per unit. A dispute arose in late December, 1990, when Bill's returned 25 undefective radios to Tune for full credit after Tune had refused to extend the contract for a second three-year period. In an action by Tune against Bill's for damages due to return of the 25 radios, Tune introduces the written agreement, which expressly permitted the buyer to return defective radios for credit but was silent as to return of undefective radios for credit. Bill's seeks to introduce evidence that during the three years of the agreement it had returned, for various reasons, 125 undefective radios, for which Tune had granted full credit. Tune objects to the admissibility of this evidence. For this question only, assume the following facts. When Bill's returned the 25 radios in question, it included with the shipment a check payable to Tune for the balance admittedly due on all other merchandise sold and delivered to Bill's. The check was conspicuously marked, "Payment in full for all goods sold to Bill's to date." Tune's credit manager, reading this check notation and knowing that Bill's had also returned the 25 radios for full credit, deposited the check without protest in Tune's local bank account. The canceled check was returned to Bill's a week later. Which of the following defenses would best serve Bill's?
1487	Opal owned several vacant lots in ABC Subdivision. She obtained a $50,000 loan from a lender, Bank, and executed and delivered to Bank a promissory note and mortgage describing Lots 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The mortgage was promptly and properly recorded. Upon payment of $10,000, Opal obtained a release of Lot 2 duly executed by Bank. She altered the instrument of release to include Lot 5 as well as Lot 2 and recorded it. Opal thereafter sold Lot 5 to Eva, an innocent purchaser, for value. Bank discovered that the instrument of release had been altered and brought an appropriate action against Opal and Eva to set aside the release as it applied to Lot 5. Opal did not defend against the action, but Eva did. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides: "No unrecorded conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value without notice, who shall first record." The court should rule for
1488	Olin owned Blueacre, a valuable tract of land located in York County. Olin executed a document in the form of a warranty deed of Blueacre, which was regular in all respects except that the only language designating the grantees in each of the granting and habendum clauses was: "The leaders of all the Protestant Churches in York County." The instrument was acknowledged as required by statute and promptly and properly recorded. Olin told his lawyer, but no one else, that he had made the conveyance as he did because he abhorred sectarianism in the Protestant movement and because he thought that the leaders would devote the asset to lessening sectarianism. Olin died suddenly and unexpectedly a week later, leaving a will that bequeathed and devised his entire estate to Plum. After probate of the will became final and the administration on Olin's estate was closed, Plum instituted an appropriate action to quiet title to Blueacre and properly served as defendant each Protestant church situated in the county. The only evidence introduced consisted of the chain of title under which Olin held, the probated will, the recorded deed, the fact that no person knew about the deed except Olin and his lawyer, and the conversation Olin had with his lawyer described above. In such action, judgment should be for
1489	An architect, who had been a lawyer's roommate and lover for several years, decided to leave the lawyer and move in with a doctor. On the day that the architect was to move into the doctor's condominium, the lawyer shot the architect in the neck, intending to kill him. The architect was not severely wounded, but he was hospitalized for several days. During his stay at the hospital, it was discovered that the architect had developed a form of cancer that was invariably fatal. Three weeks after being shot, the architect died of pneumonia caused by an infection resulting from the bullet wound in his neck. The doctor had been killed when his condo burned down as he slept. The fire occurred two days after the lawyer shot the architect. Is the lawyer guilty of a criminal homicide?
1490	Dahle is charged with possession of heroin. Prosecution witness Walker, an experienced dog trainer, testified that he was in the airport with a dog trained to detect heroin. As Dahle approached, the dog immediately became alert and pawed and barked frantically at Dahle's briefcase. Dahle managed to run outside and throw his briefcase into the river, from which it could not be recovered. After Walker's experience is established, he is asked to testify as an expert that the dog's reaction told him that Dahle's briefcase contained heroin. Walker's testimony is
1491	The plaintiff brought a breach of contract suit against the defendant, alleging that the defendant paid for only 25 cases of baseball cards even though the order was for 50. The defendant claimed that only 25 cases were delivered to his store. The plaintiff then introduced a shipping bill from a freight company showing that pickup had been made from the plaintiff on 50 cases. May the defendant now compel the plaintiff to introduce the remainder of the record, showing that the freight company had only 25 cases of baseball cards on its truck?
1492	A seller entered into a written contract to sell his factory to a manufacturer. Before the closing date, the manufacturer found an alternate site that was better suited to her business. The manufacture notified the seller that she would not be going through with the closing. The seller sued the manufacturer for specific performance. If the court rules in favor of the manufacturer, it will be because:
1493	Congress enacted a statute appropriating money to the states on condition that the states use the money to support "public performances of classical ballet open to the public." The statute provided that the money was not to be used to support any other type of dance, and that tickets to any performance paid for with these funds were to be distributed to the public on a first come, first served basis. A state that accepted a grant of $500,000 under the federal statute gave half of the grant to a state-sponsored ballet company.aThe company had been started 20 years earlier as part of a state effort to bring culture to poor, inner-city areas. By state law enacted when the company was formed, no less than 35% of the tickets to each performance of the ballet company must be distributed to the inner-city school systems to be given to minority school children. Is the state's method of distributing tickets to the state ballet company's performances constitutional?
1494	Parents purchased a new mobile home from Seller. The mobile home was manufactured by Mobilco and had a ventilating system designed by Mobilco with both a heating unit and an air conditioner. Mobilco installed a furnace manufactured by Heatco and an air conditioning unit manufactured by Coolco. Each was controlled by an independent thermostat installed by Mobilco. Because of the manner in which Mobilco designed the ventilating system, the first time the ventilating system was operated by Parents, cold air was vented into Parents' bedroom to keep the temperature at 68F (20'C). The cold air then activated the heater thermostat, and hot air was pumped into the bedroom of Child, the six-month-old child of Parents. The temperature in Child's room reached more than 170F (77'C) before Child's mother became aware of the condition and shut the system off manually. As a result, Child suffered permanent physical injury. Claims have been asserted by Child, through a duly appointed guardian, against Mobilco, Seller, Heatco, and Coolco. If Child's claim against Seller is based on negligence, the minimum proof necessary to establish Seller's liability is that the ventilating system
1495	A landowner owned a large tract of land in an area zoned for medium residential use. Permitted uses in this zone are single-family dwellings, condominium and townhouse developments, and moderate density apartment complexes. The landowner subdivided her land into 10 lots and conveyed each lot by a deed restricting the land to single-family use. All deeds were duly recorded and all lots were developed as singlefamily homes. The owner of lot 1 died and his property passed by will to his niece. Some time later, the owner of lot 3 sold his property to a buyer by a deed that did not contain the covenant limiting use to single-family dwellings. The buyer subsequently sold lot 3 to her friend, and did not include the covenant in the deed. Both deeds were duly recorded. A storm destroyed the friend's home, and in its place he began to build a three-unit townhouse. May the niece sue to enforce the covenant against the friend to prevent him from building the townhouse on lot 3?
1496	Congress provided funds to a group of young scouts. A person believed that this particular scouting group practiced racial discrimination and brought suit to enjoin the federal provision of funds to this group. Assuming the factual allegation regarding racial discrimination is correct and that the person has standing to challenge the expenditure, how should the court rule?
1497	A mother was in a nursing home and asked her attorney to draft a deed that would give her farm to her son. The attorney drew up the deed, had the mother properly execute it, and thereafter properly recorded the deed. The attorney then told the son what she had done. The son immediately went to the nursing home and told the mother that he did not want the farm so she should take back the deed. A week later, the mother returned home to the farm. Shortly thereafter, the son died without a will, leaving his wife as his only heir. The mother has brought an action against the wife to quiet her title to the farm. If the mother is successful in this action, it will be because:
1498	A three-year-old girl attending nursery school punched a boy in the face because he was teasing her about wearing glasses. The blow knocked out the boy's newly acquired front teeth. If the boy's parents sue the girl's parents for the injury, the best defense would be:
1499	A state statute divides murder into degrees. First degree murder is defined as murder with premeditation and deliberation or a homicide in the commission of arson, rape, robbery, burglary or kidnapping. Second degree murder is all other murder at common law. In which of the following situations is Defendant most likely to be guilty of first degree murder?
1500	A salesman was employed by a florist, who owned a retail shop adjacent to a large wholesale nursery. The owner of the nursery liked to use a brand-name artificial fertilizer for her plants, although other effective fertilizers were available at comparable prices. She stored a large quantity of the fertilizer in a heap on the nursery's property, as did many other nursery owners without incident. The fertilizer gave off fumes that caused the salesman to suffer lung irritation. Occasionally, the salesman's irritations became so bad that he had to take off from work and seek medical attention. After losing a few hundred dollars in wages and amassing a few hundred dollars in medical expenses, the salesman sued the nursery owner for damages. The court is likely to rule in favor of:
1501	A father owned a piece of property located near the state university. His son was a student at the university, and the father allowed the son and the son's classmate to live in the large house on the property rent free. On the son's 20th birthday, the father handed the son a signed instrument of conveyance containing the following language: "I give the property to my dearly beloved son on the condition precedent that he receive a college degree before he reaches the age of 30, and if he does not receive the degree by his 30th birthday, to my beloved daughter." The son promptly recorded the deed. Shortly thereafter, the son asked his classmate to start paying him rent. An argument evolved out of the son's request and the son told the classmate to get off his property. The classmate refused to leave and the son filed suit to evict him. How will the court rule?
1502	A housepainter and a landlord of a two-flat entered into a written agreement whereby the painter would paint both apartments for $2,000, in anticipation of new tenants moving in. The painter told the landlord that after he finished the job, the landlord should pay the $2,000 to the paint store on Main Street, where the painter has an open account and owes the store several thousand dollars. The landlord agreed. The painter informed the store owner of the arrangement. The store owner responded by saying that he did not care who paid him, but the painter's account was seriously overdue, and if he did not get paid by June 1 he would sue. Shortly thereafter, the painter and landlord modified their agreement to push back the work for several months and, as a result, the landlord would not be paying the paint store the $2,000 or any part of it by June 1. The store owner learned about this latest turn of events the next day. When June 1 rolled around, and neither party paid the store owner the $2,000, the store owner sued the landlord for that amount. Who will prevail?
1503	Al and Bill are identical twins. Al, angry at David, said, "You'd better stay out of my way. The next time I find you around here, I'll beat you up." Two days later, while in the neighborhood, David saw Bill coming toward him. As Bill came up to David, Bill raised his hand. Thinking Bill was Al and fearing bodily harm, David struck Bill. If Bill asserts a claim against David and David relies on the privilege of self-defense, David will
1504	In a trial between a farmer and his neighbor, an issue arose about the farmer's ownership of a horse, which had caused damage to his neighbor's crops. The neighbor offered to testify that he looked up the farmer's telephone number in the directory, called that number, and that a voice answered, "This is [the farmer] speaking." At this, the neighbor asked, "Was that your horse that trampled across my cornfield this afternoon?" The voice replied, "Yes." The neighbor had not spoken to the farmer prior to the phone conversation. The judge should rule the testimony:
1505	Defendant became intoxicated at a bar. He got into his car and drove away. Within a few blocks, craving another drink, he stopped ails car in the middle of the street, picked up a brick, and broke the display window of a liquor store. As he was reaching for a bottle, the night watchman arrived. Startled, Defendant turned, struck the watchman on the head with the bottle, killing him. Only vaguely aware of what was happening, Defendant returned to his car, consumed more liquor, and then drove off at a high speed. He ran a red light and struck and killed a pedestrian who was crossing the street. Relevant statutes define burglary to include "breaking and entering a building not used as a dwelling with the intent to commit a crime therein." Manslaughter is defined as the "killing of a human being in a criminally reckless manner." Criminal recklessness is "consciously disregarding a substantial and unjustifiable risk resulting from the actor's conduct." Murder is defined as "the premeditated and intentional killing of another or the killing of another in the commission of committing rape, robbery, burglary, or arson." Another statute provides that intoxication is not a defense to crime unless it negates an element of the offense. Defendant was charged with the murder of the watchman and manslaughter in the death of the pedestrian. Assume that he is tried separately on each charge. At Defendant's trial for the murder of the watchman, the court should in substance charge the jury on the issue of the defense of intoxication that
1506	A facility for mentally ill patients had a high security area for patients deemed to be dangerous. The doors in that section had sophisticated double locks, and the staff was regularly trained in security procedures. However, one night a newly hired employee, who had not yet been instructed in all of the security procedures and had not finished reading the training manual, was left in charge of the high security area. A dangerous patient escaped from the hospital out of a rear door which the employee had not locked. Without any provocation, the patient brutally beat a resident of the town in which the hospital was located. If the resident sues the hospital for his injuries, what is the resident's best argument for a recovery?
1507	A girlfriend and boyfriend decided to get married. The girlfriend was one month short of her 18th birthday, and the boyfriend was 19. They went to a jeweler who made wedding rings to order and described what they were interested in. The girlfriend and boyfriend then signed a purchase order for two rings, a woman's band for $500 and a man's for $650. After the girlfriend's 18th birthday, the rings were ready. The girlfriend went to the jeweler and told him that they would not be needing the rings because she and the boyfriend had broken up. When he protested that they were custom-made and would probably not sell to anyone else, the girlfriend said, "All right, I've got $400 in my savings account. I'll take my ring, but you'll have to find my boyfriend about the other one." The jeweler had the girlfriend sign another purchase order for the woman's band at $400, payment to be made by the end of the month. When the jeweler did not hear from the girlfriend after another month, he brought an action for breach of contract against her. Evidence produced at trial established that the market value of the rings was $500 and $650 for the woman's and man's rings, respectively, and that the age of majority in the jurisdiction was 18. Is the jeweler entitled to recover against the girlfriend?
1508	An art collector was interested in buying a painting from his neighbor. The neighbor told the collector that he could have the painting for $30,000. The collector wanted to think the purchase over. Therefore, the two agreed in writing that the neighbor would keep the offer open for 30 days in exchange for $500, which the collector paid. The terms of the written agreement provided that the offer would expire at 11:59 p.m. on September 30 if the collector failed to accept by that time. On September 20, the collector telephoned his neighbor and told him, "The more I think about it, the less I think that I want your painting." The neighbor responded, "That's your decision to make." On September 26, one of the neighbor's friends was visiting him, saw the painting, and offered his friend (the neighbor) $35,000 for it. On September 27, the neighbor mailed a $50 check to the collector with a letter stating that he was terminating his offer to the collector regarding the painting and refunding 10% of the money that the collector paid him to keep the offer open. He mailed the letter at 11:59 p.m. on September 27. The collector received the letter at 11:30 a.m. on September 29. On September 28, at 9:30 a.m., the collector mailed a letter to his neighbor stating that he had decided to purchase the painting and a certified check in the amount of $30,000 was enclosed. Two hours later, the neighbor sold the painting to his friend for $35,000. The neighbor received the collector's letter on October 1 and immediately mailed the check back to the collector. Can the collector maintain a successful legal action against his neighbor?
1509	At an intersection, a motorist's car struck the car of a mother who was driving her teenage son to school. The mother was killed in the collision. The mother's estate brought a wrongful death action against the motorist on behalf of the mother's son and daughter, her sole heirs. At trial, evidence introduced by the estate established that the motorist drove through a red light at the intersection. Evidence introduced by the motorist showed that the son was showing his mother a video on his phone just before the collision occurred. The evidence introduced by the motorist:
1510	A state statute makes it unlawful to willfully cause or permit the life or health of a child under the age of 18 to be endangered or to willfully cause or permit a child to be placed in circumstances that endanger the child's life or health. A local prosecutor brought charges against parents who brought their child to their church's religious service in which venomous snakes were passed around, and the parents were convicted. Which of the following best describes the likely result if the parents appeal their convictions on constitutional grounds?
1511	The complainant was robbed by a man wielding an unusual knife with a pearl-studded handle. The defendant was arrested and charged with armed robbery of the complainant. At trial the prosecution calls a witness to testify that, three days after the robbery of the complainant, she was robbed by the defendant with a knife that had a pearl-studded handle. The court should hold that the witness's testimony is:
1512	On June 1, Buyem, Inc., a widget manufacturer, entered into a written agreement with Mako, Inc., a tool maker, in which Mako agreed to produce and sell to Buyem 12 sets of newly designed dies to be delivered August 1 for the price of $50,000, payable ten days after delivery. Encountering unexpected expenses in the purchase of special alloy steel required for the dies, Mako advised Buyem that production costs would exceed the contract price; and on July 1 Buyem and Mako signed a modification to the June 1 agreement increasing the contract price to $60,000. After timely receipt of 12 sets of dies conforming to the contract specifications, Buyem paid Mako $50,000 but refused to pay more. Which of the following concepts of the Uniform Commercial Code, dealing expressly with the sale of goods, best supports an action by Mako to recover $10,000 for breach of Buyem's July 1 promise?
1513	A man and a woman were arrested and charged with conspiring to blow up a federal government building. After being given Mira warnings, they were questioned separately an each of them gave a written confession. The confessions interlocked with each other, impi cating both of the defendants as being involve in every stage of the conspiracy. Subsequently the woman attempted to retract her confessio claiming that it was false. At a preliminary hearing, the judge rejected her claim. Both defendants were tried together, and the prose cutor introduced both confessions into evider At trial, the woman testified that she was not involved in any conspiracy and that her confer sion was fabricated. Both defendants were foi guilty by the jury. If the woman challenges her conviction on appeal because of the admission of the man's confession and succeeds, it will be because:
1514	An architect who specialized in the design of large buildings designed a resort hotel for a hotel chain. The architect took into account weather conditions where the hotel was to be built, and came up with two designs that would cost approximately the same amount to construct to specifications. One of them had the four large supporting pylons set so that it could withstand winds 20% higher than the region had experienced in the 85 years that the weather bureaus kept records for the area. The other design set the pylons farther apart, but they would withstand winds 50% higher than the region had experienced. The architect decided to go with the first (20% margin) design, because he felt it was more aesthetically pleasing, and also because a 20% safety margin was usually considered adequate. Officers of the hotel chain reviewed and approved the architect's plans, and the hotel was constructed according to the plans. Two years after the hotel opened, a freak storm struck, bringing with it winds of hurricane force. The hotel suffered significant damage, which would have been avoided had the supporting pylons been placed farther apart. If the hotel chain sues the architect for the damage to the hotel, who will prevail?
1515	The defendant was invited over to a friend's house one night for drinks. The friend told the defendant that he wanted to show him a pistol that he had stolen. After showing him the pistol, they decided to go out to a bar. As they got to the defendant's car, the defendant realized that he had left his coat in the house and told the friend that he was going back to get it. The defendant opened the front door and went to the room where his coat was. As the defendant picked up his coat, he saw the stolen pistol on the table. Realizing that he could get some quick cash by reselling it, he put it in his pocket and returned to his car. In a common law jurisdiction, the defendant could be convicted of:
1516	After a heavy snow and ice storm, a shopkeeper posted signs on his store's front windows saying, "Beware of falling ice." A chunk of ice fell off the store's roof and hit a customer on the sidewalk in front of the store, causing her to suffer a concussion. The customer was texting on her cell phone and was not looking at her surroundings, and did not see the signs. The customer sued the shopkeeper for her injuries in a jurisdiction that retains traditional contributory negligence rules. The above facts were established at trial. At the conclusion of the proofs, both parties moved for a directed verdict. The trial judge should:
1517	Doppler is charged with aggravated assault on Vezy, a game warden. Doppler testified that, when he was confronted by Vezy, who was armed and out of uniform, Doppler believed Vezy was a robber and shot in self-defense. The state calls Willy to testify that a year earlier, he had seen Doppler shoot a man without provocation and thereafter falsely claim self-defense. Willy's testimony is
1518	Eureka, Inc., inventor of the LBVC, a laser-beam vegetable chopper, ran a television ad that described the chopper and said, "The LBVC is yours for only $49.99 if you send your check or money order to Box 007, Greenville. Not available in stores." Gourmet, who owned a retail specialty shop, wrote Eureka, "What's your best firm price for two dozen LBVCs?" Eureka sent a written reply that said in its entirety, "We quote you for prompt acceptance $39.99 per unit for 24 LBVCs." Gourmet subsequently mailed a check to Eureka in the appropriate amount, with a memo enclosed saying, "I accept your offer for 24 LBVCs." For this question only, assume the following facts: Eureka shipped 24 LBVCs to Gourmet after receiving his check and memo, and with the shipment sent Gourmet an invoice that conspicuously stated, among other things, the following lawful provision: "These items shall not be offered for resale at retail." Gourmet received and read but disregarded the invoice restriction and displayed the 24 LBVCs for resale. Eureka has a cause of action against Gourmet for breach of contract only if
1519	A patient was admitted to a hospital to undergo an x-ray procedure that required him to be tilted up. During the procedure, the technician improperly strapped the patient to an x-ray table designed for the procedure. There was a footrest at the bottom of the table to help support the patient, but the bolts holding the footrest gave way and the footrest fell off. Had the patient been securely strapped in, he would have remained on the table. However, the loss of the footrest caused sufficient additional pressure on the straps that they loosened, and the patient fell from the table, struck his head, and suffered injuries. The patient sued the manufacturer of the x-ray table, which supplied the table fully assembled, on a theory of strict liability for his injuries. Judgment will likely be for:
1520	A 15-year-old girl who worked as a prostitute in a city approached a man and offered her services. The man agreed, and the two engaged in sexual intercourse in the back seat of the man's car. These events were noticed by an undercover police officer, who arrested the girl and the man. The man admitted to having sex with the girl, and he was charged with statutory rape. The girl was charged with being an accomplice to statutory rape. At the girl's trial, her best defense is that:
1521	The owner of a tract of land with a house on it entered into a lease with a tenant for a term of three years. The tenant installed a batting cage, an automatic pitching machine, and electric lights in the backyard of the land for her son, an amateur baseball player. Six months after entering into the lease, the owner mortgaged the land to a bank to secure a loan. The tenant was not notified directly of the mortgage but the mortgage was recorded. Two months before the lease term was to end, the owner defaulted on his mortgage payments, and the bank began foreclosure proceedings, as it was entitled to do under the terms of the mortgage. The tenant, knowing her lease would soon end but not being aware of the foreclosure proceedings, began to remove all of the equipment she had installed in the backyard. The bank brought an action to enjoin the removal of the equipment, naming both the tenant and the owner as defendants in the suit. If the court refuses the injunction, it would be because:
1522	In compliance with a federal statute requiring buildings to be made accessible to persons with disabilities, a lawyer installed wheelchair ramps at both entrances to his office building located on a parcel of land that he had owned for many years. One year later, the lawyer entered into a contract with an accountant to sell the parcel of land, including the office building. After having the property surveyed, the accountant notified the lawyer that she was not going to complete the sale because the wheelchair ramp on the south side of the building extended over the property line and into the adjoining tract of land, making the title unmarketable. The lawyer insisted that the accountant proceed with the sale, and brought an action to compel her performance. If the court were to find that title is marketable, it will be because:
1523	A testator died, leaving a valid holographic will that provided: "I want my only son to have my house when I die and to live there as long as he wants. After that, I want it to go to my grandchildren." At the time of the testator's death, her son was married and had a daughter, the testator's only grandchild, who was also married. Both the son and his wife moved into the house, but about six months later they separated and the wife moved out. The following year, the son and the granddaughter were involved in an airplane crash in which the son was immediately killed. Several weeks later, the granddaughter died, leaving her husband as her only heir. The son's wife brings a suit against the granddaughter's husband claiming an interest in the house as the son's widow. There is no statute in this jurisdiction that governs the issue of the right of an estranged spouse to inherit property from a decedent spouse, but if the son is found to own property at the time of his death, it is possible that the son's wife could inherit one-half as his surviving spouse. In this suit, the son's wife should most likely:
1524	On March I, Green and Brown orally agreed that Brown would erect a boathouse on Green's lot and dig a channel from the boathouse, across Clark's lot, to a lake. Clark had already orally agreed with Green to permit the digging of the channel across Clark's lot. Brown agreed to begin work on the boathouse on March 15, and to complete all the work before June 1. The total price of $10,000 was to be paid by Green in three installments: $2,500 on March 15; $2,500 when the boathouse was completed; $5,000 when Brown finished the digging of the channel. Assume that Green tendered the $2,500 on March 15, and that Brown refused to accept it or to perform. In an action by Green against Brown for breach of contract, which of the following can Brown successfully use as a defense? I. The Clark-Green agreement permitting the digging of the channel across Clark's lot was not in writing. II. The Green-Brown agreement was not in writing.
1525	A patient met with a surgeon prior to a surgical procedure that would involve the implantation of a medical device in the patient's artery. The surgeon advised the patient of risks and benefits, but she did not advise him that there was a 1% chance of a defect occurring in the manufacturing process of the medical device that would cause the device to break during the surgery. The patient gave his consent and underwent the surgery. The medical device did break during surgery as a result of the manufacturing defect, causing damage to his artery. The patient then underwent additional surgery that repaired the damage. He subsequently learned about the 1% risk of the medical device breaking. In a malpractice action by the patient against the surgeon, which of the following questions will not be at issue?
1526	Eighteen-year-old Kenneth and his 14- year-old girlfriend, Emma, made plans to meet in Kenneth's apartment to have sexual intercourse, and they did so. Emma later told her mother about the incident. Kenneth was charged with statutory rape and conspiracy to commit statutory rape. In the jurisdiction, the age of consent is 15, and the law of conspiracy is the same as at common law. Kenneth was convicted of both charges and given consecutive sentences. On appeal, he contends that his conspiracy conviction should be reversed. That conviction should be
1527	A yoga instructor entered into a valid written contract with a builder to construct a large yoga studio on some land she owned outside of town. She agreed to pay the builder $150,000 upon completion of the job. As work progressed, and due to substantial increased building costs, the yoga instructor and the builder orally agreed that the builder may omit installation of the koi pond planned for the atrium (saving the builder $1,000), and that the contract price would be reduced to $149,500. The builder completed the job (minus the koi pond) in reliance thereon. Most courts would hold that this subsequent oral agreement is:
1528	A city ordinance provided that anyone who wanted to speak in a public park must have a permit to do so issued by the city. The ordinance granted the mayor discretion to issue or deny such permits based on the mayor's judgment of whether the speech would be "in the public interest." The mayor has never denied a permit to anybody desiring to speak on a political topic. A city resident who was unhappy with the city government went to a public park in the city square. There, he made a 10-minute speech accusing the mayor and the city council of gross incompetence and urging voters to "throw the rascals out" at the next election. The city resident had not applied for a permit. After the resident completed his oration, the police arrested him and charged him with violating the permit ordinance. Would a conviction of the resident be constitutional?
1529	BCD, a manufacturer of computers, pays its salespeople a salary of $1,000 per month and a commission of 5% on billings actually rendered for machines that they sell. BCD salespeople are employed at will under written agreements which provide that in order to receive a commission the salesperson must be in the employment of the company when the bill is sent to the customer. In 1976, John, a salesperson for BCD, worked for eight months to get an order from Bobb Corporation for a large $750,000 computer. He consulted extensively with Bobb's top executives and worked with its operating personnel to dt.velop detailed specifications for the new equipment. He also promised Bobb, with BCD's knowledge and approval, to assist Bobb for six months after installation in making the equipment work. On January 1, 1977, Bobb signed an order, and on March 1 the computer was installed. On March 15, BCD fired John on the stated ground that he had failed to meet his 1975 and 1976 sales quotas. John thought that BCD was correct in this statement. Another salesperson, Franklin, was thereupon assigned to service the Bobb account. On March 31, BCD billed Bobb for the computer. Assume for this question only that BCD's termination of John's employment was not wrongful. If John sues BCD for the reasonable value of his services, which of the following is the most likely result?
1530	An East Coast seller of knockoff French handbags and a discount department store chain buyer in the Midwest entered into a contract whereby the seller would sell to the department store 1,000 of a specific brand of its handbags for a price of $20 apiece, with the seller delivering the handbags "F.O.B. Chicago CSX Terminal." The handbags were sent by rail to Chicago; midway through the trip, the freight car that was carrying the handbags was struck by lightning and caught fire, destroying the handbags. If the seller brings suit against the buyer, which has refused to pay the contract price for the handbags, the seller will:
1531	John's father, Jeremiah, died in Hospital. Hospital maintains a morgue with refrigerated drawers a bit larger than a human body. Jeremiah's body was placed in such a drawer awaiting pickup by a mortician. Before the mortician called for the body, a Hospital orderly placed two opaque plastic bags in the drawer with Jeremiah's body. One bag contained Jeremiah's personal effects, and the other contained an amputated leg from some other Hospital patient. It is stipulated that Hospital was negligent to allow the amputated leg to get into Jeremiah's drawer. The mortician delivered the two opaque plastic bags to John, assuming both contained personal effects. John was shocked when he opened the bag containing the amputated leg. John sued Hospital to recover for his emotional distress. At the trial, John testified that the experience had been extremely upsetting, that he had had recurring nightmares about it, and that his family and business relationships had been adversely affected for a period of several months. He did not seek medical or psychiatric treatment for his emotional distress. Who should prevail?
1532	In an action by the plaintiff against the defendant, one of the issues is whether the defendant is a licensed physical therapist. Normally, the names of all licensed physical therapists are registered with the office of the state Department of Professional Registrations. The plaintiff wishes to introduce a certified document, signed by the chief registrar of the department (who cannot be located), stating that an examination of the department's rolls does not disclose the defendant's name. Should the document be admitted?
1533	A 12-year-old girl entered a grocery store. When she believed that no one was looking, she grabbed two candy bars and concealed them under her coat. As she attempted to leave the store, a security guard employed by the store grabbed the girl by the arm. He told her, "You're too young to be a thief!" The girl began crying and blurted out, "I lost my lunch money on the way to school and I was really hungry!" If the girl is charged with shoplifting, what is the prosecution's best argument that her Miranda rights have not been violated by the security guard?
1534	The owner of a shopping center entered into a two-year lease with a tenant who was opening a greeting card shop. When the lease still had 14 months left to run, the tenant decided to sell his business and inventory to a successor. When the tenant told the mall owner that he planned to assign his lease to the successor, the mall owner objected, citing a clause in the lease requiring consent to any assignment and providing that any attempted assignment without consent is grounds for terminating the lease. The tenant assigned the lease to the successor anyway. The successor operated the card store in the same manner as the tenant, the only difference being a change of the store's name. Does the mall owner have any recourse against the tenant or the successor?
1535	A mother executed a will, devising a vacant parcel of land to her daughter. The daughter moved her mobile home onto the land. Two years later, the mother conveyed the land to an investor for $25,000 by a quitclaim deed. The investor, knowing nothing of the mother's will, recorded the deed but has never visited the land. The following year, the mother died, survived by her daughter. The jurisdiction in which the land is located has a five-year limitations period for adverse possession along with the following statute: No conveyance of an interest in land, other than a lease for less than one year, shall be valid against any subsequent purchaser for value, without notice thereof, unless the conveyance is recorded. If the daughter sues to quiet title to the land for whom should the court rule?
1536	A defendant is being sued by his insurance company for filing a false claim. The insurance company seeks recovery of payment made to the defendant for the alleged theft of his car. At trial, the insurance company seeks to have the defendant's ex-wife testify that he told her that he had really given the car to a friend. The defendant objects on the ground of privilege. The ex-wife:
1537	A man purchased a new power boat with an inboard engine from a boating supply store. The boating supply store properly inspected the boat before delivery, but did not detect a virtually invisible manufacturing defect in the boat's steering mechanism. Later that summer, the man was entertaining some friends on his boat on a lake near a dam. There were some warning pylons near the dam, warning boaters to stay clear. The man decided to show off for his friends by weaving his boat in and out of the warning pylons. As he rounded the last of them, the steering mechanism of his boat jammed, and the boat crashed into the dam. The man was severely injured. The man brings an action for damages against the boating supply store on a theory of strict liability in tort in a jurisdiction that does not apply its comparative fault rules to strict liability actions. Who will prevail?
1538	A landowner conveyed his land to his wife, son, and daughter "as joint tenants with right of survivorship." The daughter then conveyed her interest to a friend. The wife subsequently executed a will devising her interest to the daughter. Then the son mortgaged his interest to a lender, who promptly and properly recorded the mortgage. The wife died, then the daughter's friend died, leaving a will that bequeathed her entire estate to the daughter. The daughter and the son survived. If the jurisdiction follows the title theory, who owns what interest in the land?
1539	A shopper was in a large department store that was remodeling its menswear department and had hired a contractor to do the work. A carpenter employed by the contractor was working on the remodeling job. When the carpenter left the store to take her lunch break, she left a carpenter's level projecting out into one of the aisles, unbeknownst to any store employees. Shortly before she returned from lunch an hour later, the shopper came down that aisle and tripped over the level. He fell and struck his head on the sharp corner of a display case. The shopper required hospitalization and sued the store for his injuries. Will the shopper prevail in his suit against the store?
1540	At trial, questions have been raised as to whether the proposed testimony of the witness is relevant and whether it falls within the present sense impression exception to the hearsay rule. As to a preliminary determination of the admissibility of the witness's testimony:
1541	A developer owned a large parcel of land, which she subdivided into 25 separate lots. The developer sold lots 1 - 24, retaining lot 25 for herself to live on. The deeds for each of the 24 lots sold by the developer restricted the use of the land to residential purposes only. The purchasers of lots 1 - 24 each built residences on their property. The developer lived on lot 25 in the subdivision until her death, when it was sold without any restrictions to a buyer. Several years ago, the buyer sold lot 25 to a merchant, without any restrictions. Last month, the merchant decided to build a convenience store on lot 25. An adjoining owner in the subdivision informed the merchant of the restriction and told him that he would be unable to build the convenience store. If the restriction to use the land for residential purposes only is held to apply to lot 25, it will be because the restriction is:
1542	A woman elected to a state legislature is prosecuted in federal court for violating the civil rights of a member of the janitorial staff of the state legislature's building in connection with a sexual assault that occurred in her office. The woman raises as a defense the claim that the allegedly wrongful acts were committed in the course of legislative business, and she is immune from scrutiny by the federal courts. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument in favor of the woman's defense?
1543	Two friends were on their way to a football game when they were injured as their car was sideswiped and driven off the road by a large truck belonging to a delivery company. The friends brought an action against the truck driver and the delivery company, alleging negligence by the truck driver in driving too fast. The delivery company answered and asserted the affirmative defense that the driver of the car had been on cocaine and was intoxicated at the time of the accident. The delivery company's counsel seeks to have the highway patrolman who investigated the accident state that he overheard the car driver tell his passenger, "This was probably all our fault; we shouldn't have been on coke." Assuming the trial judge takes judicial notice that "coke" means "cocaine," the judge should rule that the tender of evidence is:
1544	A Delaware corporation with its business headquarters in Illinois conducts bar preparation courses for law school graduates. In addition to its national headquarters, the corporation rents local administrative headquarters in at least one city in each state. Its instructors are law school professors and other lawyers who are paid an hourly, or occasionally biannual, fee, but each instructor is considered an independent contractor and prepares his or her own lecture outlines and respective study outlines that are provided to students. Some instructors lecture only in one or more cities in the same state, while other instructors lecture in cities throughout the United States. A professor who is a resident of the state of Virginia gives lectures on Constitutional Law in more than 20 states, including California. The printer that publishes all of the bar preparation company's instructional materials is located in New York and ships the materials by commercial carriers to the respective state offices of the bar preparation company. The printer does not solicit business and does not have officers or agents outside of New York. Which of the following taxes is most likely valid?
1545	Actor, a well-known movie star, was drinking Vineyard wine at a nightclub. A bottle of the Vineyard wine, with its label plainly showing, was on the table in front of Actor. An amateur photographer asked Actor if he could take his picture and Actor said, "Yes." Subsequently, the photographer sold the photo to Vineyard. Vineyard, without Actor's consent, used the photo in a wine advertisement in a nationally circulated magazine. The caption below the photo stated, "Actor enjoys his Vineyard wine." If Actor sues Vineyard to recover damages as a result of Vineyard's use of the photograph, will Actor prevail?
1546	Sue Starr, a minor both in fact and appearance, bought on credit and took delivery of a telescope from 30-year-old Paul Prism for an agreed price of $100. Upon reaching her majority soon thereafter, Starr encountered Prism and said, "I am sorry for not having paid you that $100 for the telescope when the money was due, but I found out it was only worth $75. So I now promise to pay you $75." Starr subsequently repudiated this promise and refused to pay Prism anything. For this question only, assume that Starr bought the telescope from Prism after reaching her majority and promised to pay $100 "as soon as I am able." What effect does this quoted language have on enforceability of the promise?
1547	A state statute prohibits speechmaking and loud public gatherings within 250 feet of the state's legislative chamber when the legislature is in session, but permits silent picketing at any time, as long as the picketing does not interfere with pedestrians or traffic. The nearest place to the legislative chamber where speeches could be made during a session is a large public park directly opposite the chamber. During a controversial debate on a proposed bill to ban abortions, a man in the park began voicing his support of the ban. As the man spoke, a crowd of about 250 gathered. When fervor built, the man urged the crowd to cross the street with him to the steps of the legislative chamber to make their voices heard within the legislature. When the chanting crowd reached the front of the chamber, the state police dispersed the crowd and arrested the man, who was subsequently charged with violating the statute. If the man challenges the constitutionality of the statute under which he was charged, a court will most likely find the statute:
1548	It was common practice in a particular state for a security interest in land to be structured as a deed absolute, which gave a lender absolute title to the borrower's property as security for the loan. The lender would reconvey only on complete payment of the loan by the debtor party, and could dispose of the land immediately without a foreclosure sale on default. A new governor of the state whose campaign platform was built around abolishing the deed absolute mortgage encouraged the legislature to enact a bill that immediately outlawed use of the deed absolute, declaring that all such deeds would be considered mere liens against the secured property. The law applied not only to loans made in the future, but also to the thousands of such loans in existence at the time the legislation was passed. As soon as the governor signed the legislation, lending institutions and individuals who had loaned money secured through deeds absolute challenged the constitutionality of the new law. The strongest argument that the challengers can make is:
1549	The plaintiff sued the defendant in an automobile collision case. At trial, the plaintiff wishes to show by extrinsic evidence that the defendant's primary witness is the defendant's partner in a gambling operation. This evidence is:
1550	A state statute requires that all buses which operate as common carriers on the highways of the state shall be equipped with seat belts for passengers. Transport Lines, an interstate carrier, challenges the validity of the statute and the right of the state to make the requirement. What is the best basis for a constitutional challenge by Transport Lines?
1551	The jurisdiction divides murder into degrees, with all murders being second degree murder unless the prosecution can prove premeditation and deliberation, in which case the killing would be first degree murder. The jurisdiction also uses the M'Naghten rule for insanity. A physician prescribed an experimental drug for the defendant's severe allergies. The physician told the defendant that the medication was experimental, but failed to inform the defendant that the manufacturer had reported a small risk that the medicine caused severe delusions. After taking the medicine the first day, the defendant began to believe that his next door neighbor was spreading false rumors about him to a few of his other neighbors. While still under the influence of the medication, the defendant grabbed a knife from the kitchen, went to his neighbor's house, and rang the doorbell. When the neighbor answered the door, the defendant plunged the knife into his neighbor's chest, killing him instantly. May the defendant be convicted of first degree murder?
1552	To combat rising insurance rates, a state formed a state-owned insurance company that operated exclusively within the state. The company provided insurance on the basis of premiums calculated according to a schedule of fees. Under the schedule, premiums for residents of a particular city were 25% higher than the premiums for any other municipality in the state. Forty percent of that city's residents were of Mexican descent compared with a state-wide Mexican-American population of approximately 15%. A Mexican-American citizen living in the city brings suit, alleging that the state insurance company's rate structure violates the Equal Protection Clause. The most likely result is:
1553	A defendant, on trial for robbing the victim of some jewelry, relied on the defense that he was only trying to recover property that the alleged victim had previously stolen from him. The trial court instructed the jury that the prosecution must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and that if the jury should find that the defendant had established by a preponderance of the evidence that he was only trying to recover his property, they should find him not guilty. After he was convicted of robbery, the defendant asserts that the instruction to the jury was error. His conviction should probably be:
1554	In a signed writing, Nimrod contracted to purchase a 25-foot travel trailer from Trailco for $15,000, cash on delivery no later than June 1. Nimrod arrived at the Trailco sales lot on Sunday, May 31, to pay for and take delivery of the trailer, but refused to do so when he discovered that the spare tire was missing. Trailco offered to install a spare tire on Monday when its service department would open, but Nimrod replied that he did not want the trailer and would purchase another one elsewhere. Which of the following is accurate?
1555	Motorist arranged to borrow his friend Owner's car to drive for one day while Motorist's car was being repaired. Owner knew that the brakes on his car were faulty and might fail in an emergency. Owner forgot to tell Motorist about the brakes when Motorist picked up the car, but Owner did telephone Spouse, Motorist's wife, and told her about them. Spouse, however, forgot to tell Motorist. Motorist was driving Owner's car at a reasonable rate of speed and within the posted speed limit, with Spouse as passenger. Another car, driven by Cross, crossed in front of Motorist at an intersection and in violation of the traffic signal. Motorist tried to stop, but the brakes failed, and the two cars collided. If the brakes had been in proper working order, Motorist could have stopped in time to avoid the collision. Motorist and Spouse were injured. If Motorist asserts a claim against Cross, Motorist will
1556	Peter, who was 20 years old, purchased a new, high-powered sports car that was marketed with an intended and recognized appeal to youthful drivers. The car was designed with the capability to attain speeds in excess of 100 miles per hour. It was equipped with tires designed and tested only for a maximum safe speed of 85 miles per hour. The owner's manual that came with the car stated that "continuous driving over 90 miles per hour requires high-speed-capability tires," but the manual did not describe the speed capability of the tires sold with the car. Peter took his new car out for a spin on a straight, smooth country road where the posted speed limit was 55 miles per hour. Intending to test the car's power, he drove for a considerable distance at over 100 miles per hour. While he was doing so, the tread separated from the left rear tire, causing the car to leave the road and hit a tree. Peter sustained severe injuries. Peter has brought a strict product liability action in tort against the manufacturer of the car. You should assume that pure comparative fault principles apply to this case. Will Peter prevail?
1557	A plaintiff sued a defendant to rescind a contract for fraud and damages. The plaintiff alleged in his complaint that, pursuant to a written contract, he had purchased a business from the defendant in reliance on the defendant's fraudulent representations as to the value of the business's inventory and cash on hand. At trial, without objection, the plaintiff introduced the written contract, which included recitals of facts containing the statement: "the company is solvent, with inventory and cash assets valued at $200,000" and a boilerplate integration clause (i.e., "no other representations have been made," etc.). The plaintiff proposes to testify that during negotiations the defendant said the real value of the business in cash and inventory was about $500,000, but that tax laws made it inexpedient to recite the real value. The defendant objects. The offered evidence is:
1558	The owner of a summer cottage contracted to put new vinyl siding on the cottage for $10,500. Two weeks before the work was to start, however, the contractor called to say that there was a clerical error in the bid and that he could not do the work for less than $12,000 or he would lose money. The cottage owner agreed to pay the additional $1,500 but told the contractor that he was being unfair. After the work was completed, the cottage owner handed the contractor a check for $10,500, telling the contractor that that was all he would pay him because he had no right to raise the price. If the contractor sues the cottage owner for the additional $1,500, who will prevail?
1559	On July 1, a cattle rancher offered to sell his ranch to a dairy farmer for $150,000. The dairy farmer paid the cattle rancher $1,000 to hold the offer open for a period of 30 days. On July 10, the dairy farmer wrote to the cattle rancher, telling him that he could not pay more than $100,000 for the ranch, and that if he would not agree to accept that amount, he would not go through with the deal. The dairy farmer received no reply from the cattle rancher. On July 29, the dairy farmer mailed a letter to the cattle rancher telling him that he accepted his offer to sell the ranch and enclosed a check for $150,000. The cattle rancher received this letter on August 1. Has a contract been formed between the parties for the sale of the ranch?
1560	The State of Rio Grande entered into a contract with Roads, Inc., for construction of a four-lane turnpike. Prior to commencement of construction, the legislature, in order to provide funds for parks, repealed the statute authorizing the turnpike and cancelled the agreement with Roads, Inc. Roads, Inc., sued the state to enforce its original agreement. In ruling on this case, a court should hold that the state statute cancelling the agreement is
1561	While a driver was driving an owner's car, he hit a plaintiff who was walking in a pedestrian right-of-way. The plaintiff sues the owner, alleging that that owner had negligently permitted an unfit driver to use her car. As part of her defense, the owner calls her husband to testify for her. The husband offers testimony that, when the owner loans her automobile to anybody, the owner invariably checks to see whether the driver is careful and law abiding. The plaintiff objects to the admission of this evidence. The plaintiff's objection should be:
1562	Commercial fishing has long been one of the major industries of a coastal state. To protect the fishing industry and to promote the general welfare of the state's citizens, the legislature of the state enacted statutes requiring licenses for commercial fishing. An applicant for the license must pay a $300 fee and establish that he has been engaged in commercial fishing in the waters of the state for 10 years. A commercial fisherman residing in a neighboring state frequently takes his fishing boat up the coast. His favorite spot is approximately two miles off the coast of the legislating state. If the commercial fisherman challenges the constitutionality of the legislating state's statutes, the court should find the statutes:
1563	The plaintiff sued the defendant on a breach of contract theory. A witness testified for the plaintiff. On cross-examination, which of the following questions is the trial judge most likely to rule improper?
1564	A fee simple owner of a restaurant provided in his will that the property should go on his death "in fee simple to my friend, but if during my friend's lifetime my son has children and those children are alive when my friend dies, then to said living children." When the owner died, the friend took over the restaurant. If the son has children and one or more of them are alive when the friend dies, who will take title to the restaurant at that time?
1565	An underworld informer advised a police investigator that his neighbor was running an illegal bookmaking operation in his apartment, and that the informer had placed bets with the neighbor at this location. The officer obtained a search warrant, based on his affidavit reciting the foregoing facts, and further stating that the underworld informer was a person who had given him accurate information in previous cases, but whose identity could not be revealed because it might jeopardize other criminal investigations being carried on by the police. Armed with the search warrant, police officers went to the neighbor's apartment. They entered when the neighbor opened the door and searched the apartment. They seized various wagering slips and bookmaking apparatus (described in the search warrant) and placed the neighbor under arrest for illegal gambling. Prior to trial, the neighbor challenges the validity of the search warrant. Was the search warrant valid?
1566	For several weeks Mater, a wealthy, unemployed widow, and Nirvana Motors, Inc., negotiated unsuccessfully over the purchase price of a new Mark XX Rolls-Royce sedan, which, as Nirvana knew, Mater wanted her son Dilbert to have as a wedding gift. On April 27, Nirvana sent Mater a signed, dated memo saying, "If we can arrive at the same price within the next week, do we have a deal?" Mater wrote "Yes" and her signature at the bottom of this memo and delivered it back to Nirvana on April 29. On May 1, Mater wrote Nirvana a signed letter offering to buy "one new Mark XX Rolls-Royce sedan, with all available equipment, for $180,000 cash on delivery not later than June 1." By coincidence, Nirvana wrote Mater a signed letter on May 1 offering to sell her "one new Mark XX Rolls-Royce sedan, with all available equipment, for $180,000 cash on delivery not later than June 1." These letters crossed in the mails and were respectively received and read by Mater and Nirvana on May 2. If Mater subsequently asserts and Nirvana denies that the parties had a binding contract on May 3, which of the following most persuasively supports Mater's position?
1567	Broker needed a certain rare coin to complete a set that he had contracted to assemble and sell to Collecta. On February 1, Broker obtained such a coin from Hoarda in exchange for $1,000 and Broker's signed, written promise to re-deliver to Hoarda "not later than December 31 this year" a comparable specimen of the same kind of coin without charge to Hoarda. On February 2, Broker consummated sale of the complete set to Collecta. On October 1, the market price of rare coins suddenly began a rapid, sustained rise; and on October 15 Hoarda wrote Broker for assurance that the latter would timely meet his coin-replacement commitment. Broker replied, "In view of the surprising market, it seems unfair that I should have to replace your coin within the next few weeks." For this question only, assume the following facts. Having received Broker's message on October 17, Hoarda sued Broker on November 15 for the market value of a comparable replacement-coin as promised by Broker in February. The trial began on December 1. If Broker moves to dismiss Hoarda's complaint, which of the following is Broker's best argument in support of the motion?
1568	The owner of a boat took two friends out on a lake near his home. One of his friends was driving the boat when it struck a partially submerged rock that the owner of the boat had forgotten to tell him about. The owner of the boat and the other passenger were injured; the driver of the boat was not hurt. In a jurisdiction that applies joint and several liability with comparative contribution, the passenger brought suit against both the boat owner and the driver, and the boat owner also sued the driver. The jury determined that the boat owner was 55% at fault and suffered $10,000 in damages, the driver of the boat was 45% at fault, and the injured passenger suffered $100,000 in damages. After entry of judgment, the boat owner paid the passenger her total damages of $100,000, while the driver of the boat has paid nothing. How much, if anything, can the boat owner recover from the driver?
1569	Federal legislation required that state and local police departments receiving financial assistance from the Federal Law Enforcement Assistance Agency devote a specified amount of those resources to combatting "white-collar" crimes. Which of the following would provide the best constitutional underpinning for this legislation?
1570	The defendant was charged with aggravated assault. The defendant did not testify at trial; however, he sought to offer opinion evidence of his good character for truth and veracity. This testimony should be:
1571	Farquart had made a legally binding promise to furnish his son Junior and the latter's fiancee a house on their wedding day, planned for June 10, 1972. Pursuant to that promise, Farquart telephoned his old contractor-friend Sawtooth on May 1, 1971, and made the following oral agreementeach making full and accurate written notes thereof: Sawtooth was to cut 30 trees into fireplace logs from a specified portion of a certain one-acre plot owned by Farquart, and Farquart was to pay therefor S20 per tree. Sawtooth agreed further to build a house ,n the plot conforming to the specifications of Plan OP5 published by Builders, Inc. for a construction price of Sl8,000. Farquart agreed to make payments of $2,000 on the first of every month for nine months beginning August I, 1971, upon monthly presentation of a certificate by Builders. Inc. that the specifications of Plan OP5 were being met. Sawtooth delivered the cut logs to Farquart in July 1971, when he also began building the house. Farquart made three S2.,000 payments forthe work done in July, August, and September 1971, without requiring a certificate. Sawtooth worked through October, but no work was done from November 1, 1971. to the end of February 1972. because of bad weather: and Farquart made no payments during that period. Sawtooth did not object. On March 1, 1972, Sawtooth demanded payment of $2,000 but Farquart refused on the grounds that no construction work had been done for four months and Builders had issued no certificate. Sawtooth thereupon abandoned work and repudiated the agreement. What was the probable legal effect of the following? I. Sawtooth's failure to object to Farquart's making no payments on November 1, December I , January 1, and February I II. Farquart's making payments in August through October without requiring a certificate from Builders.
1572	A state with a number of automobile manufacturing facilities within its borders and a high unemployment rate because of declining sales of automobiles, especially ones built domestically, enacted a statute calling for a $100-per-car tax on all foreign-built automobiles sold within the state. The tax revenues were to be placed into a state fund to be used to retrain the state's unemployed automobile workers. A major automobile importer and dealership owner brings suit in federal district court seeking to halt the enforcement of the statute on constitutional grounds. The court should find the statute:
1573	The defendant was fired from his sales job while calling on customers in another city. He failed to return the company car that he was using for his sales visits; instead, he sold the car to a "chop shop" for cash. The defendant has committed:
1574	A brother and sister, Bruce and Sharon, acquired as joint tenants a twenty-acre parcel of land called Greenacre. They contributed equally to the purchase price. Several years later, Bruce proposed that they build an apartment development on Greenacre. Sharon rejected the proposal but orally agreed with Bruce that Bruce could go ahead on his own on the northerly half of Greenacre and Sharon could do what she wished with the southerly half of Greenacre. Bruce proceeded to build an apartment development on, and generally developed and improved, the northerly ten acres of Greenacre. Sharon orally permitted the southerly ten acres of Greenacre to be used by the Audubon Society as a nature preserve. Bruce died, leaving his entire estate to his son, Stanley. The will named Sharon as executrix of his will, but she refused so to serve. In an appropriate action to determine the respective interests of Sharon and Stanley in Greenacre, if Sharon is adjudged to be the owner of all of Greenacre, the most likely reason for the judgment will be that
1575	Photo, a free-lance photographer, took a Picture of Player in front of Shoe Store. Player was a nationally known amateur basketball star who had received much publicity in the press. At the time, the window display in Shoe Store featured "Jumpers," a well-known make of basketball shoes. Photo sold the picture, greatly enlarged, to Shoe Store and told Shoe Store that Photo had Player's approval to do so and that Player had consented to Shoe Store's showing the enlarged picture in the window. Shoe Store made no effort to ascertain whether Player had given his consent to Photo. In fact, Player did not even know that Photo had taken the picture. Shoe Store put the enlarged picture in the window with the display of "Jumpers" shoes. The college that Player attended believed that Player had intentionally endorsed Shoe Store and "Jumpers" shoes, and the college cancelled his athletic scholarship. If Player asserts a claim based on invasion of privacy against Shoe Store, will Player prevail?
1576	A brother and sister were in the middle of a very large lake on a fishing trip, out of sight of land, when their boat ran out of gas. The brother spotted a large fishing boat in the distance. Knowing that fishing boats carried extra gas cans on board, the brother and sister paddled toward the other boat. The brother told his sister to sneak onto the other ship and steal a gas can. The sister got onto the other boat and grabbed a gas can when a fisherman on the boat, who was 6'6" tall and weighed 250 pounds, grabbed her arm. The sister was terrified and picked up a heavy bucket and hit the fisherman on the head; he slumped to the ground apparently dead. The brother then ran up and told the sister that the fisherman was dead and that they had to put him in the water so it would look like he drowned after slipping and falling off the boat. They thereupon put the fisherman in the water without attempting to determine if he was alive or dead. Later, a medical examination showed conclusively that the blow only knocked the fisherman out; he died of suffocation due to water in the lungs. The brother was charged with causing the death of the fisherman. If the jury believes the brother's story that he thought the fisherman was already dead before he and the sister put the body in the water, although he had made no effort to determine if the fisherman was alive, the killing was:
1577	A third-year college student telephoned his father and asked for $1,000 for living expenses. The father agreed to send him the money but told him that he needed to find a classier girlfriend or he would get no more money. The son thanked his father, and promptly went to a jeweler and selected an engagement ring for his girlfriend priced at $5,000. The son, who was 21 years of age, signed a contract to purchase the ring. The contract required the son to make a $1,000 down payment and then to make a series of installment payments. The son planned to use the $1,000 check he was expecting from his father for the down payment. The father discovered the son's plan to buy the engagement ring and refused to send the $1,000 check. The jeweler is now demanding that the son make the $1,000 down payment on the ring and pay the first installment as well. Can the son legally enforce his father's promise to send the $1,000?
1578	Johnson wanted to purchase a used motor vehicle. The used car lot of Car Company, in a remote section away from town, was enclosed by a ten-foot chain link fence. While Johnson and Sales Representative, an employee of Car Company, were in the used car lot looking at cars, a security guard locked the gate at 1:30 p. i., because it was Saturday and the lot was supposed to be closed after 1:00 p. m. Saturday until Monday morning. At 1:45 p. m., Johnson and Sales Representative discovered they were locked in. There was no traffic in the vicinity and no way in which help could be summoned. After two hours, Johnson began to panic at the prospect of remaining undiscovered and without food and water until Monday morning. Sales Representative decided to wait in a car until help should come. Johnson tried to climb over the fence and, in doing so, fell and was injured. Johnson asserts a claim against Car Company for damages for his injuries. If Johnson's claim is based on negligence, is the defense of assumption of the risk applicable?
1579	A seller received a written offer in the mail signed by a buyer to purchase the seller's land for $50,000. The written offer was legally sufficient to form a written contract for the sale of the land. The seller called the buyer and said that the offer was acceptable, but that she wanted her attorney to review it. The seller asked her attorney to prepare a formal contract for the sale of the land according to the same terms and conditions in the written offer. When the attorney had finished, the seller signed the contract and mailed it to the buyer. Later that day, before the buyer had received the contract, a developer called the seller and offered to buy the land for $60,000, which the seller accepted immediately over the phone. The seller called the buyer and told him that she had received and accepted a higher offer. The seller then signed a written contract to sell the land to the developer. When the developer received the contract, he signed it and then promptly and properly recorded it, and sent the seller the specified down payment. The buyer received the written contract from the seller the next day. The recording statute in the jurisdiction provides: "Any conveyance of an interest in land, other than a lease for less than one year, shall not be valid against a subsequent purchaser for value, without notice thereof, whose conveyance is first recorded." In an appropriate action brought by the buyer against the seller and the developer for specific performance and to quiet title, the buyer will:
1580	A man and a woman were arrested and charged with a series of armed robberies. Each suspect was given Miranda warnings, and different interrogation teams questioned each suspect separately. Upon being questioned, the man told the police, "I'm not going to talk until I see a lawyer." An officer responded, "You might want to reconsider, because your partner has already confessed, and she's implicated you in the crimes." The man then told the police that he wanted to talk to the woman privately. The police escorted the man to the woman's cell, locked him in with her, and left. Unbeknownst to either of them, the police had bugged the woman's cell and recorded both the man and the woman making self-incriminating statements during their meeting. The man made no further statements to the police on advice of counsel, whom he called immediately after his conversation with the woman. The man was put on trial first, and the prosecution sought to introduce into evidence tapes of the bugged conversation between the man and the woman. The defense made a motion to suppress the evidence. Should the court grant the motion to suppress?
1581	A defendant is on trial for the murder of the victim, who was found beaten to death in his home. Evidence already presented has shown that the victim was killed when no one was at home except for the victim and his dog. The prosecution wishes to call a neighbor to the stand who is prepared to testify that she went to the victim's home the day after his murder and that when the defendant came by, the dog ran to a corner, where he cringed and whimpered. The neighbor is also prepared to testify that the dog is normally a very friendly dog, usually greeting visitors to the house, including the defendant, by approaching them with his tail wagging. The defense objects to the neighbor's proposed testimony. How should the court rule on the neighbor's testimony regarding the dog's behavior?
1582	A man was staying overnight at a small hotel when he received a phone call telling him that his child had been severely injured and was being rushed to the hospital. The man quickly booked a flight to his home in another part of the state and rushed out to the lobby to check out. He discovered, however, that there was a long line ahead of him and only one clerk on duty. The man realized that he would never make it to the airport in time for his flight if he continued to wait in line, so he left without paying his bill and flew home. That evening, he wrote a letter to the hotel, apologizing for his swift departure and enclosing payment for two nights' lodging; he also added an extra $25 "to cover any inconvenience and billing expense" he may have caused. Meanwhile, the hotel's manager discovered that the man had left without paying. On the hotel's behalf, the hotel manager signed a complaint with the state police, charging the man with theft of services. The police had a warrant sworn out for the man's arrest. The day after the man left the hotel, the hotel received the man's letter and payment. However, no one notified the police that the man had paid his bill. Three days after the man left the hotel, the state police, armed with a warrant, came to the man's office and arrested him. Although he repeatedly told the police that he had paid his bill and suggested that they call the hotel, they refused to do so. After holding the man for several hours, the police called the hotel. The manager confirmed that the man had paid his bill and the police released the man. The man sued the hotel for false imprisonment. Who will prevail?
1583	A husband who believed that his wife was having an affair with his brother hired an arsonist to burn down the brother's house. They planned for the husband to take his brother to a ballgame so that the arsonist would be able to set the house on fire without detection. After the husband and brother left for the ballgame, however, the arsonist decided to abandon the plan and immediately left town without doing anything further. When the husband returned from the ballgame with the brother, he saw the house still standing and blurted out what was supposed to have happened. The husband and the arsonist were arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit arson. At the arsonist's trial, his attorney argued that he was innocent of the conspiracy because he decided not to go ahead with the plan, and nothing criminal had in fact occurred. At common law, a jury should find the arsonist:
1584	A grantor executed and delivered a deed to his daughter conveying his ranch as follows: "To my daughter for life, but if my daughter dies survived by her husband and children, then to my daughter's husband for life, with the remainder in fee simple to my daughter's children; but if my daughter dies survived by her husband and no children, then to my son in fee simple." A few months later, the daughter married; as a wedding gift, the grantor quitclaimed his interest in the ranch to the daughter's husband. Assume that the jurisdiction does not follow the doctrine of destructibility of contingent remainders. A year later, the daughter died without children and without a will. The applicable law of intestate succession provides that the husband is the daughter's only heir. The son claims that the husband has no interest in the land. Title to the ranch is held by whom?
1585	Three thieves agreed to rob a bank. The first was to steal a car to be used for the getaway, the second agreed to procure weapons, and the third would check the bank for cameras. The car thief stole a car and parked it in a lot behind his girlfriend's apartment building. While visiting her the night before the robbery, the car thief suffered a series of convulsive seizures. He was rushed to the hospital where he was placed in the intensive care unit and heavily sedated. Meanwhile the two other thieves, unaware of their accomplice's illness, met and decided to rob the bank on their own, despite the absence of a getaway car and driver. They robbed the bank, but were quickly apprehended as they tried to escape and implicated the car thief under police questioning. The car thief can be charged with:
1586	Paulsen sued Daly for nonpayment of a personal loan to Daly, as evidenced by Daly's promissory note to Paulsen. Paulsen called Walters to testify that he knows Daly's handwriting and that the signature on the note is Daly's. On direct examination, to identify himself, Walters gave his name and address and testified that he had been employed by a roofing company for seven years. During presentation of Daly's case, Daly called Wilson to testify that she is the roofing company's personnel manager and that she had determined, by examining the company's employment records, that Walters had worked there only three years. The trial judge should rule that Wilson's testimony is
1587	The leader of a controversial religious sect, which had been characterized by the government as a "religious cult," sought to broaden his influence by running for the state legislature. The state had no provision barring members of the clergy from serving as legislators. The leader took advantage of the state's liberal voter registration laws by having many of his followers move into the district a month before the election. The leader's subsequent victory in the race prompted a citizens' group to file a lawsuit in federal district court. The suit, invoking the Establishment Clause, sought to enjoin the state legislature from seating the leader in the legislature or expending any state funds to provide him with legislative privileges. The legislature moved to dismiss the lawsuit. Should the court grant the legislature's motion?
1588	On January 2, Hugh Homey and Sue Structo entered into a written contract in which Structo agreed to build on Homey's lot a new house for Homey, according to plans and specifications furnished by Homey's architect, Barbara Bilevel, at a contract price of $200,000. The contract provided for specified progress payments and a final payment of $40,000 upon Homey's acceptance of the house and issuance of a certificate of final approval by the architect. Further, under a "liquidated damages" clause in the agreement, Structo promised to pay Homey $500 for each day's delay in completing the house after the following October 1. Homey, however, told Structo on January 2, before the contract was signed, that he would be on an around-the-world vacation trip most of the summer and fall and would not return to occupy the house until November 1. For this question only, assume the following facts. Because she was overextended on other construction jobs, Structo did not complete the house until October 15. Homey returned on November 1 as planned and occupied the house. Ten days later, after making the $40,000 final payment to Structo, Homey learned for the first time that the house had not been completed until October 15. If Homey sues Structo for breach of contract on account of the fifteen-day delay in completion, which of the following will the court probably decide?
1589	A large tract of land was located in a jurisdiction that has adopted the following statute: No conveyance or mortgage of an interest in land is valid against a subsequent purchaser for value without notice thereof whose conveyance is first recorded. The man who owned the land owed money to a woman, and in satisfaction of this debt, the man conveyed the property to her. Although the woman intended to have the deed recorded, she mistakenly failed to do so. Two years later, the man borrowed money from a bank and, to secure the loan, executed a mortgage deed on the property. The bank promptly recorded this mortgage. Three months later, the man, just before he died, donated the property by general warranty to his son, who did not know about the prior events. The son recorded the deed and entered into a contract with his friend to sell him the property. The next month, the woman discovered that the deed in her safe was not recorded, and so, without notice of any of the prior transactions, the woman recorded the deed. A month after that, the friend paid the son full value for the property, and without actual knowledge of any of the other transactions regarding the property, the friend had the deed duly recorded. By the end of the next year, the friend had expended substantial sums of money on the property. However, when he put up the property as security for a loan from the bank, he learned for the first time of the woman's claim. In a suit between the friend and the woman, which of the following statements most accurately describes the probable outcome?
1590	An article in a newspaper reported that the city's professional basketball franchise announced that financial difficulties have forced them to sell the franchise to a group of investors who will probably move the team to another state. The article stated that, according to inside sources, the main reason for the financial difficulties is that the general manager of the team has been siphoning off proceeds from ticket sales to support his gambling habits. The general manager, who is well-known in the community, brought an action against the newspaper for defamation. If the newspaper stipulates at trial that the statement regarding the general manager is false, what additional facts does he have to prove to recover?
1591	The defendant is being tried for murder. A witness to the crime had aided the police artist in making the composite picture by which the defendant was identified. This witness disappeared before trial, and the prosecutor now wants to offer the sketch into evidence. The sketch is:
1592	A defendant was indicted in state court for bribing a public official. During the course of the investigation, police had demanded and received from the defendant's bank the records of the defendant's checking account for the preceding two years. The records contained incriminating evidence. On the basis of a claim of violation of his constitutional rights, the defendant moves to prevent the introduction of the records in evidence. His motion should be:
1593	A 10-lot subdivision was approved by the proper governmental authority. The authority's action was pursuant to a map filed by Diaz, which included an undesignated parcel in addition to the 10 numbered lots. The undesignated parcel is differently shaped and somewhat larger than any one of the numbered lots. Subdivision building restrictions were imposed on "all the lots shown on said map." Diaz contracts to sell the unnumbered lot, described by metes and bounds, to Butts. Is title to the parcel marketable?
1594	Criminal statutes in the state define murder as "the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought, either express or implied," and define voluntary manslaughter as "the unlawful killing of another human being under an extreme emotional disturbance for which there was reasonable explanation or excuse, without express or implied malice aforethought." Another statute provides that "it shall be an affirmative defense to the charge of murder if the defendant proves by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant was unable to control his actions or conform his conduct to the law." The defendant was charged with murder and tried in state court. At trial, he introduced evidence regarding his state of mind at the time of the homicide, including testimony from a psychiatrist. At the conclusion of the case, the court instructed the jury as follows: Any homicide committed without justification or excuse is murder if the prosecution establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intentionally and unlawfully killed another human being, and malice aforethought may be presumed from proof of the felonious homicide. However, if the defendant establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that he acted under extreme emotional disturbance for which there was reasonable explanation or excuse, he shall be liable only for voluntary manslaughter, because extreme emotional disturbance is inconsistent with, and negates the existence of, malice aforethought. The judge further instructed the jury that it could return an acquittal by reason of insanity "if the defendant established by clear and convincing evidence that he was unable to control his actions or conform his conduct to the law." The jury found the defendant guilty of murder. The defendant appealed, claiming that his constitutional rights were violated by the court's instruction as to voluntary manslaughter and by the requirement that he prove insanity by clear and convincing evidence. The defendant's rights were violated by:
1595	Cars driven by Pugh and Davidson collided, and Davidson was charged with driving while intoxicated in connection with the accident. She pleaded guilty and was merely fined, although under the statute the court could have sentenced her to two years in prison. Thereafter, Pugh, alleging that Davidson's intoxication had caused the collision, sued Davidson for damages. At trial, Pugh offers the properly authenticated record of Davidson's conviction. The record should be
1596	On trial for murdering her husband, Defendant testified she acted in self-defense. Defendant calls Expert, a psychologist, to testify that under hypnosis Defendant had described the killing, and that in Expert's opinion Defendant had been in fear for her life at the time of the killing. Is Expert's testimony admissible?
1597	Kabb, the owner of a fleet of taxis, contracted with Petrol, a dealer in petroleum products, for the purchase and sale of Kabb's total requirements of gasoline and oil for one year. As part of that agreement, Petrol also agreed with Kabb that for one year Petrol would place all his advertising with Ada Artiste, Kabb's wife, who owned her own small advertising agency. When Artiste was informed of the Kabb-Petrol contract, she declined to accept an advertising account from the Deturgid Soap Company because she could not handle both the Petrol and Deturgid accounts during the same year. For this question only, assume the following facts. During the first month of the contract, Kabb purchased substantial amounts of his gasoline from a supplier other than Petrol, and Petrol thereupon notified Artiste that he would no longer place his advertising with her agency. In an action against Petrol for breach of contract, Artiste probably will
1598	Three years ago Adam conveyed Blackacre to Betty for $50,000 by a deed that provided: "By accepting this deed, Betty covenants for herself, her heirs and assigns, that the premises herein conveyed shall be used solely for residential purposes and, if the premises are used for nonresidential purposes, Adam, his heirs and assigns, shall have the right to repurchase the premises for the sum of one thousand dollars ($1,000)." In order to pay the $50,000 purchase price for Blackacre, Betty obtained a $35,000 mortgage loan from the bank. Adam had full knowledge of the mortgage transaction. The deed and mortgage were promptly and properly recorded in proper sequence. The mortgage, however, made no reference to the quoted language in the deed. Two years ago Betty converted her use of Blackacre from residential to commercial without the knowledge or consent of Adam or of the bank. Betty's commercial venture failed, and Betty defaulted on her mortgage payments to the bank. Blackacre now has a fair market value of $25,000. The bank began appropriate foreclosure proceedings against Betty. Adam properly intervened, tendered $1,000, and sought judgment that Betty and the bank be ordered to convey Blackacre to Adam, free and clear of the mortgage. The common-law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified by statute. If the court rules against Adam, it will be because
1599	A plaintiff sued an airline company for negligence for back injuries she sustained when the airplane in which she was a passenger was involved in an accident. The defendant has answered the complaint with a general denial of negligence as well as of personal injuries. Immediately after the accident, the plaintiff was examined and treated by her physician. The physician made an affidavit stating that he had examined the plaintiff the day after the accident and found her to be suffering from a back injury. The physician is now dead. The plaintiff's counsel seeks to introduce the affidavit. The judge should rule the affidavit:
1600	Orin owned in fee simple Blueacre, a farm of 300 acres. He died and by will duly admitted to probate devised Blueacre to his surviving widow, Wilma, for life with remainder in fee simple to his three children, Cindy, Clara, and Carter. All three children survived Orin. At the time of Orin's death, there existed a mortgage on Blueacre that Orin had given ten years before to secure a loan for the purchase of the farm. At his death, there remained unpaid $40,000 in principal, payable in installments of $4,000 per year for the next ten years. In addition, there was due interest at the rate of 10% per annum, payable annually with the installment of principal. Wilma took possession and out of a gross income of $50,000 per year realized $25,000 net after paying all expenses and charges except the installment of principal and interest due on the mortgage. Carter and Cindy wanted the three children, including Clara, to each contribute one-third of the amounts needed to pay the mortgage installments. Clara objected, contending that Wilma should pay all of these amounts out of the profits she had made in operation of the farm. When foreclosure of the mortgage seemed imminent, Clara sought legal advice. If Clara obtained sound advice relating to her rights, she was told that
1601	A wife who maintained a joint checking account with her husband was surprised by an alert from her bank that their account was overdrawn. When she called the bank for an explanation, the bank representative told her that the transaction records showed a large amount of funds withdrawn from the account through a debit card for local escort services, which according to media reports were being investigated by the authorities for prostitution offenses. The wife told the bank representative that the bank must have made a mistake, but he insisted that the records were accurate. After the call, the wife confirmed that her debit card was in her purse and that her husband's was in his wallet. She went out to her husband's car and smashed the headlights with a baseball bat and carved her name in the leather seats. She then accused her husband of infidelity and threatened a divorce. He denied being responsible for the charges and claimed that the bank must have made an error. Because the bank had just closed for a holiday weekend, the husband endured a couple of days of strained relations with his wife before he could go to the bank and have the transaction records reviewed. On further review, the bank discovered that the charges were erroneous and should have been charged to another account. Can the husband recover damages from the bank for defamation?
1602	Ten years ago, a chemical manufacturer decided that it needed a safe place to store toxic waste that was a byproduct of its manufacturing processes. A highly reputable engineering company was hired and an exhaustive survey was performed to find a site. Once the site was selected, the chemicals were stored there underground, using state-of-the-art techniques. However, the surveyors failed to discover a crack in the rock of the storage area that was too small for their instruments to detect. Over a period of years the chemicals began to seep through the crack and into the water table below the surface. Tests disclosed that a nearby city's water supply, all of which came from local wells that tapped into the water table, contained unacceptably high levels of chemical contaminants. The city was required to spend $5 million on a complex filtration system to remove the dangerous chemicals from its water. The city brought an action against the chemical manufacturer to recover the cost of building the filtration system. At the end of the plaintiff's case establishing the above facts, the manufacturer moved for a directed verdict. Should the court grant the manufacturer's motion?
1603	One night when a man was very drunk, he took one of his rifles, loaded it, and fired a bullet through his front door. Unbeknownst to him, at the time he fired the rifle, someone was driving by the house. The bullet went through the front door, through the window of the car, and killed the driver. The shooter was convicted of murder and appeals. He contends that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of murder. The court of appeals should rule that the evidence is:
1604	A statute provides: A person commits the crime of rape if he has sexual intercourse with a female, not his wife, without her consent. Dunbar is charged with the rape of Sally. At trial, Sally testifies to facts sufficient for a jury to find that Dunbar had sexual intercourse with her, that she did not consent, and that the two were not married. Dunbar testifies in his own defense that he believed that Sally had consented to sexual intercourse and that she was his common-law wife. At the conclusion of the case, the court instructed the jury that in order to find Dunbar guilty of rape, it must find beyond a reasonable doubt that he had sexual intercourse with Sally without her consent. The court also instructed the jury that it should find the defendant not guilty if it found either that Sally was Dunbar's wife or that Dunbar reasonably believed that Sally had consented to the sexual intercourse, but that the burden of persuasion as to these issues was on the defendant. The jury found Dunbar guilty, and Dunbar appealed, contending that the court's instructions on the issues of whether Sally was his wife and whether he reasonably believed she had consented violated his constitutional rights. Dunbar's constitutional rights were
1605	A worker was in the habit of carrying a lot of cash with him after payday. His good friend was worried that someday the worker might get robbed. To teach him to be more careful, and intending only to frighten him, the friend purchased a realistic-looking toy gun and a face mask and hid in the bushes one night after payday, waiting for the worker to come home. As the worker passed by, the friend jumped out of the bushes, pointed the toy gun at him, and took all of his money. The worker was badly frightened by the incident. Shortly thereafter, the friend returned the money to the worker and explained why he had staged the holdup. The crimes below are listed in descending order of seriousness. Which of the following is the most serious crime for which the friend can be convicted?
1606	A state enacted a sales tax on specified items purchased within the state. A subdivision of the federal government purchased from a dealer in the largest city in the state 100 new automobiles for use by federal agencies operating within the state. Must the federal government pay the sales tax applicable to the new auto purchase?
1607	Tenant rented a commercial building from Landlord, and operated a business in it. The building's large front window was smashed by vandals six months before expiration of the Tenant-Landlord lease. Tenant, who was obligated thereunder to effect and pay for repairs in such cases, promptly contracted with Glazier to replace the window for $2,000, due 30 days after satisfactory completion of the work. Landlord was then unaware of the Tenant-Glazier contract. Glazier was aware that the building was under lease, but dealt entirely with Tenant. Sixty days after Glazier's satisfactory completion of the window replacement, and prior to the expiration of Tenant's lease, Tenant, then insolvent, ceased doing business and vacated the building. In so doing, Tenant forfeited under the lease provisions its right to the return of a $2,000 security deposit with Landlord. The deposit had been required, however, for the express purpose (as stated in the lease) of covering any damage to the leased property except ordinary wear and tear. The only such damage occurring during Tenant's occupancy was the smashed window. Glazier's $2,000 bill for the window replacement is wholly unpaid. For this question only, assume the following facts. Upon vacating the building, Tenant mailed a $1,000 check to Glazier bearing on its face the following conspicuous notation: "This check is in full and final satisfaction of your $2,000 window replacement bill." Without noticing this notation, Glazier cashed the check and now sues Tenant for the $1,000 difference. If Tenant's only defense is accord and satisfaction, is Tenant likely to prevail?
1608	A homeowner conveyed her home "to my friend for life, and then to my brother's heirs." The brother had a young child at the time of the conveyance. Subsequently, the friend died. The brother and his minor child are still alive. The jurisdiction has abolished the common law rule of destructibility of contingent remainders. Who owns the home?
1609	Ogle owned Greenacre, a tract of land, in fee simple. Five years ago, he executed and delivered to Lilly an instrument in the proper form of a warranty deed that conveyed Greenacre to Lilly "for and during the term of her natural life." No other estate or interest or person taking an interest was mentioned. Lilly took possession of Greenacre and has remained in possession. Fifteen months ago, Ogle died, leaving a will that has been duly admitted to probate. The will, inter alia, had the following provision: "I devise Greenacre to Mina for her natural life and from and after Mina's death to Rex, his heirs and assigns, forever." Administration of Ogle's estate has been completed. Mina claims the immediate right to possession of Greenacre. Rex also asserts a right to immediate possession. In an appropriate lawsuit to which Lilly, Mina, and Rex are parties, who should be adjudged to have the right to immediate possession?
1610	A landowner conveyed her vacant parcel of land "to my neighbor and his heirs, but if the land is sold to a non-Christian person, the grantor has a right to enter and retake the premises." Five years later, the landowner died, leaving her daughter as her sole heir. The following year, the neighbor sold the land to an atheist. The atheist built a single-family home on the land. Fifteen years later, the daughter brings suit to eject the atheist from the land. The period required to establish title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is 10 years. If the court rules for the atheist, it will be because:
1611	Several years ago, Bart purchased Goldacre, financing a large part of the purchase price by a loan from Mort that was secured by a mortgage. Bart made the installment payments on the mortgage regularly until last year. Then Bart persuaded Pam to buy Goldacre, subject to the mortgage to Mort. They expressly agreed that Pam would not assume and agree to pay Bart's debt to Mort. Bart's mortgage to Mort contained a due-on-sale clause stating, "If Mortgagor transfers his/her interest without the written consent of Mortgagee first obtained, then at Mortgagee's option the entire principal balance of the debt secured by this Mortgage shall become immediately due and payable." However, without seeking Mort's consent, Bart conveyed Goldacre to Pam, the deed stating in pertinent part " . . . , subject to a mortgage to Mort [giving details and recording data]." Pam took possession of Goldacre and made several mortgage payments, which Mort accepted. Now, however, neither Pam nor Bart has made the last three mortgage payments. Mort has brought an appropriate action against Pam for the amount of the delinquent payments. In this action, judgment should be for
1612	A city ordinance requires a taxicab operator's license to operate a taxicab in King City. The ordinance states that the sole criteria for the issuance of such a license are driving ability and knowledge of the geography of King City. An applicant is tested by the city for these qualifications with a detailed questionnaire, written and oral examinations, and a practical behind-the-wheel demonstration. The ordinance does not limit the number of licenses that may be issued. It does, however, allow any citizen to file an objection to the issuance of a particular license, but only on the ground that an applicant does not possess the required qualifications. City licensing officials are also authorized by the ordinance to determine, in their discretion, whether to hold an evidentiary hearing on an objection before issuing a license. Sandy applies for a taxicab operator's license and is found to be fully qualified after completing the usual licensing process. Her name is then posted as a prospective licensee, subject only to the objection process. John, a licensed taxicab driver, files an objection to the issuance of such a license to Sandy solely on the ground that the grant of a license to Sandy would impair the value of John's existing license. John demands a hearing before a license is issued to Sandy so that he may have an opportunity to prove his claim. City licensing officials refuse to hold such a hearing, and they issue a license to Sandy. John petitions for review of this action by city officials in an appropriate court, alleging that the Constitution requires city licensing officials to grant his request for a hearing before issuing a license to Sandy. In this case, the court should rule for
1613	On March 1, Zeller orally agreed to sell his land, Homestead, to Byer for $46,000 to be paid on March 31. Byer orally agreed to pay $25,000 of the purchase price to Quincy in satisfaction of a debt which Zeller said he had promised to pay Quincy. On March 10, Byer dictated the agreement to his secretary but omitted all reference to the payment of the $25,000 to Quincy. In typing the agreement, the secretary mistakenly typed in $45,000 rather than $46,000 as the purchase price. Neither Byer nor Zeller carefully read the writing before signing it on March 15. Neither noticed the error in price and neither raised any question concerning omission of the payment to Quincy. In an action by Quincy against Byer for $25,000, which of the following is (are) correct? I. Byer could successfully raise the Statute of Frauds as a defense because the ByerZeller agreement was to answer for the debt of another. II. Byer could successfully raise the Statute of Frauds as a defense because the ByerZeller agreement was for the sale of an interest in land.
1614	In a trial for bank robbery, a teller has identified the defendant as the robber. Defense counsel offers into evidence a still frame from a video taken by the bank security camera the day after the robbery to show that a column obstructed that teller's view of the defendant. Such evidence is:
1615	Gyro, an expert in lifting and emplacing equipment atop tall buildings, contracted in a signed writing to lift and emplace certain air-conditioning equipment atop Tower's building. An exculpatory clause in the contract provided that Gyro would not be liable for any physical damage to Tower's building occurring during installation of the air-conditioning equipment. There was also a clause providing for per diem damages if Gyro did not complete performance by a specified date and a clause providing that "time is of the essence." Another clause provided that any subsequent agreement for extra work under the contract must be in writing and signed by both parties. With ample time remaining under the contract for commencement and completion of his performance, Gyro notified Tower that he was selling his business to Copter, who was equally expert in lifting and emplacing equipment atop tall buildings, and that Copter had agreed to "take over the Gyro-Tower contract." For this question only, assume that Tower orally agreed with Gyro to accept Copter's services and that Copter performed on time but negligently installed the wrong airconditioning equipment. Will Tower succeed in an action against Gyro for damages for breach of contract?
1616	Oscar purchased a large bottle of No-Flake dandruff shampoo, manufactured by Shampoo Company. The box containing the bottle stated in part: "CAUTION--Use only 1 capful at most once a day. Greater use may cause severe damage to the scalp." Oscar read the writing on the box, removed the bottle, and threw the box away. Oscar's roommate, Paul, asked to use the No-Flake, and Oscar said, "Be careful not to use too much." Paul thereafter used No-Flake twice a day, applying two or three capfuls each time, notwithstanding the label statement that read: "Use no more than one capful per day. See box instructions." The more he used No-Flake, the more inflamed his scalp became, the more it itched, and the more he used. After three weeks of such use, Paul finally consulted a doctor who diagnosed his problem as a serious and irreversible case of dermatitis caused by excessive exposure to the active ingredients in No-Flake. These ingredients are uniquely effective at controlling dandruff, but there is no way to remove a remote risk to a small percentage of persons who may contract dermatitis as the result of applying for prolonged periods of time amounts of No-Flake substantially in excess of the directions. This jurisdiction adheres to the traditional common-law rules pertaining to contributory negligence and assumption of risk. Based upon the foregoing facts, if Paul sues Shampoo Company to recover damages for his dermatitis, his most promising theory of liability will be that the No-Flake shampoo
1617	A father purchased the largest model rocket that he could find, hoping to interest his daughter in space engineering. Several days later, the father and daughter went to an open area in a state park to fire the rocket. The father was in such a rush to fire the rocket that he failed to remove the safety key from the launch system. Upon connecting the launch system to the rocket motor, the motor exploded, seriously injuring the father and daughter. A negligence action was brought on behalf of the daughter against the rocket manufacturer. At trial, evidence shows that the explosion resulted from a manufacturing defect in the motor. Evidence also shows that the motor would not have exploded while they were connecting the launch system if the father had removed the safety key. Will the daughter recover for her injuries?
1618	A tenant vacated an apartment because he could no longer afford the rent. To ensure that the delinquent tenant made up for past arrearages, the landlord would not let him remove his personal property from the apartment. The tenant found a temporary place to stay with a friend, who wanted to help the tenant get his property back. The tenant remembered that the apartment would be vacant the upcoming weekend and that the landlord would be out of town, so he suggested that they break into the apartment and take the property then. They drove the tenant's pickup to the apartment, and the friend entered through an unlocked window. The friend then opened the door for the tenant, and the pair collected the personal property. While the tenant was getting ready to drive away, the friend returned to the apartment and carried out some of the fixtures to the apartment. At this point, police officers who had been alerted by neighbors arrived and arrested the pair. The tenant's best defense to a charge of burglary would be that:
1619	A federal law provides that all motor vehicle tires discarded in this country must be disposed of in facilities licensed by the federal Environmental Protection Agency. Pursuant to this federal law and all proper federal procedural requirements, that agency has adopted very strict standards for the licensing of such facilities. As a result, the cost of disposing of tires in licensed facilities is substantial. The state of East Dakota has a very large fleet of motor vehicles, including trucks used to support state-owned commercial activities and police cars. East Dakota disposes of used tires from both kinds of state motor vehicles in a state-owned and -operated facility. This state facility is unlicensed, but its operation in actual practice meets most of the standards imposed by the federal Environmental Protection Agency on facilities it licenses to dispose of tires. Consistent with United States Supreme Court precedent, may the state of East Dakota continue to dispose of its used tires in this manner?
1620	A disgruntled customer of a business entered its factory and announced that the products from the factory were terrible. He set off a device that filled the factory with fumes, and then swiftly ran out the main entrance. He rushed past a visitor who was entering the factory, passing just inches in front of her. She was taken aback, which caused her to trip and strike her head on the pavement. The customer was promptly apprehended and charged with the misdemeanor of breach of the peace for his conduct in the factory and charged with assault against the visitor. Which of the following represents the customer's best defense to the charge of assault?
1621	After a sporting event at a stadium, one of the fans sought out the referees to complain about their handling of the game. The fan took out an electronically amplified bullhorn and knocked on the door of the referees' room. When one of the referees opened it, the fan began yelling and berating the referee through the bullhorn. The referee slammed the door shut, striking the bullhorn and jamming it against the fan's mouth, knocking out two of his teeth. If the fan asserts a claim based on battery against the referee and the referee prevails, it will be because:
1622	Owens contracted to sell a tract of land, Overlea, to Painter by general warranty deed. However, at the closing Painter did not carefully examine the deed and accepted a quitclaim deed without covenants of title. Painter later attempted to sell Overlea to Thompson, who refused to perform because Owens had conveyed an easement for a highway across Overlea before Painter bought the property. Painter sued Owens for damages. Which of the following arguments will most likely succeed in Owen's defense?
1623	An expert witness, who has an advanced degree in engineering, is testifying at a jury trial to the possible causes for the failure of an enclosed pedestrian bridge in a shopping mall. Which of the following data, if relied on by the expert witness in forming his opinion, is admissible on direct examination as substantive evidence?
1624	A woman playing tennis with a man became highly irritated because every time she prepared to serve, the man started talking loudly. Despite the woman's repeated requests to stop, the man persisted in the behavior. The woman ran towards the man, swinging her racket to scare him and to get him to stop. However, as she swung the racket, she slipped and it flew out of her hand as she lost her balance. It struck the man's arm, which he had raised to protect himself. The woman slipped because the owner of the tennis court had not cleaned the court properly after some maintenance work. Does the man have grounds for a battery action against the woman?
1625	The defendant was on trial for burglary. At the conclusion of the prosecution's case, the defendant called a neighbor as his first witness. The neighbor testified that the defendant was with him at an out-of-town sporting event at the time of the burglary. On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked the neighbor, "Weren't you on a jury that acquitted the defendant of another criminal charge?" If the judge sustained an objection to this question, the most likely reason would be that:
1626	A group of students held a demonstration against the proliferation of weapons in space in one of the city's parks. The defendant spoke at the demonstration, and to make a point during her speech, she walked over to one of the trash barrels and dumped the contents out on the ground. As she did so, she told her listeners, "This is what outer space is starting to look like, cluttered with the trash of nuclear weapons." The meeting broke up 15 minutes later. The students left the park peacefully, but no one bothered to pick up the trash or right the overturned barrel. The defendant was arrested pursuant to the city's littering ordinance, which carried fines of up to $500 and was strictly enforced. She was convicted and fined $500. If the defendant seeks to have her conviction set aside on constitutional grounds, she is likely to:
1627	Police received information from an undercover police officer that she had just seen two men (whom she described) in a red pickup truck selling marijuana to schoolchildren near the city's largest high school. A few minutes later, two police officers saw a pickup truck fitting the description a half block from the high school. The driver of the truck matched the description of one of the men described by the undercover officer. The only passenger was a young woman who was in the back of the truck. The police saw her get out and stand at a nearby bus stop. They stopped the truck and searched the driver. In the pocket of the driver's jacket, the police found a small bottle of pills that they recognized as narcotics. They then broke open a locked toolbox attached to the flatbed of the truck and found a small sealed envelope inside. They opened it and found marijuana. They also found a quantity of cocaine in the glove compartment. After completing their search of the driver and the truck, the police went over to the young woman and searched her purse. In her purse, they found a small quantity of heroin. Both the driver and the young woman were arrested and charged with unlawful possession of narcotics. If the driver moves to suppress the use as evidence of the marijuana and cocaine found in the search of the truck, the court should
1628	A state statute required that any freight train operating within the city limits be able to stop within 200 yards of applying its brakes. No fixed speed limit was established or particular type of braking mechanism required, but through either lowered speed or braking power, the 200-yard limit was required of all trains. Another statute prohibited vehicles from being within the railroad crossing when the lights on the warning signs are flashing or when the gates are lowered. One day, as a freight train was entering the city limits, the engineer saw a car stalled at a street crossing ahead. He immediately applied full braking power, but was unable to stop the train before it had hit and demolished the car. The driver of the car had gotten clear before the impact, but brought suit against the freight line for property damage to the $25,000 car. At trial, the parties stipulated that the car was stalled within the crossing while the warning lights were flashing. Evidence at trial established that the distance from the pointtat which the engineer applied the train's brakes to the point of impact was 150 yards, and from the braking point to the point at which the train finally stopped was 225 yards. No other evidence of negligence was presented by the driver. At the end of the driver's case, the freight line moved for a directed verdict. Should the court grant the motion?
1629	In a real property dispute over a decedent's vacation home, the plaintiff offers a deed to show that the home had been transferred to her two months before the decedent died. The defendant, the decedent's heir, disputes the plaintiff's claim and alleges that the decedent's signature on the deed was forged. The defendant testifies that he is familiar with the decedent's signature and the signature on the deed is not his. The judge should rule this testimony:
1630	Dix is on trial for killing Vetter. The prosecutor calls Winn to testify that after being shot, Vetter said, "Dix did it." Before the testimony is given, Dix's lawyer asks for a hearing on whether Vetter believed his death was imminent when he made the statement. Before permitting evidence of the dying declaration, the judge should hear evidence on the issue from
1631	The state police wished to infiltrate a racist organization devoted to the goal of creating an "all white America." The police decided to create a new undercover position for the person who would infiltrate the racist organization. The pay was substantially better than the salary of ordinary officers. The chief of police invited all white police officers to apply for the undercover position. A plaintiff had been a state police officer for eight years and had received many citations for efficiency, bravery, and public service. However, the plaintiff is black, and the chief refused to even accept his application for the undercover position, even though the plaintiff told the chief that he was very desirous of obtaining the position. If the plaintiff sues to require the chief to give serious consideration to his application, should the court rule that the chief has acted in a manner in accordance with the principles of the United States Constitution?
1632	A federally owned and operated office building in the state of West Dakota is heated with a new, pollution-free heating system. However, in the coldest season of the year, this new system is sometimes insufficient to supply adequate heat to the building. The appropriation statute providing the money for construction of the new heating system permitted use of the old, pollution-generating system when necessary to supply additional heat. When the old heating system operates (only about two days in any year), the smokestack of the building emits smoke that exceeds the state of West Dakota's pollutioncontrol standards. May the operators of the federal office building be prosecuted successfully by West Dakota authorities for violating that state's pollution control standards?
1633	On November 3, an investor who had watched his stocks sink to unprecedented low levels sent a fax message to a dealer in precious metals: "Please quote your best price on 800 troy ounces platinum bars for immediate delivery at my bank." At 10 a.m. the next morning (November 4) the dealer replied by fax, "My best price is $475 per ounce." The investor received the dealer's message later on that same day. The communications between the investor and the dealer are best characterized as:
1634	A federal criminal law makes it a crime for any citizen of the United States not specifically authorized by the President to negotiate with a foreign government for the purpose of influencing the foreign government in relation to a dispute with the United States. The strongest constitutional grounds for the validity of this law is that
1635	A woman attempted to charge a coat using a credit card that she knew her friend had stolen. The store's electronic credit reporting system indicated the account was defunct, and the store clerk refused to complete the transaction. The woman left the store and held up a couple at gunpoint in a nearby park. However, the couple had just been robbed of all their valuables and was heading over to the police station to report the crime, so the woman got nothing. The woman was arrested and charged with attempting to obtain property by false pretenses and attempted robbery. The court should find the woman:
1636	A developer owns 2,000 acres of land. She wants to develop 1,500 acres as a residential subdivision and hold the remaining 500 acres for a long period, hoping they will appreciate in value. In the meantime, she plans to use the tract as an inducement in the marketing of the lots in the 1,500-acre subdivision by designating the 500 acres as an area in which purchasers in the subdivision can ride horseback, hike, camp, and fish. Business judgment indicates that the developer can make these 500 acres available for these purposes for 20 years if she can be assured that, after such period, she will be free to do with the land as she chooses. The best device to implement the purpose of the developer with respect to the 500 acres (assuming that any device chosen will receive judicial recognition and enforcement) is:
1637	Siddon worked as a private duty nurse and on occasion worked in Doctors' Hospital. The hospital called Registry, the private duty referral agency through which Siddon usually obtained employment, and asked that in the future she not be assigned to patients in Doctors' Hospital. Registry asked the hospital why it had made the request. Doctors' Hospital sent a letter to Registry giving as the reason for its request that significant amounts of narcotics had disappeared during Siddon's shifts from the nursing stations at which she had worked. If Siddon asserts a claim based on defamation against Doctors' Hospital, Siddon will
1638	Defendant was driving his automobile at a legal speed in a residential zone. A child darted out in front of him and was run over and killed before Defendant could prevent it. Defendant's driver's license had expired three months previously; Defendant had neglected to check when it was due to expire. Driving without a valid license is a misdemeanor in the jurisdiction. On a charge of manslaughter, Defendant should be found
1639	An area of grasslands is owned by the United States and is located in the center of a large western state. Acting pursuant to a federal statute authorizing such action, the United States Bureau of Land Management leased the grazing rights in the grasslands to ranchers located nearby. A company owns a vast amount of rangeland adjacent to the grasslands and leases its land for livestock grazing purposes to the same ranchers, but at prices higher than those charged by the Bureau. The company sued the Bureau in an appropriate federal district court to restrain the Bureau from competing with that company by leasing the grasslands. Which of the following constitutional provisions may most easily and directly be used to justify the federal statute authorizing this leasing program of the Bureau of Land Management?
1640	Anna entered into a valid written contract to purchase Blackacre, a large tract of land, from Jones for its fair market value of $50,000. The contract was assignable by Anna. Anna duly notified Jones to convey title to Anna and Charles, Charles being Anna's friend whom Anna had not seen for many years. When Anna learned that Charles would have to sign certain documents in connection with the closing, she prevailed upon her brother, Donald, to attend the closing and pretend to be Charles. Anna and Donald attended the closing, and Jones executed an instrument in the proper form of a deed, purporting to convey Blackacre to Anna and Charles, as tenants in common. Donald pretended that he was Charles, and he signed Charles's name to all the required documents. Anna provided the entire $50,000 consideration for the transaction. The deed was promptly and properly recorded. Unknown to Anna or Donald, Charles had died several months before the closing. Charles's will, which was duly probated, devised "All my real estate to my nephew, Nelson" and the residue of his estate to Anna. Anna and Nelson have been unable to agree as to the status or disposition of Blackacre. Nelson brought an appropriate action against Jones and Anna to quiet legal title to an undivided one-half interest in Blackacre. The court should hold that legal title to Blackacre is vested
1641	Householder resented the fact that joggers and walkers would sometimes come onto his property just beside the sidewalk in order to enjoy the feel of walking or running on grass. He put up a sign, "No Trespassing," but it did not stop the practice. He then put up a sign, "Beware of Skunk," and bought a young skunk. He took the skunk to Dr. Vet to have its scent gland removed. Unfortunately, Dr. Vet did not perform the operation properly, and the scent gland was not removed. Householder was unaware that it had not been removed, One day Walker was out for a stroll. When she came to Householder's property, she walked on the grass alongside the sidewalk on Householder's property. The skunk came up behind Walker and sprayed her with its scent. The smell was overpowering, and she fainted. She struck her head on the sidewalk and suffered serious injuries. If Walker asserts a claim against Dr. Vet, she will
1642	During a gang shootout in a city, a gangbanger looked for a rival among the combatants because he wanted to kill him. Believing a bystander to be the rival, the gangbanger shot at the bystander and missed. The bullet passed through a window and killed a homeowner, who was asleep on her sofa. The gangbanger may properly be convicted of:
1643	Ody, owner of Profitacre, executed an instrument in the proper form of a deed, purporting to convey Profitacre "to Leon for life, then to Ralph in fee simple." Leon, who is Ody's brother and Ralph's father, promptly began to manage Profitacre, which is valuable income-producing real estate. Leon collected all rents and paid all expenses, including real estate taxes. Ralph did not object, and this state of affairs continued for five years until 1987. In that year, Leon executed an instrument in the proper form of a deed, purporting to convey Profitacre to Mona. Ralph, no admirer of Mona, asserted his right to ownership of Profitacre. Mona asserted her ownership and said that if Ralph had any rights he was obligated to pay real estate taxes, even though Leon had been kind enough to pay them in the past. Income from Profitacre is ample to cover expenses, including real estate taxes. In an appropriate action to determine the rights of the parties, the court should decide
1644	The police set up an undercover "sting" operation in which they posed as fences of stolen property and bought and sold such property to anyone who came into their warehouse. A defendant is being prosecuted for receiving stolen property in connection with his arrest by the undercover police officers, and the prosecution attempts to introduce a videotape showing the defendant offering to sell a television set to one of the undercover police officers. If this evidence is held to be inadmissible, the most likely reason is that:
1645	An electronics store located in Los Angeles, California, purchases electronics from an electronics corporation located in San Antonio, Texas. On January 19, the electronics store mailed to the corporation an order for $200,000 worth of electronics, specifying that delivery was to be no later than February 25, F.O.B. South Texas Railroad Depot, San Antonio, Texas. The corporation delivered the electronics to the railroad depot on February 15 and notified the electronics store by fax that its order was scheduled to arrive at the Southern Pacific Railroad Depot in Los Angeles on February 20. On February 17, the corporation learned that the electronics store was insolvent. The corporation demands immediate payment in cash for the electronics. Is this deemed permissible?
1646	A man on probation after pleading guilty to possession of cocaine was suspected of selling cocaine out of his home. His probation officer came to his house and rang the bell. As soon as the man opened the door to see who was there, the officer entered the home, despite the man's protests. After searching the home, the probation officer discovered several bags of marijuana in a drawer. The man was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana with intent to sell. A statute in the jurisdiction in which the search took place provides that, as a condition of probation, a probationer is on notice that his probation officer may conduct a search of the probationer's person or home, without probable cause, at any time of the day or night. The man moved to have evidence of the marijuana suppressed by the court, claiming that the state statute that authorized the search was unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures. Will he prevail?
1647	Congress passed a statute providing that if the President deployed more than 1,000 United States Armed Forces personnel in a foreign country where "combat conditions" existed, the President was required to return such Armed Forces to the United States within 60 days or formally seek a declaration of war from Congress. The statute further provided that, if Congress failed to declare war within 30 days of the President's request, the President was required to return the Armed Forces to the United States. What is Congress's best argument for the constitutionality of the statute?
1648	A pedestrian was lawfully crossing the street when he was struck and seriously injured by a car that had run a red light. At the time, the driver was on his way home from a local tavern. The pedestrian brings suit against the tavern for his injuries, claiming that the driver was permitted to drink too much liquor at the tavern before leaving. The pedestrian calls a witness to the stand. The witness testifies that she and a friend had visited the tavern on the night in question. The witness seeks to testify that she remarked to her friend, "Look at that guy. He's so drunk he can't even stand up." The witness's testimony concerning her remark to her friend is:
1649	A small processor of specialized steel agreed in writing with a small manufacturer of children's toys that it would supply, and the manufacturer would buy, all of the manufacturer's specialized steel requirements over a period of years at a set price per ton of steel. Their contract did not include a nonassignment clause. Recently, the toy manufacturer decided to abandon its line of steel toys, so it made an assignment of its rights and delegation of its duties under the contract to a toymaker many times larger. The large toymaker notified the steel processor of the assignment and relayed to the processor its good faith belief that its requirements will approximate those of the assignor. Must the steel processor supply the requirements of the large toymaker?
1650	A prisoner escaped from prison and stole a car. He picked up a hitchhiker and told her what he had done. Although the hitchhiker was emotionally disturbed and of borderline mental retardation, she understood what the prisoner had done and that the police were after him. The hitchhiker hated the police, and told the prisoner she would do anything she could to help him. To avoid the police, they drove to the mountains, with the prisoner doing much of the driving. With respect to the stolen car, at common law, the hitchhiker is:
1651	A landowner included in his will a provision giving "all of my property, both real and personal, wherever situated, to my widow for life, and after her death to any of our children who may survive her." The gift to the children is:
1652	A lessee rented from the defendant a building containing a store on the ground floor and an apartment above. The lessee operated a jewelry store on the ground floor and lived in the apartment above. One night as the defendant happened by the store, he saw a light on in the shop and, finding the door unlocked, decided to investigate. While looking around the store, the defendant spotted an expensive watch. Recalling that the lessee was much behind in her rent, the defendant decided to take the watch and keep it until the lessee paid the rent. Just as the defendant was leaving the store, the lessee entered the store. Afraid of a confrontation, the defendant tossed the lessee the watch and ran out. The defendant cannot be convicted of common law burglary because:
1653	A state adopted legislation making it a crime to be the biological parent of more than two children. The stated purpose of the statute is to preserve the state's natural resources and improve the quality of life for the state's residents. A married couple has just had their third child. They have been arrested and convicted under the statute. Which of the following is the strongest argument for voiding the convictions of the couple?
1654	While driving east on a two-lane highway, a pickup truck collided with a westbound motorcycle. The accident was observed by a cab driver. Because the cab driver had a passenger, she did not stay at the scene of the accident but made some notes shortly thereafter. She made her statement to the police the next day, in which she stated that just before the accident, the pickup swerved into the westbound lane, hitting the motorcycle. At the trial of the motorcyclist's personal injury action against the truck driver, the cab driver was having difficulty remembering some of the facts. The motorcyclist's attorney sought to let her review the notes she had made. The court should rule this:
1655	Victim, injured by Driver in an auto accident, employed attorney First to represent him in the matter. Victim was chronically insolvent and expressed doubt whether he could promptly get necessary medical treatment. Accordingly, First wrote into their contract his promise to Victim "to pay from any settlementtwith Driver compensation to any physician who provides professional services for Victim's injuries." The contract also provided that First's duties were "'nonassignable." First immediately filed suit against Driver. Victim then sought and received medical treatment, reasonably valued at S1,000, from Doctor, but failed to inform Doctor of First's promise. After receiving a bill from Doctor for $1,000, Victim immediately wrote Doctor explaining that he was unable to pay and enclosing a copy of his contract with First. Victim then asked First about payment of this bill, but First requested a release from their employment contract. stating that he would like to refer Victim's claim to attorney Second and that Second was willing to represent Victim in the pending lawsuit. Victim wrote a letter to First releasing him from their contract and agreeing to Second's representation. A copy of this letter was sent to Doctor. Second subsequently promised First to represent Victim and soon negotiated a settlement of Victim's claim against Driver which netted $1,000, all of which was paid by Victim to creditors other than Doctor. Victim remains insolvent. In an action by Doctor against First upon First's employment contract with Victim, First is likely to argue in defense that
1656	Jones wanted to kill Adams because he believed Adams was having an affair with Jones's wife. Early one morning, armed with a pistol, he crouched behind some bushes on a park hillside overlooking a path upon which Adams frequently jogged. On this morning, however, Jones saw Adams jogging on another path about a half mile away. Nonetheless, Jones fired five shots at Adams. None of the five shots came anywhere close to Adams as he was well out of the range of the pistol Jones was using. Jones is
1657	A college student assigned her apartment rental lease, by written agreement, to one of her sorority sisters. The sorority sister, in turn, assigned the lease to a classmate. If the classmate fails to pay the rent, can the landlord bring suit against the sorority sister to recover this money?
1658	Several members of a small terrorist group are on trial in federal court for conspiring to bomb a military installation. The prosecution would like to introduce the testimony of a military guard at one of the installation's gates. The guard had been present when a bomb that was being planted by a member of the group had exploded prematurely. The guard will testify that she ran over to administer first aid to the member, who in great pain told her that his group was in the process of planting three other bombs in other areas of the military installation and was going to detonate them all at the same time to get publicity for their cause. The guard will also testify that the member disclosed the locations of the other bombs and the names of two other members of the group. The authorities were able to prevent the other bombings and arrest the other members of the group. The member died from his injuries. What is the best basis for allowing the guard to testify as to the member's statements?
1659	Defendant was prosecuted for bankruptcy fraud. Defendant's wife, now deceased, had testified adversely to Defendant during earlier bankruptcy proceedings that involved similar issues. Although the wife had been crossexamined, no serious effort was made to challenge her credibility despite the availability of significant impeachment information. At the fraud trial, the prosecutor offers into evidence the testimony given by Defendant's wife at the bankruptcy proceeding. This evidence should be
1660	Price sued Derrick for injuries Price received in an automobile accident. Price claimed Derrick was negligent in (a) exceeding the posted speed limit of 35 m.p.h., (b) failing to keep a lookout, and (c) crossing the center line. Derrick testified in his own behalf that he was going 30 m.p.h. On cross-examination, Price's counsel did not question Derrick with regard to his speed. Subsequently, Price's counsel calls Officer to testify that, in his investigation following the accident, Derrick told him he was driving 40 m.p.h. Officer's testimony is
1661	Diner, a drive-in hamburger and ice cream stand, recently opened for business in the suburban town of Little City. Diner's business hours are from 9:00 a.m. to midnight. It is in an area that for fifteen years has been zoned for small retail businesses, apartment buildings, and one- and two-family residences. The zoning code specifies that "small retail businesses" include "businesses where food and drink are dispensed for consumption on the premises." Diner was the first drive-in in Little City. For seven years Mr. and Mrs. Householder have owned and lived in their single-family residence, which is across the street from Diner. On opening day a brass band played in the parking lot of Diner until midnight, and the noise of cars and the unusual activity as a result of the new business prevented the Householders from getting to sleep until well after midnight, long after their usual time. Diner is heavily patronized during the day and night by high school students. The noise of cars, the lights of the cars, the lights illuminating the parking lot at Diner, and the noise from the loudspeaker of the ordering system prevented the Householders from sleeping before midnight. Paper cups, napkins, and other items from the drive-in are regularly blown into the Householders' front yard by the prevailing wind. The traffic to and from Diner is so heavy on the street in front of their house that the Householders are afraid to allow their small children to play in the front yard. The Householders have asserted a claim against Diner based on private nuisance. The most likely effect of the fact that Householders were in the area before Diner is that it
1662	An amateur sculptor ordered from an art museum's gift shop a miniature reproduction of a favorite statue, which the museum's flyer indicated was for sale only at the gift shop. He sent the museum an order form printed from its website and a check to cover the cost of the statue. The museum received and processed his order, but by mistake sent, by common carrier, a reproduction of a different statue. The statue was stolen from the carrier en route to the sculptor's home. Between the buyer and the museum, who bears the loss?
1663	A developer purchased a vacant site next to a boutique shop in a downtown area. Two months after the developer constructed a parking garage on the site, the boutique owner noticed that cracks were beginning to appear in the basement and along some of the walls of her shop. A city engineer inspected the premises and told the boutique owner that the land under her building was subsiding. The boutique owner consulted a contractor who told her it would cost $50,000 to repair the damage and that the damage would not have occurred but for the developer's construction of a large structure on the adjacent site. If the boutique owner brings suit against the developer for damages, the boutique owner will:
1664	The defendant is charged with the murder of his accountant. At trial, the prosecution calls as a witness the defendant's business partner, who testifies that he overheard a telephone conversation between the defendant and the accountant, in which the accountant threatened to report him to the I.R.S. for cheating on his income tax return. The defendant's attorney objects to the business partner's testimony on the ground that it is hearsay. The judge should:
1665	The federal Fair Opportunity Act provided that an employer whose products are in any way used by or sold to the federal government must meet certain very specific standards for the hiring of women in traditional male jobs. One city has since enacted an ordinance requiring that any employer doing business with the city have a workforce consonant with the gender composition of the population of the city. A private janitorial service located in the city does contract cleaning for both the city jail and some local federal government offices. The gender makeup of the company's workforce violates the city's ordinance but is in compliance with the federal Fair Opportunity Act. The janitorial service brings an action in state court to enjoin enforcement of the city ordinance. It argues that the local rule is invalid since it conflicts with the federal statute by creating more stringent standards. The trial court should rule:
1666	The legislature of a state enacted a statute that provides for loaning certain textbooks on secular subjects to students in all public and private schools. In accordance with the statute, the state board of education distributed textbooks to a private school that offers religious instruction and admits only Caucasian students. Which of the following is the strongest argument against the constitutionality of free distribution of textbooks to the students at the private school?
1667	In a jurisdiction that has abolished the felony-murder rule, but otherwise follows the common law of murder, Sally and Ralph, both armed with automatic weapons, went into a bank to rob it. Ralph ordered all the persons in the bank to lie on the floor. When some were slow to obey, Sally, not intending to hit anyone, fired about 15 rounds into the air. One of these ricocheted off a stone column and struck and killed a customer in the bank. Sally and Ralph were charged with murder of the customer. Which of the following is correct?
1668	The United States Department of the Interior granted Concessionaire the food and drink concession in a federal park located in the state of New Senora. Concessionaire operated his concession out of federally owned facilities in the park. The federal statute authorizing the Interior Department to grant such concessions provided that the grantees would pay only a nominal rental for use of these federal facilities because of the great benefit their concessions would provide to the people of the United States. The legislature of the state of New Senora enacted a statute imposing an occupancy tax on the occupants of real estate within that state that is not subject to state real estate taxes. The statute was intended to equalize the state tax burden on such occupants with that on people occupying real estate that is subject to state real estate taxes. Pursuant to that statute, the New Senora Department of Revenue attempted to collect the state occupancy tax from Concessionaire because the federal facilities occupied by Concessionaire were not subject to state real estate taxes. Concessionaire sued to invalidate the state occupancy tax as applied to him. The strongest ground upon which Concessionaire could challenge the occupancy tax is that it violates the
1669	When the defendant learned that his former wife, to whom he was paying $1,000 per month in alimony, was dating someone else, the defendant encouraged her to get married "for the sake of the children." The former wife said that she would consider it, but she also expressed concern that her boyfriend might already be married. The defendant told his former wife that he would have an acquaintance run a computer check on the boyfriend that would reveal whether he was currently married. However, the defendant did not bother with the computer check; instead he called the boyfriend and offered him $5,000 if he would propose to the defendant's former wife. The defendant then told his former wife that, according to official records, the boyfriend was single. The defendant's former wife and the boyfriend went through a wedding ceremony shortly thereafter. The boyfriend, however, was already married to someone else, a fact that would have been disclosed by a routine check of official records. If the defendant is charged with being an accessory to bigamy, a strict liability offense in the jurisdiction, he should be found:
1670	Kabb, the owner of a fleet of taxis, contracted with Petrol, a dealer in petroleum products, for the purchase and sale of Kabb's total requirements of gasoline and oil for one year. As part of that agreement, Petrol also agreed with Kabb that for one year Petrol would place all his advertising with Ada Artiste, Kabb's wife, who owned her own small advertising agency. When Artiste was informed of the Kabb-Petrol contract, she declined to accept an advertising account from the Deturgid Soap Company because she could not handle both the Petrol and Deturgid accounts during the same year. For this question only, make the following assumptions. Artiste was an intended beneficiary under the Kabb-Petrol contract. Kabb performed his contract with Petrol for six months, and during that time Petrol placed his advertising with Artiste. At the end of the six months, Kabb and Artiste were divorced, and Kabb then told Petrol that he had no further obligation to place his advertising with Artiste. Petrol thereupon notified Artiste that he would no longer place his advertising with her. In an action against Petrol for breach of contract, Artiste probably will
1671	A motorist driving her brand new SUV was exceeding the posted speed limit by 15 m.p.h. on a curving road when she lost control. The vehicle rolled over, causing her to suffer severe injuries. She brought an action against the manufacturer of the SUV based on strict liability in tort. At trial, the facts of the accident were entered into evidence. The motorist also presented expert testimony that stability control technology, which was available in other similar sized SUVs, could have been incorporated into the model she owned and likely would have prevented the vehicle from tipping over. The manufacturer presented evidence that incorporating the stability control technology would have added almost $2,000 to the cost of manufacturing each vehicle. At the close of all of the evidence, the manufacturer moved for a directed verdict. The manufacturer's motion should be:
1672	Dray was prosecuted for bank robbery. At trial, the bank teller, Wall, was unable to identify Dray, now bearded, as the bank robber. The prosecutor then showed Wall a group of photographs, and Wall testified that she had previously told the prosecutor that the middle picture (concededly a picture of Dray before he grew a beard) was a picture of the bank robber. Wall's testimony is
1673	Fruitko, Inc., ordered from Orchard, Inc., 500 bushels of No. 1 Royal Fuzz peaches, at a specified price, "for prompt shipment." Orchard promptly shipped 500 bushels, but by mistake shipped No. 2 Royal Fuzz peaches instead of No. 1. The error in shipment was caused by the negligence of Orchard's shipping clerk. Which of the following best states Fruitko's rights and duties upon delivery of the peaches?
1674	On November 5, an electronics store owner realized that his stock of 15 of the most popular video game of the holiday shopping season would not last until the first of the next month. Seeing an advertisement from the manufacturer of the game in a trade journal listing its price at $3,000 per hundred, with delivery one week from order, the store owner faxed to the manufacturer an order for 100 copies of the game at $3,000 per hundred. There were no further communications between the store owner and the manufacturer. By November 25, the store owner realized that the manufacturer was not going to deliver any of the video games. He thus was forced to obtain additional stock by purchasing from a middleman at a cost of $4,000 per hundred. The store owner brings an action for breach of contract against the manufacturer. Who will prevail?
1675	A newly-enacted state criminal statute provides, in its entirety, "No person shall utter to another person in a public place any annoying, disturbing or unwelcome language." Smith followed an elderly woman for three blocks down a public street, yelling in her ear offensive four-letter words. The woman repeatedly asked Smith to leave her alone, but he refused. In the subsequent prosecution of Smith, the first under this statute, Smith
1676	A state statute prohibits aliens from owning land and makes it illegal to sell land to aliens. A landowner who entered into a contract to sell property to an alien brought an action to challenge the statute. The alien, however, did not participate in the action. The landowner's strongest constitutional argument against the validity of the statute is that:
1677	A woman was crossing the street at a crosswalk, but did not look both ways. The woman was hit by a truck, and immediately afterwards, she was struck by a car. As a result of these collisions with the vehicles, the woman suffered severe injuries. Although it was impossible to determine which portion of the woman's injuries was caused by the driver of the car and which was caused by the truck driver, at the trial of the woman's suit, the jury determined that the driver of the car was 20% negligent, that the truck driver was 40% negligent, and that the woman was 40% negligent. It was further determined that the woman had suffered $100,000 in damages. The woman had already received $10,000 from her group medical insurance plan. The driver of the car had a $500,000 auto liability insurance policy, and the truck driver is now insolvent. How much will the woman recover in damages from the driver of the car?
1678	Two friends entered a bar looking to get money to pay off a loan shark, but with no plan how to do so. They struck up conversations with two women. The first friend left the bar, having induced one of the women to return home with him. Once in his house, the first friend told the woman that she would not be allowed to leave unless she gave him all of her money. Fearing for her safety, the woman gave him all of the cash she had in her possession. Meanwhile, the second friend remaining at the bar noticed that the other woman left her credit card on the counter. When the woman looked away, the friend picked up the credit card and put it into his pocket. Shortly thereafter, the woman realized her card was gone and accused the man of taking it. The man pretended to be insulted, slapped the victim, and went off with the credit card in his pocket. Which of the two friends can be convicted for common law robbery?
1679	Peter was rowing a boat on a mountain lake when a storm suddenly arose. Fearful that the boat might sink, Peter rowed to a boat dock on shore and tied the boat to the dock. The shore property and dock were the private property of Owner. While the boat was tied at the dock, Owner came down and ordered Peter to remove the boat, because the action of the waves was causing the boat to rub against a bumper on the dock. When Peter refused, Owner untied the boat and cast it adrift. The boat sank. Peter was wearing a pair of swimming trunks nothing else. He had a pair of shoes and a parka in the boat, but they were lost when Owner set it adrift. Peter was staying at a cabin one mile from Owner's property. The only land routes back were a short rocky trail that was dangerous during the storm, and a 15-mile road around the lake. The storm continued with heavy rain and hail, and Peter having informed Owner of the location of his cabin, asked Owner to take him back there in Owner's car. Owner said, " You got here by yourself and you'll have to get back home yourself." After one hour the storm stopped, and Peter walked home over the trail. A necessary element in determining if Peter is liable for a trespass is whether
1680	The state passed a law stating that "only persons living with their parents or guardians who are bona fide residents of the state shall be entitled to free public education; all others who wish to attend public schools within the state may do so, but they must pay tuition of $3,000 per semester." A 15-year-old girl moved in with her friend so that she could attend the public schools in the state, and the state legislature passed the tuition statute just as she completed her junior year. The girl wants to complete her senior year in the state high school, but cannot afford to pay tuition. If the girl sues in federal court to strike down the tuition statute, the court is likely to rule that the statute is:
1681	Sam and two of his friends were members of a teenage street gang. While they were returning from a dance late one evening, their car collided with a car driven by an elderly woman. After an argument, Sam attacked the elderly woman with his fists and beat her to death. Sam's two friends watched, and when they saw the woman fall to the ground they urged Sam to flee. Sam was eventually apprehended and tried for manslaughter, but the jury could not decide on a verdict. If Sam's companions are subsequently tried as accomplices to manslaughter, they should be
1682	Acting on an anonymous telephone call, police went to the defendant's apartment, knocked on the door, and demanded to search it for narcotics. When the defendant refused, the police forced the door open and placed him under arrest. As they were removing him from the apartment, the defendant offered to give the officers "valuable information" in exchange for his release. Before he could say anything else, the defendant was given Miranda warnings by the police. Thereafter, he told the police that he had stored some heroin in his friend's apartment and that he and his friend had been going to sell it. The heroin was recovered, and the defendant was prosecuted for conspiracy to sell narcotics and for possession of narcotics. At his trial, the defendant moved to suppress his statements. Which of the following is the defendant's best argument in support of the motion to suppress?
1683	Smart approached Johnson and inquired about hiring someone to kill his girlfriend's parents. Unknown to Smart, Johnson was an undercover police officer who pretended to agree to handle the job and secretly taped subsequent conversations with Smart concerning plans and payment. A few days before the payment was due, Smart changed his mind and called the plan off. Nevertheless, Smart was charged with solicitation to commit murder. Smart should be
1684	A farmer owned land in fee simple. He executed two deeds, the first conveying an undivided one-half interest in the land to a husband and a wife as joint tenants with right of survivorship, and the second conveying an undivided one-half interest in the land to the husband's only child. The child was 13 years old at the time. The common law joint tenancy is unmodified by statute. The farmer handed the two deeds to the husband. The husband promptly and properly recorded the deed to himself and his wife and put the deed to his child in a safedeposit box without recording it. No actual consideration was paid for the deeds. The same year, the husband, the wife, and the child were killed simultaneously in an airplane crash. They all died intestate. The applicable statute in the jurisdiction provides that "when title to property or its devolution depends on priority of death and there is insufficient evidence that the persons have died otherwise than simultaneously, the property of each person shall be disposed of as if he had survived." An appropriate action was instituted by the heirs of the husband, the wife, and the child. The farmer, who is not an heir of any of the deceased, is a party to the action. The court should determine that title to the land is:
1685	Road Lines is an interstate bus company operating in a five-state area. A federal statute authorizes the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to permit interstate carriers to discontinue entirely any unprofitable route. Road Lines applied to the ICC for permission to drop a very unprofitable route through the sparsely populated Shaley Mountains. The ICC granted that permission even though Road Lines provided the only public transportation into the region. Foley is the owner of a mountain resort in the Shaley Mountains, whose customers usually arrived on vehicles operated by Road Lines. After exhausting all available federal administrative remedies, Foley filed suit against Road Lines in the trial court of the state in which the Shaley Mountains are located to enjoin the discontinuance by Road Lines of its service to that area. Foley alleged that the discontinuance of service by Road Lines would violate a statute of that state prohibiting common carriers of persons from abandoning service to communities having no alternate form of public transportation. The state court should
1686	In contract litigation between Pixley and Dill, a fact of consequence to the determination of the action is whether Pixley provided Dill with a required notice at Dill's branch office "in the state capital." Pixley introduced evidence that he gave notice at Dill's office in the city of Capitan. Although Capitan is the state's capital, Pixley failed to offer proof of that fact. Which of the following statements is most clearly correct with respect to possible judicial notice of the fact that Capitan is the state's capital?
1687	A young prosecutor was assigned to a widely publicized murder case in which many people believed that the police might have arrested an innocent person for the crime. After interviewing the defendant and reviewing the files, the prosecutor agreed with that opinion, and told her supervising attorney that she thought that the defendant was innocent. The supervisor instructed the prosecutor to keep her opinions to herself, put on the best case she could, and let the jury decide the issue of guilt. At the first hearing of the case, the prosecutor told the judge that, in her opinion, the defendant was innocent. Immediately after the hearing, the supervising attorney fired the prosecutor for insubordination. After exhausting all administrative remedies available to her, the prosecutor filed suit in federal court, claiming that her firing violated the First Amendment because it was triggered by her expression of belief on a matter of public concern. How should the court rule?
1688	A man was engaged in a telephone conversation with his son. At one point in the conversation, he said to his son, "My accountant is at my door. I'll have to hang up. Talk to you later." The next morning, the man's housekeeper found him dead and obviously the victim of foul play. The accountant was arrested and charged with the murder. The prosecution seeks to have the son testify at the accountant's trial as to his telephone conversation with his father. The prosecution's attempt is met by an objection from the defense. How should the court rule on the son's testimony?
1689	Congress created a seven-member safety commission to investigate and make recommendations to Congress for new fireworks safety laws, to make further rules for establishing safety and performance standards, and to prosecute violations of these safety standards. The chairman of the commission was appointed by the President. Three members were selected by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and three members were selected by the President pro tempore of the Senate. An organization with proper standing seeks to enjoin enforcement of the commission's rules. Which of the following presents the strongest constitutional argument that the organization can make against the validity of the commission?
1690	Defendant, a worker in a metalworking shop, had long been teasing Vincent, a young colleague, by calling him insulting names and ridiculing him. One day Vincent responded to the teasing by picking up a metal bar and attacking Defendant. Defendant could have escaped from the shop. He parried the blow with his left arm, and with his right hand struck Vincent a blow on his jaw from which the young man died. 282. Patty sued Mart Department Store for personal injuries, alleging that while shopping she was knocked to the floor by a merchandise cart being pushed by Handy, a stock clerk, and that as a consequence her back was injured. Handy testified that Patty fell near the cart but was not struck by it. Thirty minutes after Patty's fall, Handy, in accordance with regular practice at Mart, filled out a printed form, "Employee's Report of Accident-Mart Department Store," in which he stated that Patty had been leaning over to spank her young child and in so doing had fallen near his cart. Counsel for Mart offers in evidence the report, which was given to him by Handy's supervisor. The judge should rule the report offered by Mart
1691	A bicycle shop proprietor and a customer entered into a valid contract under which the customer was to purchase a racing bicycle to be delivered on May 20. The contract provided that the bicycle was to be delivered to the customer's nephew as a birthday present. The proprietor sent a photocopy of the contract to the nephew, which the nephew received on May 4. In anticipation of receiving the new bicycle, the nephew immediately donated his old bicycle to a charitable organization. On May 15, the customer told the proprietor that he wanted to cancel the contract for the bicycle. The proprietor assented and promptly sold the bicycle to another customer at twice the price. The nephew called the bicycle shop when the bicycle was not delivered on May 20 and was told of the cancellation of the contract. Can the nephew compel the customer to honor the original contract or pay him damages?
1692	A student started a small fire in a trash can in the men's room at his university. His plan was to set off the school's fire alarms so that he could break into the computer lab and steal a laptop computer while the building was being evacuated. The student was stopped after he had set the fire and was attempting to smash in the glass on the computer lab door. The fire was quickly extinguished and no serious damage was done to the building by the fire beyond some charring on the walls in one stall of the men's room. A statute in the jurisdiction extends the crime of arson to buildings other than dwellings. Which of the following best describes the crimes of which the student could be properly convicted?
1693	Owen held in fee simple Farmdale, a large tract of vacant land. The state wherein Farmdale is situated has a statute which provides, in substance, that unless the conveyance is recorded, every deed orother conveyance of an interest in land is void as to a subsequent purchaser who pays value without notice of such conveyance. The following transactions occurred in the order given. First: Owen conveyed Farmdale, for a fair price, to Allred by general warranty deed. Allred did not immediately record. Second: Owen executed a mortgage to secure repayment of a loan concurrently made to Owen by Leon. Leon had no notice of the prior conveyance to Allred and promptly duly recorded the mortgage. Third: Owen, by general warranty deed, gratuitously conveyed to Niece, who promptly duly recorded this deed. Fourth: Allred duly recorded his deed from Owen. Fifth: Niece, by general warranty deed, conveyed Farmdale to Barrett. Barrett had no actual notice of any of the prior transactions, paid full value, and promptly duly recorded the deed. Assume for this question only that Niece had not conveyed to Barrett. After Allred recorded his deed from Owen. Allred, asserting that Allred's title was held free of any claim by Niece, instituted suit against Niece to recover title to Farmdale. Judgment should be for
1694	Bill and Chuck hated Vic and agreed to start a fight with Vic and, if the opportunity arose, to kill him. Bill and Chuck met Vic in the street outside a bar and began to push him around. Ray, Sam, and Tom. who also hated Vic, stopped to watch. Ray threw Bill a knife. Sam told Bill, ''Kill him." Tom. who made no move and said nothing, hoped that Bill would kill Vic with the knife. Chuck held Vic while Bill stabbed and killed him. On a charge of murdering Vic, Sam is
1695	Pack sued Donlon for slander, alleging that Donlon had publicly accused Pack of being a thief. In his answer, Donlon admitted making the accusation, but alleged that it was a true statement. At trial, Donlon offers evidence that Pack stole a ring worth $10,000 from a jewelry store. Evidence concerning this theft should be
1696	Dever drove his car into an intersection and collided with a fire engine that had entered the intersection from Dever's right. The accident was caused by negligence on Dever's part. As a result of the accident, the fire engine was delayed in reaching Peters' house, which was entirely consumed by fire. Peters' house was located about ten blocks from the scene of the accident. If Peters asserts a claim against Dever, Peters will recover
1697	The state of Orrington wanted to prevent its only major league baseball team, the privately owned and operated Orrington Opossums, from moving to the rival state of Atrium. After a heated political debate in the legislature, Orrington enacted legislation providing for a one-time grant of $10 million in state funds to the Opossums to cover part of the projected income losses the team would suffer during the next five years if it remained in that state. The legislation required that the team remain in the state for at least ten years if it accepted the grant. After accepting the grant, the owners of the Opossums decided to build a new $150 million stadium in Orrington. As plans for the construction of the new stadium proceeded, it became evident that all of the contractors and subcontractors would be white males, and that they had been chosen by the owners of the Opossums without any public bids because these contractors and subcontractors had successfully built the only other new baseball stadium in the region. Several contractors who were females or members of minority racial groups filed suit against the owners of the Opossums in federal district court to compel public solicitation of bids for the construction of its new stadium on an equal opportunity basis, and to enjoin construction of the stadium until compliance was ensured. Their only claim was that the contracting practices of the owners of the Opossums denied them the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. In this suit, the court will probably rule that
1698	Pursuant to statute, a state's department of education provides model lesson plans to any school or school district in the state requesting such plans. A private religious school whose curriculum is more than 50% religious matters applied for and received model lesson plans for the nonreligious subjects taught in its classrooms. Which of the following is the best argument supporting the constitutionality of the state's statutory policy of providing model lesson plans to this private religious school?
1699	Sand Company operated an installation for distributing sand and gravel. The installation was adjacent to a residential area. On Sand's grounds there was a chute with polished metal sides for loading sand and gravel into trucks. The trucks being loaded stopped on the public street below the chute. After closing hours, a plywood screen was placed in the chute and the ladder used for inspection was removed to another section of the installation. For several months, however, a number of children, 8 to 10 years of age, had been playing on Sand's property and the adjoining street after closing hours. The children found the ladder and also discovered that they could remove the plywood screen from the chute and slide down to the street below. Sand knew of this activity. One evening, the children were using the chute as a play device. As an automobile driven by Commuter approached the chute, Ladd, an 8-year-old boy, slid down just in front of the automobile. Commuter applied her brakes, but they suddenly failed, and she hit and injured Ladd. Commuter saw the child in time to have avoided hitting him if her brakes had worked properly. Two days previously, Commuter had taken her car to Garage to have her brakes inspected. Garage inspected the brakes and told her that the brakes were in perfect working order. Claims were asserted on behalf of Ladd by his proper legal representative against Sand, Commuter, and Garage. On Ladd's claim against Garage, will Ladd prevail?
1700	The owner and manager of a large office building contracted its elevator maintenance to an elevator repair company that did not have a good reputation for safety. One of its employees incorrectly set a switch while repairing an elevator. As a result, the elevator dropped suddenly when an office worker in the building used it the next day. The worker sued the elevator company in a jurisdiction that has adopted comparative contribution rules but has retained joint and several liability. The trier of fact determined that the elevator company was 70% at fault and the building owner was 30% at fault in causing the worker's damages. After the worker had obtained a full recovery of his damages from the elevator company, the company sued the building owner to obtain reimbursement for the damages it paid to the worker. The company should recover from the building owner:
1701	By warranty deed, Marta conveyed Blackacre to Beth and Christine "as joint tenants with right of survivorship." Beth and Christine are not related. Beth conveyed all her interest to Eugenio by warranty deed and subsequently died intestate. Thereafter, Christine conveyed to Darin by warranty deed. There is no applicable statute, and the jurisdiction recognizes the common-law joint tenancy. Title to Blackacre is in
1702	For this question only, make the following assumptions. On March 1, Fixtures tendered 24 sets to Apartments and explained, "One of the 25 sets was damaged in transit from the manufacturer to us, but we will deliver a replacement within 5 days." Which of the following statements is correct?
1703	A homeowner lived in a house on a large corner lot located a few hundred feet from a convenience store that was frequented by many people in the neighborhood. Everyone took a shortcut across the homeowner's front yard rather than staying on the sidewalk that bordered her lawn. The heavy foot traffic wore a path through her lawn, and people left soft drink cans and candy wrappers strewn all over her front yard. Fed up, the homeowner hired a local contractor to build a fence around her front lawn. The next afternoon, the contractor started the job by surveying the property and digging post holes, but left to do another small job in that area. He left behind a wheelbarrow with a shovel leaning against it. After noticing the items, the homeowner called the contractor's office and spoke to his wife. The contractor's wife said that he was on another job in the area and would pick up the wheelbarrow and shovel on his way back, but he never did. A neighbor who was walking to the convenience store to pick up a six-pack of beer after work took his usual shortcut when he came to the neighbor's corner. As he was walking by the wheelbarrow, a police car with siren wailing went by on the main street, distracting him. As he followed the police car with his eyes, he tripped over the shovel leaning against the wheelbarrow and fell, breaking his arm. Is the homeowner liable to the neighbor for his broken arm and related damages?
1704	A freelance professional photographer was purchasing film at a store when he noticed that a well-known actress was browsing through th store's clothing department. He took a photograph of the actress in the store without her knowledge. Several days later, the photographe sold the photograph to the manager of the store explaining that the actress had agreed that the store could use the photograph in an advertisin campaign. The manager enlarged the photogra and hung it above the main entrance with a caption stating that the actress shops at the stor One month earlier, the actress had entered into a contract with a competing store, the terms of which provided that the competing store had th exclusive right to use her name and likeness for advertising purposes. If the actress asserts a claim based on invasion of privacy against the store, will she prevail?
1705	Homeowner owns a house on a lake. Neighbor owns a house across a driveway from Homeowner's property. Neighbor's house sits on a hill and Neighbor can see the lake from his living room window. Homeowner and Neighbor got into an argument and Homeowner erected a large spotlight on his property that automatically comes on at dusk and goes off at sunrise. The only reason Homeowner installed the light was to annoy Neighbor. The glare from the light severely detracts from Neighbor's view of the lake. In a suit by Neighbor against Homeowner, will Neighbor prevail?
1706	In which of the following cases is Morrow most likely to be convicted if she is charged with receiving stolen property?
1707	A statute in the jurisdiction defines murder in the first degree as knowingly killing another person after deliberation. Deliberation is defined as "cool reflection for any length of time no matter how brief." Murder in the second degree is defined as "all other murder at common law except felony-murder." Felony-murder is murder in the third degree. Manslaughter is defined by the common law. At 2 a.m., Duncan held up an all-night liquor store using an assault rifle. During the holdup, two police cars with flashing lights drove up in front of the store. In order to create a situation where the police would hesitate to come into the store (and thus give Duncan a chance to escape out the back) Duncan fired several rounds through the front window of the store. Duncan then ran out the back but upon discovering another police car there, surrendered quietly. One of the shots he fired while in the store struck and killed a burglar who was stealing items from a closed store across the street. The most serious degree of criminal homicide Duncan is guilty of is
1708	A woman was arrested, given Miranda warnings, and questioned about an armed robbery. After she asked to speak with an attorney, the police stopped questioning her about the robbery. Several hours later, the police gave the woman a fresh set of Miranda warnings and began to question her about a different robbery. She did not repeat her request for an attorney and instead made several incriminating statements about the robbery. At the woman's trial for the robbery for which she made incriminating statements, the prosecution seeks to have her statements introduced into evidence. If the woman's attorney objects on appropriate grounds, the court should:
1709	A defendant was charged with robbing and murdering a store clerk. A security camera had recorded the incident, clearly showing that the defendant shot the store clerk at point blank range, and that the defendant dropped the handgun immediately after shooting the store clerk. The gun, with the defendant's fingerprints on it, was recovered. Two eyewitnesses also were able to conclusively identify the defendant as the robber/murderer. After the defendant had been validly arrested, the police conducted a warrantless search of the defendant's home, and several items from the store were found. The items from the store were introduced at trial over the defendant's objection. The defendant was convicted after a nonjury trial. On appeal, the appellate court ruled that the warrantless search was unconstitutional under the circumstances. Must the appellate court also overturn the defendant's conviction?
1710	A shopping center contracted with a security service to provide nighttime monitoring of mall property. An employee of the security service, without the manager's permission, began placing several of his pet rattlesnakes in the shopping center at night as a deterrent to burglars, and posted signs at night saying, "Beware of poisonous snakes." The shopping center was conducting a contest to guess the number of jelly beans that filled a car. A student at a local college broke into the shopping center to take a sample of the jelly beans in a given volume of the car's interior so that, using the manufacturer's figures for interior volume, he could calculate the number of beans in the car. As the student was carefully opening a vent window to take his sample of jelly beans, one of the security service employee's rattlers that had been lying under the car bit him on the ankle. The student, who had not seen the warning signs about snakes, was hospitalized for two weeks and had to miss a semester of school as a result of the snakebite. If the student brings an action against the shopping center, will he likely recover?
1711	As a wife was organizing files on the family computer, she discovered emails and photos showing that her husband was having an affair with his secretary. The wife was incensed, so she went to a drawer where she knew her husband kept his handgun and, assuming it was loaded because he always told her that it was, headed off to her husband's office with the intent to do away with his secretary. When the wife arrived, she burst into the office, pulled the gun out of her purse, and pointed it at the secretary. However, when the wife pulled the trigger, nothing happened, because the handgun contained no ammunition. The jurisdiction's criminal code defines assault as "(1) an attempt to commit a battery; or (2) the intentional creation of a reasonable apprehension in the mind of the victim of imminent bodily harm." The code uses the common law definitions of homicide crimes. Of which of the following crimes could the wife be convicted?
1712	Post sued Dint for dissolution of their yearlong partnership. One issue concerned the amount of money Post had received in cash. It was customary for Dint to give Post money from the cash register as Post needed it for personal expenses. Post testified that, as he received money, he jotted down the amounts in the partnership ledger. Although Dint had access to the ledger, he made no changes in it. The ledger was admitted into evidence. Dint seeks to testify to his memory of much larger amounts he had given Post. Dint's testimony is
1713	A landowner provided in his will that his property would pass on his death to his son for life, "then to my eldest grandchild living at my son's death for life, remainder to my greatgrandchildren, share and share alike." When the landowner died, he was survived by his wife, his son, his son's son, his daughter, and his daughter's daughter. The son's son was the eldest of the two grandchildren. After the landowner's death, his son had another child, and his daughter had two more children. When the son died many years later, the son's eldest son had predeceased him, and seven great-grandchildren (of the landowner) had been born. At the son's death, in whom is title to the property vested?
1714	While Patty was riding her horse on what she thought was a public path, the owner of a house next to the path approached her, shaking a stick and shouting, "Get off my property." Unknown to Patty, the path on which she was riding crossed the private property of the shouting owner. When Patty explained that she thought the path was a public trail, the man cursed her, approached Patty's horse, and struck the horse with the stick. As a result of the blow, the horse reared, causing Patty to fear that she would fall. However, Patty managed to stay on the horse, and then departed. Neither Patty nor the horse suffered bodily harm. If Patty brings an action for damages against the property owner, the result should be for
1715	A state passed a law prohibiting liquor manufacturers from falsely advertising or misrepresenting facts about alcohol to the public. A brewery's advertising in the state claimed that its beer had only 45 calories per bottle and was great for individuals trying to lose weight. After performing tests on the beer and finding that it had 145 calories per bottle, the state filed suit against the brewery for violating the state law. The brewery filed a motion to dismiss the state's action, claiming that the state law is unenforceable because it is preempted by the Federal Liquor Labeling Act, which was passed by Congress to inform the public of the health risks of intoxicating liquors and provided that no prohibition based on alcohol and health may be imposed under state law with respect to the advertising or promotion of alcoholic beverages. The motion should be:
1716	Dayton operates a collection agency. He was trying to collect a $400 bill for medical services rendered to Pratt by Doctor. Dayton went to Pratt's house and when Martina, Pratt's mother, answered the door, Dayton told Martina he was there to collect a bill owed by Pratt. Martina told Dayton that because of her illness, Pratt had been unemployed for six months, that she was still ill and unable to work, and that she would pay the bill as soon as she could. Dayton, in a loud voice, demanded to see Pratt and said that if he did not receive payment immediately, he would file a criminal complaint charging her with fraud. Pratt, hearing the conversation, came to the door. Dayton, in a loud voice, repeated his demand for immediate payment and his threat to use criminal process. If Pratt asserts a claim against Dayton, based on infliction of emotional distress, will Pratt prevail?
1717	A contractor for a large multistory building used an excavation subcontractor to dig the excavation for the foundation, and a structural subcontractor to begin structural work on the foundation. Just after the foundation was completed, an employee of the structural subcontractor was killed when the walls of the excavation collapsed. The employee's survivors brought an approprivate action against all of the involved parties. At trial, the structural subcontractor calls a civil engineer licensed by the state to testify that he examined the geologist's reports of the soil conditions surrounding the construction site, as well as a report by the investigator who examined the site of the collapse, and that it is his (the engineer's) opinion that the collapse was caused by the excavation subcontractor's failure to take into consideration the composition of the soil being excavated. Is the engineer's testimony admissible?
1718	An unmarried couple lived together for 10 years as husband and wife. During this time, the woman identified herself as the man's wife, and the couple maintained a joint checking account and filed joint income tax returns as husband and wife. During this period of cohabitation, the man decided to buy a home. The deed identified the grantees as the man and the woman, "his wife, and their heirs and assigns forever as tenants by the entirety." The man made a down payment of $20,000 and executed a mortgage for the unpaid balance. Both he and the woman signed the note for the unpaid balance as husband and wife. The man continued to make the monthly payments as they became due until he and the woman had an argument and decided to separate. The man abandoned the woman and the house. The woman then made the payments for six months. At the end of this period, the woman brought an action against the man for partition of the land in question. The jurisdiction does not recognize common law marriages and has no applicable statute on the subject. The woman's request for partition should be:
1719	Lender met Borrower on the street, demanded that Borrower pay a debt owed to Lender, and threatened to punch Borrower in the nose. A fight ensued between them. Mann came upon the scene just as Lender was about to kick Borrower in the head. Noting that Lender was getting the better of the fight, Mann pointed a gun at Lender and said, "Stop, or I'll shoot." If Lender asserts a claim against Mann based on assault, will Lender prevail?
1720	A plaintiff brought an action against a defendant for property damages, alleging that the defendant's car nicked the side of the plaintiff's truck while the defendant was changing lanes on an expressway. At trial, the defendant sought to introduce evidence of her good driving record. The evidence is:
1721	A pedestrian who was struck by a landowner's automobile was awarded a judgment in the amount of $115,000. The landowner's insurance carrier paid the pedestrian $100,000, leaving a $15,000 outstanding judgment that the landowner was unable to pay. The pedestrian properly filed the judgment with the county recorder's office. A statute of the state in which the landowner's land is located provides: Any judgment against a person properly filed shall attach to all real property owned by that person or acquired by that person within 10 years following the filing of the judgment. The landowner owned an undeveloped lot in co-tenancy with her cousin, each holding an undivided one-half interest. The landowner and the cousin put the property up for sale and conveyed it to a purchaser via quitclaim deed for $20,000. The purchaser gave the landowner and the cousin $10,000 each. The landowner promptly applied her $10,000 toward payment of the unsatisfied judgment. The pedestrian then brought an appropriate action against the cousin, demanding $5,000 from her share of the proceeds of the sale of the lot to satisfy the judgment against the landowner. Will the pedestrian prevail?
1722	A plaintiff was injured as a result of a defendant's negligence. The plaintiff hired an attorney, who sent the plaintiff to see a physician for the purpose of examining the plaintiff prior to trial and assessing the extent of his injuries. During the course of the examination, the plaintiff made some statements to the physician indicating that he was not completely free from negligence when the accident occurred. The defendant seeks to call the physician to testify to the statements the plaintiff made to the physician. The attorney objects. The objection should be:
1723	Eureka, Inc., inventor of the LBVC, a laser-beam vegetable chopper, ran a television ad that described the chopper and said, "The LBVC is yours for only $49.99 if you send your check or money order to Box 007, Greenville. Not available in stores." Gourmet, who owned a retail specialty shop, wrote Eureka, "What's your best firm price for two dozen LBVCs?" Eureka sent a written reply that said in its entirety, "We quote you for prompt acceptance $39.99 per unit for 24 LBVCs." Gourmet subsequently mailed a check to Eureka in the appropriate amount, with a memo enclosed saying, "I accept your offer for 24 LBVCs." A contract would arise from these communications only if
1724	Brown suffered from the delusion that he was a special agent of God. He frequently experienced hallucinations in the form of hearing divine commands. Brown believed God told him several times that the local Roman Catholic bishop was corrupting the diocese into heresy, and that the bishop should be "done away with." Brown, a devout Catholic, conceived of himself as a religious martyr. He knew that shooting bishops for heresy is against the criminal law. He nevertheless carefully planned how he might kill the bishop. One evening Brown shot the bishop, who was taken to the hospital where he died two weeks later. Brown told the police he assumed the institutions of society would support the ecclasiastical hierarchy, and he expected to be persecuted for his God-inspired actions. Psychiatrist Stevens examined Brown and found that Brown suffered from schizophrenic psychosis, that in the absence of this psychosis he would not have shot the bishop, and that because of the psychosis Brown found it extremely difficult to determine whether he should obey the specific command that he do away with the bishop or the general commandment "Thou shalt not kill." Brown was charged with murder. If Brown interposes an insanity defense and the jurisdiction in which he is tried has adopted only the M'Naghten test of insanity, then the strongest argument for the defense under that test is that
1725	A neighbor of a teenager purchased an expensive sports car and parked it in his attached garage. To get into the garage, the teenager manufactured a radio device that could be programmed to activate any automatic garage door opener, and the teenager used the device to open the neighbor's garage one night. The teenager hotwired the car and drove it away, intending to cruise by a few of his friends' favorite bars and then return it to its owner with no one the wiser. After driving the car to a local bar and having several drinks, the teenager decided to take his friends for a ride to the nearby seacoast. When the party arrived at the bluffs above the beach, the teenager impulsively decided to push the car over the cliff. The jurisdiction's penal statutes have codified the common law without alteration of any kind. The teenager is guilty of:
1726	The police had, over time, accumulated reliable information that Jason operated a large cocaine- distribution network, that he and his accomplices often resorted to violence, and that they kept a small arsenal of weapons in his home. One day, the police received reliable information that a large brown suitcase with leather straps containing a supply of cocaine had been delivered to Jason's home and that it would be moved to a distribution point the next morning. The police obtained a valid search warrant to search for and seize the brown suitcase and the cocaine and went to Jason's house. The police knocked on Jason's door and called out, "Police. Open up. We have a search warrant." After a few seconds with no response, the police forced the door open and entered. Hearing noises in the basement, the police ran down there and found Jason with a large brown suitcase with leather straps. They seized the suitcase and put handcuffs on Jason. A search of his person revealed a switchblade knife and a .45-caliber pistol. Jason cursed the police and said, "You never would have caught me with the stuff if it hadn't been for that lousy snitch Harvey!" The police then fanned out through the house, looking in every room and closet. They found no one else, but one officer found an Uzi automatic weapon in a box on a closet shelf in Jason's bedroom. In addition to charges relating to the cocaine in the suitcase, Jason is charged with unlawful possession of weapons. Jason moves pretrial to suppress the use as evidence of the weapons seized by the police and of the statement he made. As to the Uzi automatic weapon, Jason's motion to suppress should be
1727	Phil is suing Dennis for injuries suffered in an automobile collision. At trial Phil's first witness, Wanda, testified that, although she did not see the accident, she heard her friend Frank say just before the crash, "Look at the crazy way old Dennis is driving!" Dennis offers evidence to impeach Frank by asking Wanda, "Isn't it true that Frank beat up Dennis just the day before the collision?" The question is
1728	A man and a woman, once married to each other, had gone through a bitter divorce. The divorce decree awarded custody of the couple's four-year-old son to the woman, with the man receiving visitation rights. On the first opportunity that the man had to take his son for the weekend, the man disappeared with him. The woman was greatly distressed and called the man's parents on a weekly basis, always asking if they knew anything about the whereabouts of their son and grandson. The man's parents knew quite well where their son and grandson were, and they often sent money to help support their son while he was on the run. However, they always insisted that they knew nothing about the child. Four years after the child was abducted, the police arrested the man and returned the child to his mother. If the woman files an action against the man's parents, alleging infliction of emotional distress, will she prevail?
1729	On November 1, Debbit, an accountant, and Barrister, a lawyer, contracted for the sale by Debbit to Barrister of the law books Debbit had inherited from his father. Barrister agreed to pay the purchase price of $10,000 when Debbit delivered the books on December 1. On November 10, Barrister received a signed letter from Debbit that stated: "I have decided to dispose of the book stacks containing the law books you have already purchased. If you want the stacks, I will deliver them to you along with the books on December 1 at no additional cost to you. Let me know before November 15 whether you want them. I will not sell them to anyone else before then." On November 14, Barrister faxed and Debbit received the following message: "I accept your offer of the stacks." Debbit was not a merchant with respect to either law books or book stacks. Debbit is contractually obligated to deliver the stacks because
1730	A grand jury returned an indictment charging Daniels with bank robbery, and when he could not make bond he was jailed pending trial. He had received Miranda warnings when arrested and had made no statement at that time. The prosecutor arranged to have Innis, an informant, placed as Daniels's cellmate and instructed Innis to find out about the bank robbery without asking any direct questions about it. Innis, once in the cell, constantly boasted about the crimes that he had committed. Not to be outdone, Daniels finally declared that he had committed the bank robbery with which he was charged. At Daniels's trial, his attorney moved to exclude any testimony from Innis concerning Daniels's boast. The motion should be
1731	A city adopted an ordinance providing that street demonstrations involving more than 15 persons may not be held in commercial areas during "rush" hours. "Exceptions" may be made to the prohibition "on 24-hour advance application to and approval by the police department." The ordinance also imposes sanctions on any person "who shall, without provocation, use to or about someone and in his presence, opprobrious words or abusive language tending to cause a breach of the peace." No court has as of yet interpreted the ordinance. Which of the following is the strongest argument that both parts of the ordinance are facially unconstitutional?
1732	The manager of a monthly antique market was looking to hire a professional appraiser who would tell patrons, for a fee of $10 per item, what their antique is worth. Because the manager had had problems at other antique markets he had run because appraisers built up a popular following and then abruptly quit for a better job, he emphasized during the hiring interview the importance of honoring the contract to its completion. When the manager offered the job to an experienced appraiser, and the appraiser accepted, the written contract signed by the appraiser contained, in addition to an agreed-to salary, a liquidated damages clause for early termination of the contract. It also contained another clause providing that the appraiser would receive 5% of all gate receipts to be paid as a bonus at the end of the contract, which ran for one year. Eight months into the contract, the manager's worst fears were realized when the appraiser got a more lucrative offer and abruptly quit, leaving the manager scrambling to find a replacement for him. In response to the manager's suit for breach of contract, the appraiser brings a countersuit to recover 5% of gate receipts for the antique markets at which he worked. Will the appraiser be successful in his countersuit?
1733	Vintner is the owner of a large vineyard and offers balloon rides to visitors who wish to tour the grounds from the air. During one of the rides, Vintner was forced to make a crash landing on his own property. Without Vintner's knowledge or consent, Trespasser had entered the vineyard to camp for a couple of days. Trespasser was injured when he was hit by the basket of the descending balloon. If Trespasser sues Vintner to recover damages for his injuries, will Trespasser prevail?
1734	A father executed a deed to his art gallery "to my daughter for her life, and on my daughter's death to her children; provided, however, that if my daughter stops painting, to my brother." The daughter has two children and is still painting. At the time of the grant, the interest of the daughter's two children is best described as:
1735	Defendant is charged with murder in connection with a carjacking incident during which Defendant allegedly shot Victim while attempting to steal Victim's car. The prosecutor calls Victim's four-year-old son, whose face was horribly disfigured by the same bullet, to testify that Defendant shot his father and him. The son's testimony should be
1736	An ordinance of the city of Green requires that its mayor must have been continuously a resident of the city for at least five years at the time he or she takes office. Candidate, who is thinking about running for mayor in an election that will take place next year, will have been a resident of Green for only four and one-half years at the time the mayor elected then takes office. Before he decides whether to run for the position of mayor, Candidate wants to know whether he could lawfully assume that position if he were elected. As a result, Candidate files suit in the local federal district court for a declaratory judgment that the Green five-year-residence requirement is unconstitutional and that he is entitled to a place on his political party's primary election ballot for mayor. He names the chairman of his political party as the sole defendant but does not join any election official. The chairman responds by joining Candidate in requesting the court to declare the Green residence requirement invalid. In this case, the court should
1737	An advertising agency specializing in aerial banners and skywriting signed a contract with a film production company that was premiering a new blockbuster film. The contract provided that the agency would advertise the film by flying over the city towing a giant streamer belonging to the film company heralding the film's catch phrase and title in large letters. This contract specified that the flight was to be conducted on the first Saturday in June at noon (when the film was showing locally) and the film company was to pay the advertising agency $500 for the flight. On the designated Saturday, the advertising agency was unable to fly because of a defective fuel pump. The defective condition was entirely unforeseeable and did not occur through any negligence or fault of the agency. The film company did not pay the agency, and each of the parties has sued the other for damages. Which of the following best states the rights and liabilities of the parties?
1738	A landlord leased an office building to a tenant for 10 years. The tenant, a secondyear law student, was familiar with the state's recording act, which provided: No conveyance is valid against any subsequent purchaser for value without notice unless the conveyance is recorded. No lease for three years or more is valid against a subsequent purchaser for value without notice unless the lease has been recorded. Believing it would be obvious to any prospective purchaser that the tenant was in possession of the property, she failed to record the lease. Shortly thereafter, the landlord entered into a contract to sell the leased property to a buyer. Before purchasing the property, the buyer merely drove by it, and thus did not notice the tenant's occupancy. The standard title search did not reveal the lease because it was unrecorded. The buyer tendered the purchase money to the landlord, and the landlord conveyed to the buyer the property by warranty deed. The buyer subsequently found the tenant in possession of the premises and ordered her to vacate. The tenant refused and asked the buyer where she should send the rent checks. In an action by the buyer to evict the tenant, the court should rule that:
1739	On January 1, a golf pro shop mailed an order for $1,000 worth of golf balls to a golf supply distributor, specifying that it would pay for the balls within 30 days of delivery. The golf balls were delivered on February 15. Two days later, the distributor learned that the pro shop had been insolvent for at least a month and immediately made a demand on the pro shop to reclaim the golf balls, despite the pro shop's assurances that it would still make the payment before March 15. May the distributor reclaim the golf balls?
1740	Innes worked as a secretary in an office in a building occupied partly by her employer and partly by Glass, a retail store. The two areas were separated by walls and were in no way connected, except that the air conditioning unit served both areas and there was a common return-air duct. Glass began remodeling, and its employees did the work, which included affixing a plastic surfacing material to counters. To fasten the plastic to the counters, the employees purchased glue, with the brand name Stick, that was manufactured by Steel, packaged in a sealed container by Steel, and retailed by Paint Company. In the course of the remodeling job, one of Glass's employees turned on the air conditioning and caused fumes from the glue to travel from Glass through the air conditioning unit and into Innes' office. The employees did not know that there was common ductwork for the air conditioners. Innes was permanently blinded by the fumes from the glue. The label on the container of glue read, "DANGER. Do not smoke near this product. Extremely flammable. Contains Butanone, Toluol and Hexane. Use with adequate ventilation. Keep out of the reach of children." The three chemicals listed on the label are very toxic and harmful to human eyes. Steel had received no reports of eye injuries during the ten years that the Product had been manufactured and sold. If Innes asserts a claim against Paint Company, the most likely result is that she will
1741	The plaintiff is suing the defendant to recover for damage to the plaintiff's garage, which burned down from a fire that started in the defendant's bakery. The plaintiff alleged that the fire was started by one of the bakery's employees, who was known to come into the bakery after an evening of drinking at a nearby bar to experiment with recipes. The defendant denied the allegation and claimed that the fire was the result of arson by a local gang member. At trial, the plaintiff called to the stand a court reporter, who will testify that he recorded the testimony of the now-deceased manager of the bakery at a preliminary hearing on a criminal charge of arson against the gang member, and the manager testified that the fire was the result of the employee's drunken experiments. The defendant objects to the court reporter's testimony. The court should rule that the testimony is:
1742	A manufacturer of electronic game cartridges for use with other manufacturers' electronic game systems received a letter from a buyer for a large toy store chain ordering two 100-unit lots of a particular game cartridge from the manufacturer's catalog. The buyer's letter stated that the cartridges must be compatible with two specified game systems. The manufacturer made no warranties of any type regarding the compatibility of the cartridges with any game systems, but both parties reasonably believed that the cartridges were compatible with both game systems. On receiving the shipment, the buyer discovered that the cartridges did not work with one of the game systems. Which of the following is the most appropriate remedy for the buyer?
1743	The plaintiff was injured when her car was hit head-on by a pickup truck belonging to a landscaping company. The plaintiff brought an action against the truck driver and the landscaping company, alleging negligence by the truck driver in driving too fast. Counsel for the plaintiff seeks to introduce the statement of a former employee of the landscaping company, who said to the truck driver just before the accident, "You had better slow down. You've been warned by the boss many times not to go this fast." The judge should rule the statement admissible only if:
1744	An electrician was employed by an electrical services company that had contracts with a number of large office and condominium buildings to provide emergency electrical services and repairs at any hour of the day or night. Hence, he was required to be "on call" 24 hours a day and to drive his company van, which had all of his tools, to his home each night. One afternoon, the electrician left the company's office at 4 p.m. as usual. However, when he left the main highway, he did not turn left toward his home but instead turned right toward the supermarket a few blocks away to pick up some items for dinner. While leaving the supermarket parking lot, the electrician drove negligently and struck a pedestrian. The pedestrian suffered serious injuries and required several operations and a lengthy hospital stay. The pedestrian filed suit against the company for $100,000. Is the pedestrian likely to recover from the company?
1745	In which of the following scenarios does a defendant have a constitutional right to be represented by counsel?
1746	While approaching an intersection with the red light against him, Motorist suffered a heart attack that rendered him unconscious. Motorist's car struck Child, who was crossing the street with the green light in her favor. Under the state motor vehicle code, it is an offense to drive through a red traffic light. Child sued Motorist to recover for her injuries. At trial it was stipulated that (1) immediately prior to suffering the heart attack, Motorist had been driving within the speed limit, had seen the red light, and had begun to slow his car; (2) Motorist had no history of heart disease and no warning of this attack; (3) while Motorist was unconscious, his car ran the red light. On cross motions for directed verdicts on the issue of liability at the conclusion of the proofs, the court should
1747	After being arrested on suspicion of murder, a suspect was taken to the police station and informed of his constitutional rights as required by the Miranda decision. He immediately requested that a lawyer be provided because he had no money to hire one. The arresting officer said that he would get the suspect's lawyer after he was booked, and the officer proceeded to book him. During the booking search, the suspect said to the arresting officer, "I only killed the bastard because he made a pass at me."9 If the suspect attempts to prevent introduction of the statement made by him to the officer during booking, he will most likely:
1748	A critically acclaimed movie that had received a number of awards opened in a small town. The film had portrayals of nudity and scenes involving sexuality, but its advertising was very tasteful and concentrated on its critical acclaim and its receipt of seven Academy Award nominations. Nevertheless, when the movie opened in the small town, there was a public outcry against it, including picketing. The town, which had been founded in the late nineteenth century by a fundamentalist religious group, remained very conservative and highly religious, and was the only community in the state where a consensus of the community would find the movie to be obscene. The town prosecutor went to the local court seeking an injunction to halt the showing of the movie. The theater owner refused to voluntarily stop showing the film and appeared in court to defend against the proposed injunction. What is the owner's best defense?
1749	On January 2, a retiree borrowed $1,000 from a friend, agreeing in writing to repay the loan within a year. In September, it became clear to the retiree that he would have difficulty meeting the deadline, and so he approached an acquaintance who owned a print shop with the following proposition: He would perform 200 hours of work for the print shop owner within six months at the special rate of $5 per hour, if the print shop owner would agree to pay $1,000 for the entire 200 hours to the retiree's friend on January 1. The print shop owner agreed. By January 1, the retiree had worked only five hours for the print shop owner, and the print shop owner refused to pay the retiree's friend because the retiree had not worked the agreed-upon number of hours. The retiree told the print shop owner that it was "no problem," and to just hold on to the money until he worked the full 200 hours, and then pay his friend. The print shop owner agreed. Subsequently, the retiree's friend learned of the arrangements between the retiree and the print shop owner and sued the print shop owner for $1,000. The probable result of this action will be:
1750	Fifteen years ago, a homeowner executed his will, devising his home "to my surviving widow for life, remainder to such of my children as shall live to attain the age of 30 years; but if any child dies under the age of 30 years survived by a child or children, such child or children shall take and receive the share which his, her, or their parent would have received had such parent lived to attain the age of 30 years." At the date of writing his will, the homeowner was married to an actress, and they had two adult daughters. The actress died 10 years ago, and the homeowner married a dancer two years later. At his death last year, the homeowner was survived by the dancer and three children, the two daughters from his marriage to the actress, and a son. The son, who is six years old, was the homeowner's child by the dancer. The jurisdiction recognizes the common law Rule Against Perpetuities unmodified by statute. The result of the application of the Rule is:
1751	Barnes was hired as an assistant professor of mathematics at Reardon State College and is now in his third consecutive one-year contract. Under state law he cannot acquire tenure until after five consecutive annual contracts. In his third year, Barnes was notified that he was not being re-hired for the following year. Applicable state law and college rules did not require either a statement of reasons or a hear ing, and in fact neither was offered to Barnes. Which of the following, if established, sets forth the strongest constitutional argument Barnes could make to compel the college to furnish him a statement of reasons for the failure to rehire him and an opportunity for a hearing?
1752	An owner conveyed his farm to his friend for life, then to a farmer and a rancher as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. One night, the friend, the farmer, and the rancher were riding together in an automobile when it was struck by a truck. They were rushed to the emergency room of a local hospital. While all three were alive when they arrived at the hospital, the hospital records establish that the rancher died at 10:28 p.m., the farmer died at 10:29 p.m., and the friend died at 10:30 p.m. that same night. The jurisdiction has not adopted the Uniform Simultaneous Death Act or any local modification of that Act. Who takes the farm?
1753	A seller owned two properties located in an arid region. A developer, prior to purchasing the southern parcel, hired a highly qualified engineer to conduct a survey of the property. After receiving the engineer's report that the underground aquifer was adequate to supply the developer's needs for his proposed home, the developer went ahead with his purchase of the property. However, he delayed building his planned home. The following year, a family purchased the northern parcel. They built a large house on the land, installed a swimming pool, and planted a large garden. The house, the pool, and the garden were all supplied with water from a well the family had drilled on the northern parcel. A few years later, the family built two small houses on the land and rented them out to tenants. The tenants' needs for water were supplied from the family's well. Five years later, the developer finally constructed his home and drilled a well on the southern parcel. He moved into the home during the winter and found the supply of water for his personal needs to be adequate. However, during the ensuing summer, when the neighboring family filled the pool and irrigated the garden, the pressure dropped in the developer's well, and many days only a trickle of water came out of his pipes. The jurisdiction applies the reasonable use doctrine in determining rights to underground water. If the developer brings suit against the family to determine his rights in the aquifer, he will likely:
1754	The legislature of a state passed a statute providing that "no newspaper in this state shall publish a political endorsement or an editorial favoring one political candidate or party over another on either the day of election or the day preceding the day of election." The stated purpose for the legislation was to prevent unfair attacks on candidates and to ensure that they would have time to respond to or rebut any published article prior to the election. A newspaper published in the state, which was distributed regionally and in states bordering the state, filed suit in federal court seeking to enjoin enforcement of the statute. The newspaper's best argument for the invalidity of the statute is which of the following?
1755	A police officer was given a tip about a blond male living in a nearby trailer park who was selling narcotics. The officer immediately drove to the trailer park and obtained from the manager the names of six blond males who had trailers or mobile homes in the trailer park. At the first lot, the officer knocked on the defendant's door, announced that he was a police officer, and asked to talk to the defendant. The defendant's girlfriend, who did not live there but had been visiting, told the officer that the defendant would not be back for some time. The officer, believing that the girlfriend lived there, told her that he suspected that the defendant was dealing drugs and asked her if he could look around a little. The girlfriend said, "Sure, why not?" and let the officer in. After seeing nothing in the main living area, he went into the small back bedroom and opened several small storage compartments. In the corner of one of the compartments, he found an opaque bag. On opening it, he observed that it contained what appeared to be marijuana and confiscated the bag. Shortly thereafter, the defendant was arrested and charged with possession of narcotics with intent to distribute, a felony. On a motion by the defendant's attorney to suppress the introduction of the marijuana into evidence, how is the court likely to rule?
1756	A consumer purchased a portable electronic device from a retailer. The device was in the manufacturer's original packaging when the consumer purchased it. Shortly thereafter, the consumer was using the device appropriately when it generated an electrical shock. The shock injured the consumer and caused the circuits of the device to overheat and melt, destroying the device. The consumer brought an action based on strict liability against the manufacturer of the device. At trial, the consumer established the above facts. The consumer's expert testified that the product was in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to users. However, because the device was destroyed, the expert could not determine whether the accident was caused by a design defect or a manufacturing defect. The manufacturer's expert testified that the device was not defective. If the manufacturer moves for a directed verdict at the close of the evidence, how should the court rule?
1757	A department store and its former manager were being sued for false imprisonment arising from the detention of the plaintiff by a security guard for suspected shoplifting. The plaintiff's attorney wishes to introduce a report from a police officer who was brought back to the store by the plaintiff after she was released. In the report, the manager states that he was not present when the plaintiff was stopped, but that the guard told him that the plaintiff was stopped because of her "shifty eyes," and that she would not have been stopped if she had not looked so suspicious. The attorney for the department store objects to the use of the manager's statement in the police report. The objection should be:
1758	Plummer, a well-known politician, was scheduled to address a large crowd at a political dinner. Just as he was about to sit down at the head table, Devon pushed Plummer's chair to one side. As a result, Plummer fell to the floor. Plummer was embarrassed at being made to look foolish before a large audience but suffered no physical harm. If Plummer asserts a claim against Devon for damages because of his embarrassment, will Plummer prevail?
1759	On May 1, a sales manager announced at a monthly sales meeting that he would give a $1,000 bonus to the salesperson with the highest sales at the end of the month. The sales manager's announcement would best be interpreted as:
1760	A motorist was driving to a luncheon in a car that he knew did not have operating headlights. On the way there he was rear-ended by another driver who had been driving 20 m.p.h. over the speed limit posted on that stretch of road. He suffered personal injuries and his car was extensively damaged. The jurisdiction makes it a misdemeanor to drive a vehicle that does not have operating headlights. If the motorist brings an action against the other driver and the above facts are established, will he prevail?
1761	To buy a house, an investor secured a $10,000 mortgage from a bank. The bank promptly and properly recorded its mortgage. Subsequently, the investor financed certain improvements to the house with a $2,000 mortgage on the land from a finance company. The finance company promptly and properly recorded its mortgage. Before the investor made a payment on either mortgage, the federal government announced that it would begin storing nuclear waste products in the area. The value of property, including the investor's house, plummeted. The investor did not pay either the bank or the finance company, and the bank brought a proper action to foreclose, notifying both the investor and the finance company. A buyer bought the house at the foreclosure sale for $6,000, which was its fair market value. There are no special statutes in the jurisdiction regarding deficiency judgments. The investor owes:
1762	A woman decided to have a nude painting done of herself. She contracted in writing with an artist, who agreed to paint the woman nude for $10,000. The fee was payable on completion of the painting, provided that the painting was to the woman's "complete and utter satisfaction." On the same afternoon that the artist entered into the contract with the woman, he assigned the contract to his cousin. The artist then painted the woman's picture. After the job was done, the woman told him, "That's a very good likeness of me, but it shows my defects, so I'm not satisfied." She refused to accept the painting or to pay the artist or his cousin. Can the cousin recover from the woman?
1763	A couple suspected of fraud spent many hours at a police station for the purposes of investigation. Having fallen asleep on her chair, the wife was awakened by a police officer, and, still groggy, she thought that she was being attacked, and she punched the police officer in the face before she realized the truth. Later, the husband was being interrogated. The interrogation officer accidentally touched a live electrical wire to the husband's armpit, which caused his arm to involuntarily twitch and strike the interrogator in her face. Which defendant(s) can be convicted of battery under these facts?
1764	On February 10, an owner took out a $10,000 mortgage on her land with a bank. On February 15, the owner conveyed the land for $50,000 to a buyer who was not aware of the mortgage. On February 17, the bank recorded its mortgage interest in the land. On February 21, the buyer recorded his deed to the land. Does the buyer hold the land subject to the bank's mortgage?
1765	A decedent died without having executed a will, leaving a substantial estate to be distributed by the probate court. The jurisdiction's applicable statute provides that where a decedent leaves neither issue nor spouse, nor parents, his estate goes to his brothers and sisters and their descendants. The decedent was never married, had no children, and both of his parents are dead. A woman whose birth certificate was destroyed by fire seeks to establish that she is the daughter of the decedent's only sibling, who is now also deceased. The woman offers into evidence a statement in a properly recorded trust instrument. The instrument was executed by the decedent's father and recited that certain specified real property conveyed by the decedent's father into the trust should be held for her benefit, as "my loving granddaughter." The document actually offered is an enlarged print photocopy of microfilm records, authenticated by an employee of the county. The trial court should:
1766	When a man purchased his new home, he kept his old residence because he had not yet received any acceptable purchase offers. He agreed to rent it to a woman but told her that he was intending to sell the house in a few months and that she would have to move if the new owners so desired. The woman agreed and moved in, paying the man the agreed rent of $100 per week by dropping off cash at the man's new house every Friday. After serious business losses, the man had to sell his new home for the amount mortgaged and informed the woman that she would have to vacate the old home. The woman refused and the next Friday brought over the $100 rental payment, but the man refused to accept it. The following Monday, the man's lawyer commenced an action to evict the woman from the man's old home. The jurisdiction requires that a statutory written notice be served on any tenant whose term is for less than month-tomonth, or is not for a fixed term, at least three days before commencement of eviction proceedings. No written notice of any kind was given to the woman. The man is most likely to gain immediate possession of his home by arguing that the woman is:
1767	In a writing signed by both parties on December 1, Kranc agreed to buy from Schaff a gasoline engine for $1,000, delivery to be made on the following February 1. Through a secretarial error, the writing called for delivery on March 1, but neither party noticed the error until February 1. Before signing the agreement, Kranc and Schaff orally agreed that the contract of sale would be effective only if Kranc should notify Schaff in writing not later than January 2 that Kranc had arranged to resell the engine to a third person. Otherwise, they agreed orally, "There is no deal." On December 15, Kranc entered into a contract with Trimota to resell the engine to Trimota at a profit. For this question only, assume the following facts. On December 16, Kranc notified Schaff by telephone of Kranc's resale agreement with Trimota, and explained that a written notice was unfeasible because Kranc's secretary was ill. Schaff replied, "That's okay. I'll get the engine to you on February 1, as we agreed." Having learned, however, that the engine had increased in value about 75% since December 1, Schaff renounced the agreement on February 1. If Kranc sues Schaff on February 2 for breach of contract, which of the following concepts best supports Kranc's claim?
1768	In a contract suit by Perez against Drake, each of the following is an accepted method of authenticating Drake's signature on a document offered by Perez EXCEPT:
1769	The Pinners, a retired couple, had lived in their home in a residential neighborhood for 20 years when the Darleys moved into the house next door and built a swimming pool in the back yard. The four young Darley children frequently played in the pool after school. They often were joined by other neighborhood children. The Pinners were in the habit of reading and listening to classical music in the afternoons. Sometimes they took naps. The boisterous sounds of the children playing in the pool disturbed the Pinners' customary enjoyment of quiet afternoons. In the Pinners' nuisance action for damages against the Darleys, the Pinners should
1770	As a result of an accident at the NPP nuclear power plant, a quantity of radioactive vapor escaped from the facility and two members of the public were exposed to excessive doses of radiation. According to qualified medical opinion, that exposure will double the chance that these two persons will ultimately develop cancer. However, any cancer that might be caused by this exposure will not be detectable for at least ten years. If the two exposed persons do develop cancer, it will not be possible to determine whether it was caused by this exposure or would have developed in any event. If the exposed persons assert a claim for damages against NPP shortly after the escape of the radiation, which of the following questions will NOT present a substantial issue?
1771	A teenager stole a car from the homeowner's driveway after she had left the keys in the car overnight. He was stopped for speeding and a license plate check indicated that the car had been reported stolen. The teenager was charged with common law larceny. At trial, his defense was that he intended to return the car to the owner's home the following morning before anyone realized it had been taken. The trial judge instructed the jury that while the state must prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt, the defendant has the responsibility to prove his defense by a preponderance of the evidence. The court further instructed the jury that if it found by a preponderance of the evidence that the teenager intended to return the car, it should find him not guilty. The teenager was convicted; he appealed on the ground that the jury instructions were erroneous. The teenager's conviction should be:
1772	The plaintiff sued the defendant for battery. The defendant claimed that he was attacked for no reason by the plaintiff and that he hit the plaintiff with a pipe in self-defense. A witness was called to testify that on the day in question she heard the defendant and his roommate talking outside their apartment. The witness testified that the roommate told the defendant that the plaintiff had been flirting with the defendant's girlfriend, and that the defendant seemed very angry. The defendant's attorney objected to this testimony. The court should find the evidence:
1773	A landowner embarked on an expedition into a remote jungle, leaving no means to communicate with him. Because property values suddenly began plummeting in the landowner's neighborhood, his son believed that it was imperative to sell his father's property before it became worthless. Having no way to speak to his father ahead of time, the son prepared a deed conveying the property to a buyer, but left the line for the buyer's name blank. He then signed his father's name on it as the grantor, and handed the deed to the buyer. The deed, however, did not include any language regarding the amount the father was to receive in exchange for the property. The buyer believed that the son was the owner of the property. When the father returned, he was happy that the property had been sold. If the buyer changed his mind and now wishes to have the conveyance set aside, which of the following would be his best argument?
1774	In a criminal trial, the prosecution called an expert witness to the stand. The prosecutor conducted a direct examination of the witness that lasted one-half hour. The defense attorney cross-examined the witness for three days and told the court that he planned to spend at least another day in cross-examination to develop testimony brought up on direct examination. The prosecutor moved that the cross-examination be terminated by the court. May the court approve the prosecutor's motion?
1775	Read the summaries of the decisions in the four cases (A- D) below. Then decide which is most applicable as a precedent to each of the cases in the questions that follow, and indicate each choice by marking the corresponding space on the answer sheet. Policeman undertook to arrest Fan for throwing a pop bottle, and hitting a baseball umpire. Fan was innocent and indignantly objected to being arrested. Since Policeman had no warrant, the arrest was illegal. Fan, forcibly resisting Policeman, finally succeeded in seizing Policeman's revolver and shot him dead.
1776	During the course of his trial for assault, the defendant placed a professional sociologist on the stand. The sociologist testified that she had scientifically polled the community in which the defendant lived and that the defendant had a high reputation for being a peaceable man in a rather rough community. On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked the sociologist if she filed a false income tax return last year. The sociologist has in fact been convicted of filing a false tax return; however, the defense immediately objected. Should the court require the sociologist to answer the question posed to her?
1777	In separate lawsuits, the driver of a car and the passenger both sued the defendant for injuries sustained when the defendant's car struck the driver's car. In the passenger's lawsuit, he testified that he was not paying attention to the other cars on the road at the time of the accident, but offers into evidence the prior deposition testimony of the driver. At that deposition, the driver had testified that she noticed the defendant's car swerving in the lane next to her and suddenly crossing into her lane and colliding with her car. The driver had moved out of state shortly after her lawsuit concluded. No attempt was made to locate the driver or procure her attendance. Should the court admit the deposition testimony over the defendant's objection?
1778	A homeowner was postponing shoveling the snow off her driveway one Saturday morning because it was so cold outside. When she heard a scream and ran outside, she found the neighborhood newspaper delivery boy injured, lying by his bicycle in her driveway. Feeling terribly guilty, she took the boy to a local doctor and wrote a note to the doctor that she would cover all the subsequent costs. The boy later admitted that he was attempting to ride the bicycle with his eyes closed, and that his fall had nothing to do with the snow in the homeowner's driveway. After treating the boy for his injuries until he recovered, the doctor sent the homeowner a bill for his services. When the homeowner refused to pay, the doctor brought an action to recover the amount of his bill. Who will prevail?
1779	A plaintiff sued a defendant for personal injuries, claiming that while the plaintiff was driving through an intersection at the posted speed limit, the defendant failed to stop at a stop sign and struck her car. At trial, the plaintiff calls the defendant's friend to testify to the fact that the defendant never stops at the stop sign at the accident intersection and invariably "runs" every stop sign. The defendant's objection to the testimony should be:
1780	A developer owned a large tract of land that she had surveyed by a licensed surveyor and then subdivided into numerous lots. At the time of the survey, the surveyor drove wooden stakes into the ground to mark the boundaries. The surveyor then made a plat of the survey and recorded the plat in the county recorder of deeds office. Shortly thereafter, a buyer purchased one of the lots from the developer. Prior to the purchase, the developer had shown the buyer the wooden stakes, and the buyer accepted such stakes as marking the boundaries of the lot. After taking possession of the lot, the buyer built a house thereon and enclosed it with a fence. A few months later, an investor purchased the adjacent lot from the developer. After taking possession of her lot, the investor hired a licensed surveyor to survey it. This surveyor discovered that, according to the recorded plat, the buyer's fence extended two feet onto the adjacent lot. On learning this, the investor demanded that the buyer remove his fence. The buyer refused. If the investor sues the buyer, who will prevail?
1781	Defendant visited a fellow college student, James, in James's dormitory room. They drank some beer. James produced a box containing marijuana cigarettes and asked if Defendant wanted one. Defendant, afraid of being caught, declined and urged James to get rid of the marijuana. James refused. Shortly thereafter, both went out to get more beer, leaving the door to James's room standing open. Making an excuse about having dropped his pen, Defendant went back into James's room. Still apprehensive about their being caught with the marijuana cigarettes, he took the cigarettes and flushed them down the toilet. He was sure James was too drunk to notice that the cigarettes were missing. Defendant is charged with larceny and burglary (defined in the jurisdiction as breaking and entering the dwelling of another with intent to commit any felony or theft). He should be found guilty of
1782	A consumer purchased a grass trimmer from a hardware store. He took it out of the box and assembled it according to the instructions. He noticed that there were bolts and screws left over and some joints that could have accepted additional fasteners, but he just discarded the extra hardware. As he was using the trimmer, the housing came apart and a hard piece of plastic flew off. His neighbor, who was standing nearby, was struck in the eye by the piece of plastic and suffered permanent injuries. The neighbor sued the hardware store and the manufacturer of the trimmer in a strict liability action. Through discovery, it was determined that the instructions omitted a critical step in the assembly process that would have used the extra hardware, which is why the housing came apart, and that the manufacturer had received some complaints about the instructions previously. The hardware store had no knowledge of any complaints regarding any of the manufacturer's products. As to the hardware store, the neighbor will:
1783	The defendant, charged with murder, was present with her attorney at a preliminary examination when a witness, who was the defendant in a separate prosecution for concealing the body of the murder victim, testified for the prosecution against the defendant. When called to testify at the defendant's trial, the witness refused to testify, although ordered to do so. If the prosecution offers evidence of the witness's testimony at the preliminary examination, the evidence is:
1784	In 1940, Cattle Company paid $30,000 for a 150-acre tract of agricultural land well suited for a cattle feed lot. The tract was ten miles from the city of Metropolis, then a community of 50,000 people, and five miles from the nearest home. By 1976, the city limits extended to Cattle Company's feed lot, and the city had a population of 350,000. About 10,000 people lived within three miles of the cattle feeding operation. The Cattle Company land is outside the city limits and no zoning ordinance applies. The Cattle Company land is now worth $300,000, and $25,000 has been invested in buildings and pens. Cattle Company, conscious of its obligations to its neighbors, uses the best and most sanitary feed lot procedures, including chemical sprays, to keep down flies and odors and frequently removes manure. Despite these measures, residents of Metropolis complain of flies and odors. An action has been filed by five individual homeowners who live within half a mile of the Cattle Company feed lot. The plaintiffs' homes are valued currently at $25,000 to $40,000 each. Flies in the area are five to ten times more numerous than in other parts of Metropolis, and extremely obnoxious odors are frequently carried by the wind to the plaintiffs' homes. The flies and odors are a substantial health hazard. If plaintiffs assert a claim based on private nuisance, plaintiffs will
1785	Penn sues Duke's Bar for injuries suffered in an automobile accident caused by Chase, who had been a patron of Duke's Bar. Penn claims that Chase was permitted to drink too much liquor at Duke's Bar before the accident. Penn offers evidence that, after the accident, the owner of Duke's Bar visited him at the hospital and, offering to pay all of Penn's medical expenses, said, "That's the least I can do after letting Chase leave the bar so drunk last night." The statement that Chase was drunk when he left the bar on the night of the accident is
1786	Breeder bought a two-month-old registered boar at auction from Pigstyle for $800. No express warranty was made. Fifteen months later, tests by experts proved conclusively that the boar had been born incurably sterile. If this had been known at the time of the sale, the boar would have been worth no more than $100. In an action by Breeder against Pigstyle to avoid the contract and recover the price paid, the parties stipulate that, as both were and had been aware, the minimum age at which the fertility of a boar can be determined is about 12 months. Which of the following will the court probably decide?
1787	A statute of the state of Tuscarora made it a misdemeanor to construct any building of more than five stories without an automatic fire sprinkler system. A local construction company built in Tuscarora a ten-story federal office building. It constructed the building according to the precise specifications of a federal contract authorized by federal statutes. Because the building was built without the automatic fire sprinkler system required by state law, Tuscarora prosecutes the private contractor. Which of the following is the company's strongest defense to that prosecution?
1788	Daniel is on trial for evading $100,000 in taxes. The prosecution offers in evidence an anonymous letter to the IRS, identified as being in Daniel's handwriting, saying, "I promised my mother on her deathbed I would try to pay my back taxes. Here is $10,000. I'll make other payments if you promise not to prosecute. Answer yes by personal ad saying, 'OK on tax deal.'" The letter is
1789	In certain parts of a state, single-family residences had become so expensive that the vast majority of families could no longer afford to buy a home. To alleviate this problem, the legislature enacted statutes creating a housing agency. The agency, organized along the lines of a private corporation, was authorized to act as general contractor and build homes in counties where the average cost of a new home exceeded by 50% the national average cost of a new home, then to sell the homes at the cost of materials and labor to first-time homebuyers. In one medium-sized city in the state, the average cost of a new home exceeded the national average by 15%, while in a nearby large city, the average cost of a new home exceeded the average by 50%. The agency began building and selling homes in the large city, but did not operate in the medium city. About 35% of the population of the medium city is of Armenian ethnicity. A citizen of Armenian heritage brings a class action against the state, seeking to have the agency's failure to operate in the medium city declared a violation of the right to equal protection of the Armenian citizens of that city. What fact would be most helpful for the citizen in challenging the statute?
1790	Congress enacted a statute providing that persons may challenge a state energy law on the ground that it is in conflict with the federal Constitution in either federal or state court. According to this federal statute, any decision by a lower state court upholding a state energy law against a challenge based on the federal Constitution may be appealed directly to the United States Supreme Court. The provisions of this statute that authorize direct United States Supreme Court review of specified decisions rendered by lower state courts are
1791	Sixty years ago by a properly executed and recorded deed, Albert conveyed Greenacre, a tract of land: "To Louis for life, then to Louis's widow for her life, then to Louis's child or children in equal shares." At that time, Louis, who was Albert's grandson, was six years old. Shortly thereafter, Albert died testate. Louis was his only heir at law. Albert's will left his entire estate to First Church. Twenty-five years ago, when he was 41, Louis married Maria who was then 20 years old; they had one child, Norman. Maria and Norman were killed in an automobile accident three years ago when Norman was 21. Norman died testate, leaving his entire estate to the American Red Cross. His father, Louis, was Norman's sole heir at law. Two years ago, Louis married Zelda. They had no children. This year, Louis died testate, survived by his widow, Zelda, to whom he left his entire estate. The common-law Rule Against Perpetuities is unchanged by statute in the jurisdiction. In an appropriate action to determine the ownership of Greenacre, the court should find that title is vested in
1792	Two robbers planned to commit armed robberies targeting older victims. However, when the time came to actually commit the robbery, one of the robbers, thinking that the potential victim looked too much like his grandmother, backed out and told his cohort that he was going home. The second robber went ahead with the plan and robbed the elderly victim, who died of a heart attack due to the stress of the robbery. The second robber was arrested and implicated the first robber. The first robber is guilty of:
1793	Which of the following statements most accurately states the prevailing view as to the burden of proving consent or lack thereof in a misdemeanor false imprisonment case?
1794	A mother properly executed a deed, purporting to convey a parcel of land to her son. The mother gave the deed to her son for his birthday. A week later, the son decided that he should not have accepted such an expensive gift and told his mother so, suggesting that she devise the land to him by will rather than by deed. Instead, the mother executed a will, devising the land to "my son and daughter, share and share alike." Two years later, the mother died. The next day, the son found the deed in his desk drawer and recorded it. Who has title to the land?
1795	Doe, the governor of State, signed a death warrant for Rend, a convicted murderer. Able and Baker are active opponents of the death penalty. At a demonstration protesting the execution of Rend, Able and Baker carried large signs that stated, "Governor Doe - Murderer." Television station XYZ broadcast news coverage of the demonstration, including pictures of the signs carried by Able and Baker. If Doe asserts against XYZ a claim for damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress, will Doe prevail?
1796	Otis owned in fee simple Lots 1 and 2 in an urban subdivision. The lots were vacant and unproductive. They were held as a speculation that their value would increase. Otis died and, by his duly probated will, devised the residue of his estate (of which Lots 1 and 2 were part) to Lena for life with remainder in fee simple to Rose. Otis's executor distributed the estate under appropriate court order, and notified Lena that future real estate taxes on Lots 1 and 2 were Lena's responsibility to pay. Except for the statutes relating to probate and those relating to real estate taxes, there is no applicable statute. Lena failed to pay the real estate taxes due for Lots 1 and 2. To prevent a tax sale of the fee simple, Rose paid the taxes and demanded that Lena reimburse her for same. When Lena refused, Rose brought an appropriate action against Lena to recover the amount paid. In such action, Rose should recover
1797	While crossing Spruce Street, Pesko was hit by a car that she did not see. Pesko sued Dorry for her injuries. At trial, Pesko calls Williams, a police officer, to testify that, ten minutes after the accident, a driver stopped him and said, "Officer, a few minutes ago I saw a hit-and-run accident on Spruce Street involving a blue convertible, which I followed to the drive-in restaurant at Oak and Third," and that a few seconds later Williams saw Dorry sitting alone in a blue convertible in the drive-in restaurant's parking lot. Williams' testimony about the driver's statement should be
1798	Householder resented the fact that joggers and walkers would sometimes come onto his property just beside the sidewalk in order to enjoy the feel of walking or running on grass. He put up a sign, "No Trespassing," but it did not stop the practice. He then put up a sign, "Beware of Skunk," and bought a young skunk. He took the skunk to Dr. Vet to have its scent gland removed. Unfortunately, Dr. Vet did not perform the operation properly, and the scent gland was not removed. Householder was unaware that it had not been removed, One day Walker was out for a stroll. When she came to Householder's property, she walked on the grass alongside the sidewalk on Householder's property. The skunk came up behind Walker and sprayed her with its scent. The smell was overpowering, and she fainted. She struck her head on the sidewalk and suffered serious injuries. The probable result of Walker's claim against Householder is that she will
1799	A retail seller of lawn and garden equipment entered into a written contract with a manufacturer of wheelbarrows. The terms of the contract called for the seller to deliver 100 fifteen-poundcapacity wheelbarrows to the buyer by March 1. On February 28, the buyer received from the seller 90 fifteen-pound-capacity wheelbarrows and 10 twenty-pound-capacity wheelbarrows. A letter accompanying the shipment stated, "We no longer make fifteen-pound-capacity wheelbarrows. We are sending the last 90 we have in stock along with 10 twenty-pound-capacity wheelbarrows. The twenty-pound-capacity were sent as an accommodation to you." Which of the following is not a correct statement?
1800	Downs was indicted in state court for bribing a public official. During the course of the investigation, police had demanded and received from Downs's bank the records of Downs's checking account for the preceding two years. The records contained incriminating evidence. On the basis of a claim of violation of his constitutional rights, Downs moves to prevent the introduction of the records in evidence. His motion should be
1801	A defendant was arrested for murder and given Miranda warnings. After seeming to struggle with his decision, the defendant stated that he did not want to say anything. The arresting officer then gave him her card, telling him that if he ever changes his mind and needs to get anything off his chest about the crime, to call her at any time. After the defendant was put into a jail cell, he asked a guard to call the police officer because he wanted to talk. The officer met with the defendant and again gave him Miranda warnings. The defendant indicated that he was waiving his rights and provided details about the murder that had not been made public. If the defendant's counsel brings a pretrial motion to suppress those statements, the court should:
1802	A defendant was owed $500 by his bookie. The defendant went to the bookie's house one night to get his money, but the bookie was not at home. So, the defendant opened an unlocked window and entered the house to see if he could find the $500 due him. He could not find the cash, so he decided to take a painting that he knew was worth substantially more than $500. He later sold it for $1,000 and kept the proceeds. The defendant is charged with burglary. The jurisdiction in which the bookie's house is located retains the common law requirements for burglary. The defendant should be found:
1803	Acting on information from reliable informants that drugs were being sold by residents at a certain fraternity house, the police obtained a search warrant that entitled them to search the entire premises for illegal narcotics. The police arrived at the house when a party was in progress and were admitted to the house by the fraternity president after showing the warrant. Officers proceeded to search the house. In an upstairs bedroom, they found a young woman who was a guest of a fraternity member sleeping on the bed. No one else was in the room. The police found a footlocker under the bed and opened it, finding a variety of illegal drugs. The police then awakened the woman and seized her purse from her. They found a small quantity of marijuana in the purse. The woman was charged with a drug possession offense. At her trial, the prosecution seeks to admit the marijuana seized from her purse over the objection of her attorney. Should the court admit the marijuana?
1804	FBI agents, without a warrant and without permission of Mexican law enforcement or judicial officers, entered Mexico, kidnapped Steven, an American citizen wanted in the United States for drug smuggling violations, and forcibly drove him back to Texas. Thereafter, the agents, again without a warrant, broke into the Texas home of Joan, wanted as a confederate of Steven, and arrested her. Steven and Joan were both indicted for narcotics violations. Both moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that their arrests violated the Fourth Amendment. The court should
1805	Defendant was upset because he was going to have to close his liquor store due to competition from a discount store in a new shopping mall nearby. In desperation, he decided to set fire to his store to collect the insurance. While looking through the basement for flammable material, he lit a match to read the label on a can. The match burned his finger and, in a reflex action, he dropped the match. It fell into a barrel and ignited some paper. Defendant made no effort to put out the fire but instead left the building. The fire spread and the store was destroyed by fire. Defendant was eventually arrested and indicted for arson. Defendant is
1806	In order to track down "fences" and other distributors of stolen goods, police officers, with permission of the owners and insurers, forwarded stolen jewelry they have intercepted on the way to the defendant, a reputed fence. The defendant took the jewelry, which he believed to be stolen. The defendant is guilty of:
1807	Penn sues Duke's Bar for injuries suffered in an automobile accident caused by Chase, who had been a patron of Duke's Bar. Penn claims that Chase was permitted to drink too much liquor at Duke's Bar before the accident. Duke's Bar called Chase to testify and expected him to say that he was sober when he left Duke's Barhowever, on direct examination Chase testified that he may have had a little too much to drink at Duke's Bar. Duke's Bar now seeks to confront Chase with his statement made on deposition that he was sober when he left Duke's Bar. Which of the following is true concerning this statement?
1808	A plaintiff's friend told her that she could use his lakeside cabin for the weekend. Her friend gave the plaintiff instructions on how to find his cabin, but once the plaintiff arrived at the lake, she found that all the cabins looked very similar. The plaintiff rechecked her friend's instructions and then entered the cabin that she thought belonged to her friend. In fact, the cabin belonged to a different cabin owner. After the plaintiff unpacked her luggage, she realized that the cabin was quite cold. Thus, she gathered some wood from the woodpile and started a fire in the fireplace. Unbeknownst to the plaintiff, the fireplace flue was blocked and so an explosion ensued, and the plaintiff was injured by the explosion. The cabin owner had known that the flue was blocked, but he had not gotten around to having the problem fixed because he was not going to be at the cabin for several weeks. If the plaintiff sues the cabin owner for her injuries, who will prevail?
1809	As a motorist was driving on a road, a driver on an intersecting road failed to see a stop sign at the intersection and crossed into the motorist's path. The motorist would have had time to avoid the driver's vehicle except that he was making a call on his cell phone. He slammed on the brakes as soon as he saw the driver, so the impact occurred at a low speed. The driver's car sustained only minor damage, but the motorist's car sustained such heavy damage that it was a total loss. If the motorist sues the driver in a jurisdiction following traditional contributory negligence and assumption of the risk rules, what is the driver's best defense?
1810	Post sued Dean for personal injury alleged to have been caused by Dean's negligence. A major issue at trial was whether Post's disability was caused solely by trauma or by a preexisting condition of osteoarthritis. Post called Dr. Cox, who testified that the disability was caused by trauma. On cross-examination, Dr. Cox testified that a medical textbook entitled Diseases of the Joints was authoritative and that she agreed with the substance of passages from the textbook that she was directed to look at, but that the passages were inapplicable to Post's condition because they dealt with rheumatoid arthritis rather than with the Osteoarthritis that Post was alleged to have. Dean then called his expert, Dr. Freed, who testified that, with reference to the issue being litigated, there is no difference between the two kinds of arthritis. Dean's counsel than asks permission to read to the jury the textbook passages earlier shown to Dr. Cox. The judge should rule the textbook passages
1811	The police suspected that a man was dealing in illegal drugs. They gathered a sufficient amount of evidence and obtained a search warrant. They went to the man's home, arrested him, and conducted a thorough search. They found and confiscated large amounts of cocaine. At a suppression hearing, the man sought to suppress the evidence against him. The prosecution informed the court that the warrant had been issued on the basis of information provided by an informant. The man's attorney requested the prosecution to produce the informant for questioning. When the prosecution refused to do so, the attorney made a further motion to suppress all of the evidence against his client obtained from the search on the basis that his client was denied the right of confrontation by the prosecution's refusal to produce the informant. The attorney's motion to suppress should be:
1812	The defendant entered a bank, planning to rob it. An alert bank employee saw the defendant brandishing her gun and pushed the silent alarm button to summon the police, and most of the employees and customers were successful in fleeing the bank. However, when the police surrounded the bank, the defendant was still inside with a hostage, one of the bank's tellers, whom the defendant had forced to turn over all the money in her drawer. The police obtained only a vague description of the defendant from the fleeing employees and customers as being a white female of average height, but all agreed that she was wearing a bright yellow scarf around her neck. The defendant, hoping to distract the police and escape out a back door, forced the teller to put on the bright yellow scarf and walk in front of a window. A rookie police officer, on seeing the yellow scarf, opened fire, killing the bank teller immediately. The defendant was apprehended shortly thereafter trying to escape out the back door. If the defendant is prosecuted and found guilty of the teller's murder, it will be because:
1813	Police received an anonymous tip that Tusitala was growing marijuana in her backyard, which was surrounded by a 15-foot high, solid wooden fence. Officer Boa was unable to view the yard from the street, so he used a police helicopter to fly over Tusitala's house. Boa identified a large patch of marijuana plants growing right next to the house and used this observation to obtain a search warrant. Tusitala is prosecuted for possession of marijuana and moves to suppress use of the marijuana in evidence. The court should
1814	Plaintiff sued Defendant for personal injuries suffered in a train-automobile collision. Plaintiff called an eyewitness, who testified that the train was going 20 miles per hour. Defendant then offers the testimony of an experienced police accident investigator that, based on his training and experience and on his examination of the physical evidence, it is his opinion that the train was going between 5 and 10 miles per hour. Testimony by the investigator is
1815	Until 1954, the state of New Atlantic required segregation in all public and private schools, but all public schools are now desegregated. Other state laws, enacted before 1954 and continuing to the present, provide for free distribution of the same textbooks on secular subjects to students in all public and private schools. In addition, the state accredits schools and certifies teachers. Little White School House, a private school that offers elementary and secondary education in the state, denies admission to all non-Caucasians. Stone School is a private school that offers religious instruction. Which of the following is the strongest argument in favor of the constitutionality of free distribution of textbooks to the students at Stone School?
1816	Defendant was charged with attempted murder of Victor in a sniping incident in which Defendant allegedly shot at Victor from ambush as Victor drove his car along an expressway. The prosecutor offers evidence that seven years earlier Defendant had fired a shotgun into a woman's home and that Defendant had once pointed a handgun at another driver while driving on the street. This evidence should be
1817	Motorist arranged to borrow his friend Owner's car to drive for one day while Motorist's car was being repaired. Owner knew that the brakes on his car were faulty and might fail in an emergency. Owner forgot to tell Motorist about the brakes when Motorist picked up the car, but Owner did telephone Spouse, Motorist's wife, and told her about them. Spouse, however, forgot to tell Motorist. Motorist was driving Owner's car at a reasonable rate of speed and within the posted speed limit, with Spouse as passenger. Another car, driven by Cross, crossed in front of Motorist at an intersection and in violation of the traffic signal. Motorist tried to stop, but the brakes failed, and the two cars collided. If the brakes had been in proper working order, Motorist could have stopped in time to avoid the collision. Motorist and Spouse were injured. If Motorist asserts a claim against Owner, will Motorist prevail?
1818	A zoologist decided to install an artificial koi pond in his backyard. He asked his neighbor, a landscaper, for advice on doing the installation himself. After the zoologist dug a trench for the drainpipe, the neighbor complained that her garage, located only 20 feet from the trench, had developed numerous cracks in the foundation and walls. What is the zoologist's best defense to an action by the neighbor for the damage to her garage?
1819	A lawyer rented an office building for his law practice and subleased most of the building to three other tenants. The lawyer paid $2,000 per month to the owner and charged his subtenants $600 per month each. After having been in the building for three years, the lawyer and the owner orally agreed that the lawyer would purchase it for a price of $120,000, to be paid in monthly installments of $2,000 over a five-year period. It was further agreed that title would remain in the owner's name until $48,000 had been paid on the total price, whereupon the owner would deliver a deed to the lawyer. Shortly thereafter, the lawyer spent $4,000 redecorating his suite. During the course of the next two years, the lawyer hired an associate and placed her in one of the offices formerly occupied by one of the subtenants, and raised the monthly rental he charged the other two subtenants to $700. Two years after the agreement with the owner, the lawyer demanded that the owner convey the building by delivery of a deed. The owner refused, denying that any oral agreement for sale had ever existed. The lawyer brings an action for specific performance against the owner, who pleads the Statute of Frauds as a defense. If the owner wins, it will be because:
1820	Barnes was hired as an assistant professor of mathematics at Reardon State College and is now in his third consecutive one-year contract. Under state law he cannot acquire tenure until after five consecutive annual contracts. In his third year, Barnes was notified that he was not being re-hired for the following year. Applicable state law and college rules did not require either a statement of reasons or a hear ing, and in fact neither was offered to Barnes. Which of the following, if established, most strongly supports the college in refusing to give Barnes a statement of reasons or an opportunity for a hearing?
1821	Two companies manufacture pesticide and have plants located along the same river. During a specific 24-hour period, each plant discharged pesticide into the river because of negligence in their operations. A rancher operated a cattle ranch downstream from the plants. The rancher's cattle drank from the river and were poisoned by the pesticide. The amount of the discharge from either plant alone would not have been sufficient to cause any harm to the rancher's cattle. If the rancher asserts a claim against the two companies, what, if anything, will the rancher recover?
1822	An appropriations act passed by Congress over the President's veto directs that $1 billion "shall be spent" by the federal government for the development of a new military weapons system, which is available only from one company. On the order of the President, the Secretary of Defense refuses to authorize a contract for purchase of the weapons system. The company sues the Secretary of Defense, alleging an unlawful withholding of these federal funds. The strongest constitutional argument for the company is that:
1823	Police went to a warehouse in response to a report of a gunshot. There they found the defendant standing over the victim's body. They immediately arrested the defendant and gave him Miranda warnings. The defendant said nothing other than that he wanted an attorney. The defendant eventually was charged with murder and brought to trial. At trial, the defendant testified in his own defense. He claimed that he was in the warehouse alone when he was attacked by the victim, and that he shot the victim in self-defense. The prosecution, on cross-examination, asked the defendant why he did not tell the police when they arrived there that he had shot the victim in self-defense. The defendant's attorney objected to this question, but he was overruled. The defendant was unable to give a satisfactory answer, and the prosecution suggested that he was lying. The defendant was convicted. Does the defendant have grounds to appeal his conviction on the basis of the prosecutor's crossexamination?
1824	The federal accounting office issued a call for competitive bids for a contract to supply 3,000 four-wheel drive utility vehicles without antipollution devices and with engines with a displacement of 4,000 cubic centimeters. A supplier in a state won the contract as low bidder and began manufacture of the vehicles. However, the state's statutes require that automobiles manufactured in that state be equipped with antipollution devices and have a maximum displacement of 2,500 cubic centimeters. The supplier files suit in state court, seeking a judicial declaration that the state statute may not be enforced as to it. The court should rule:
1825	A mother received a telephone call asking her to meet with the vice principal of her son's school because he was caught cheating. As she was waiting in the hallway to meet with the vice principal, the school's janitor, a big man who was an amateur body builder, introduced himself as the vice principal and asked the mother to step into his office, closing the door behind him. For several minutes, the janitor asked the mother a series of flirtatious personal questions, causing the mother to grow very uncomfortable. However, she did not leave the office out of concern for her son's academic standing. The actual vice principal eventually returned to his office and ended the questioning. If the mother sues the janitor for false imprisonment, she is most likely to:
1826	An ordinance of Central City requires every operator of a taxicab in the city to have a license and permits revocation of that license only for "good cause." The Central City taxicab operator's licensing ordinance conditions the issuance of such a license on an agreement by the licensee that the licensee "not display in or on his or her vehicle any bumper sticker or other placard or sign favoring a particular candidate for any elected municipal office." The ordinance also states that it imposes this condition in order to prevent the possible imputation to the city council of the views of its taxicab licensees and that any licensee who violates this condition shall have his or her license revoked. Driver, the holder of a Central City taxicab operator's license, decorates his cab with bumper stickers and other signs favoring specified candidates in a forthcoming election for municipal offices. A proceeding is initiated against him to revoke his taxicab operator's license on the sole basis of that admitted conduct. In this proceeding, does Driver have a meritorious defense based on the United States Constitution?
1827	A thug approached the defendant in front of a bank, brandishing a gun. He told the defendant that he was going to rob the bank and needed a "bag man." The defendant complied at gunpoint, holding out a bag for the tellers to put money in while the thug waved the gun at everyone. The gun accidentally went off, killing one of the tellers. The defendant is charged with the criminal homicide of the teller. The most likely result is that the defendant will be found to be:
1828	Which of the following is LEAST likely to be the underlying felony in a prosecution for felony murder?
1829	Alex contracted for expensive cable television service for a period of six months solely to view the televised trial of Clark, who was on trial for murder in a court of the state of Green. In the midst of the trial, the judge prohibited any further televising of Clark's trial because he concluded that the presence of television cameras was disruptive. Alex brought an action in a federal district court against the judge in Clark's case asking only for an injunction that would require the judge to resume the televising of Clark's trial. Alex alleged that the judge's order to stop the televising of Clark's trial deprived him of property-his investment in cable television service-without due process of law. Before Alex's case came to trial, Clark's criminal trial concluded in a conviction and sentencing. There do not appear to be any obvious errors in the proceeding that led to the result in Clark's case. After Clark's conviction and sentencing, the defendant in Alex's case moved to dismiss that suit. The most proper disposition of this motion by the federal court would be to
1830	Police officers were executing a search warrant at a home suspected of containing evidence of illegal gambling. No one was at home when the police arrived. After searching the first floor, the officers went upstairs. A friend of the owner then entered the house carrying a briefcase. He set the briefcase on the floor, opened it, and then heard the officers. He became frightened, left the briefcase sitting in the middle of the floor, and hid in a closet. The police officers returned to the first floor and immediately spotted the briefcase, which they knew was not there earlier. Because the briefcase was open, the officers saw its contents-betting slips-and seized them. Because they knew that someone had entered the house since they arrived, they re-searched the first floor. They found the friend and informed him that he was under arrest, clapped handcuffs on him, and read him his Miranda warnings. One of the officers patted the friend down to check for weapons. The officer noticed a bulge in the friend's pocket. Although the officer knew that the bulge was unlikely to be a weapon, he reached into the pocket anyway, and discovered a package that appeared to be (and later proved to be) heroin. The friend was charged with possession of narcotics. At a suppression hearing, will the court agree with the public defender's contention that the friend's arrest was illegal?
1831	A gang member threatened to kill the defendant unless he robbed a convenience store and gave the proceedsto the gang member. The gang member also demanded at gunpoint that the defendant kill the clerk to prevent identification. In abject fear of his life, the defendant did everything that the gang member requested. If the defendant is arrested and charged with murder and robbery in a common law jurisdiction, what result?
1832	The defendant was on trial for murdering his mother, who was found dead in her bathtub. At trial, the prosecutor called the nurse of the defendant's aunt to testify to what the aunt told the nurse just before the aunt died of cancer. The nurse is prepared to testify that, shortly before she died, the aunt stated, "I know I don't have much longer to live, so I must tell someone what my nephew said to me yesterday. He told me that he was very angry with his mother and that he wanted to kill her and make it look like an accident!" Should this testimony be admitted?
1833	Hijackers of a truck carrying dog food were arrested and indicted by a grand jury. During the grand jury's investigation, the district attorney's office subpoenaed the truck driver as a witness. To her relief, she was not asked questions about a series of thefts of shipments of dog chewtoys that she was involved in, but believes that the subject might be brought up at trial by the defense lawyers. She is afraid that she likely will be fired if she invokes the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination on the witness stand, so she wants to avoid testifying at all at the trial, even if she is subpoenaed by the defense. As her lawyer, what advice should you give her about complying with a subpoena?
1834	A lawyer was appointed as an administrative judge to review claims against the federal government made by Native Americans under a congressional statute. For 20 years, the lawyer heard, reviewed, and arbitrated disputed claims made against the government by various Indian tribes and their citizens. When the lawyer found a claim to be valid, he would make a recommendation to the Bureau of Indian Claims that the claim be paid. If the lawyer found the claims to be without merit, or if the Bureau decided against his recommendation, the claimant would have the right to bring suit in a federal court. Last year, a presidential commission recommended the abolition of the Bureau of Indian Claims as a cost-cutting measure. Congress acted on this recommendation and repealed the statute. The lawyer was offered a position as an attorney in the Department of Transportation, but he turned it down and brought suit against the government. What is the likely result of this suit?
1835	Electco operates a factory that requires the use of very high voltage electricity. Paul owns property adjacent to the Electco plant where he has attempted to carry on a business that requires the use of sensitive electronic equipment. The effectiveness of Paul's electronic equipment is impaired by electrical interference arising from the high voltage currents used in Electco's plant. Paul has complained to Electco several times, with no result. There is no way that Electco, by taking reasonable precautions, can avoid the interference with Paul's operation that arises from the high voltage currents necessary to Electco's operation. In Paul's action against Electco to recover damages for the economic loss caused to him by the electrical interference, will Paul prevail?
1836	Motorist arranged to borrow his friend Owner's car to drive for one day while Motorist's car was being repaired. Owner knew that the brakes on his car were faulty and might fail in an emergency. Owner forgot to tell Motorist about the brakes when Motorist picked up the car, but Owner did telephone Spouse, Motorist's wife, and told her about them. Spouse, however, forgot to tell Motorist. Motorist was driving Owner's car at a reasonable rate of speed and within the posted speed limit, with Spouse as passenger. Another car, driven by Cross, crossed in front of Motorist at an intersection and in violation of the traffic signal. Motorist tried to stop, but the brakes failed, and the two cars collided. If the brakes had been in proper working order, Motorist could have stopped in time to avoid the collision. Motorist and Spouse were injured. If the jurisdiction has adopted "pure" comparative negligence and Spouse asserts a claim against Cross, Spouse will
1837	An attorney came to work on a Saturday. When he signed in, he was advised by the morning security guard employed by the building management that he must be out of the building by 5 p.m., when it closes. However, he stayed past 5 p.m. to complete a brief that had to be filed on Monday morning. At 5:15 p.m., the afternoon security guard set the locks on all the doors of the building and left. Because she was in a hurry, she did not check the sign-in sheet to make sure that everyone had signed out, contrary to mandatory procedures. When the attorney tried to exit 15 minutes later, he discovered that the doors were all locked and could not be opened from the inside. He used his cell phone to call for help, and a supervisor from the building arrived and let him out shortly thereafter. If the attorney sues the building management for false imprisonment, he will likely:
1838	A dump truck driver was driving a dump truck at a safe speed. From the other direction a semitrailer driver came around a curve and was confronted with a very slow-moving steamroller just in front of him. To avoid colliding with the steamroller, the semitrailer driver pulled his wheel to the left and crossed the center lane, where he bore down on the dump truck driver, who was coming from the other direction. The semitrailer driver did not yield, and there were other vehicles to the dump truck driver's left. The dump truck driver's only option was to turn his truck to the right, onto another person's land. The truck caused damage to the landowner's lawn. Which of the following best describes the dump truck driver's liability to the landowner?
1839	Peterson sued Dylan for libel. After Peterson testified that Dylan wrote to Peterson's employer that Peterson was a thief, Dylan offers evidence that Peterson once stole money from a former employer. The evidence of Peterson's prior theft is
1840	A state enacted a statute to provide financial aid for residents of the state who attend public or private colleges and universities in the state. Under this statute, eligible students receive varying amounts of money, depending on need. A student living in the state who has never paid taxes applied for a grant of funds under this statute to attend a private college in a different state. His application was denied because the college was outside of his home state. The student filed suit in federal court against the appropriate state official, challenging the constitutionality of the denial on equal protection grounds and to compel the granting of his application. Which of the following statements is most correct?
1841	An electrical engineer designed an electronic game. The engineer entered into a licensing agreement with a manufacturer under which it agreed to manufacture the game according to the engineer's specifications and to market it and pay a royalty to the engineer. A girl whose parents had purchased the game for her was injured while playing with the game. The girl recovered a judgment against the manufacturer on the basis of a finding that the game was defective because of the engineer's improper design. Evidence was also presented that the manufacturer could have discovered the defect by reasonable inspection. In a claim for indemnity against the engineer, will the manufacturer prevail?
1842	As Seller, an encyclopedia salesman, approached the grounds on which Hermit's house was situated, he saw a sign that said, "No salesmen. Trespassers will be prosecuted. Proceed at your own risk." Although Seller had not been invited to enter, he ignored the sign and drove up the driveway toward the house. As he rounded a curve, a powerful explosive charge buried in the driveway exploded, and Seller was injured. Can Seller recover damages from Hermit for his injuries?
1843	A landowner died, devising her property "to my sister for life, then to my son." A small stream divided the property into a one-acre lot and a quarter-acre lot. The sister moved into the home on the one-acre lot. To access the quarteracre lot, the sister installed a footbridge. Ten years later, the bridge had deteriorated and was no longer safe to use. After the sister refused to repair the bridge, the son filed a suit against the sister for damages. The jurisdiction has no applicable statute on the matter. In such action, should damages be awarded to the son?
1844	On February 3, a property owner mailed an offer to a married couple who had expressed an interest in buying his property at 337 Green Street, consisting of a house and lot. The offer asked for $200,000, "terms $60,000 cash, with the balance secured by a first mortgage." The offer reached the couple on February 5. On February 8, the couple replied by fax that the offer had been received and was being considered, and added, "We would much prefer a straight cash deal. Would you consider an immediate purchase for $180,000 cash?" On February 10, this reply was received by the property owner, who responded with a one-word fax: "No." Receiving this fax on February 11, the couple faxed: "Fax received. We accept your offer of February 3. Tender the deed c/o our agent, The First National Bank and Trust." If the property owner now refuses to sell and the couple sues, the court would probably hold:
1845	A manufacturer built a speedboat that it sold through an independent dealership. One day, the boat's owner was racing the boat dangerously close to shore in a misguided effort to impress some sunbathers on the beach. The owner was heading straight for the beach and then attempted to turn quickly away, but the steering failed and the boat crashed onto shore, injuring a sunbather. The sunbather asserts a claim based on negligence against the manufacturer. At trial, she presents evidence of the above facts and evidence that the steering failure resulted from a defect in the boat that was present when it left the manufacturer. At the end of the sunbather's case, the manufacturer moves for a directed verdict. The court should:
1846	Dunbar and Balcom went into a drugstore, where Dunbar reached into the cash register and took out $200. Stone, the owner of the store, came out of a back room, saw what had happened, and told Dunbar to put the money back. Balcom then took a revolver from under his coat and shot and killed Stone. If Dunbar is prosecuted for murder on the basis of felony murder and the jury believes her claim, she should be found
1847	The owner of a soon-to-be-opened pastry shop wrote to a large supplier of premium confectioner's sugar about placing a standing order for sugar to meet the pastry shop's frosting and other needs. By return mail, the supplier offered the shop owner a discounted price of $5 per five-pound bag-$3 per bag less than its regular price-based on the parties' "many years of pleasant business association." Because the shop owner had not done business with the supplier before, she realized that the supplier had confused her shop with another pastry shop having a similar name. However, the shop owner kept quiet about the mixup and placed an order for 200 bags of sugar at the discounted price of $5 per bag. Shortly before it shipped the sugar to the shop owner, the supplier discovered that it was mistaken about the identity of the shop owner and that the order was for a new pastry shop that was opening soon. It sent an overnight letter to the shop owner noting its mistake and stating that the price of a bag of premium confectioner's sugar was $8 per bag. The shop owner, whose grand opening was coming soon, sent the supplier $1,600 and received the 200 bags of confectioner's sugar in a timely manner. Immediately thereafter, the shop owner filed suit against the supplier for $600 (the difference in price between cost of the sugar at $5 per bag and its cost at $8 per bag) plus any consequential damages. In her pleadings, the shop owner asserted that the supplier violated its contract to sell the sugar at $5 per bag and that it had forced her to pay the higher amount knowing that she needed the sugar for her pastry shop to open. Will the shop owner win her suit?
1848	A statute provides "any person who knowingly sells intoxicating liquor to a person under 21 years of age is guilty of a misdemeanor and may be fined $1,000 or sentenced to up to six months in jail, or both." A patron ordered a drink at a bar. The bartender asked for some identification, and the patron produced a driver's license stating that he was 25 years old. In fact, the patron was only 18 years old, but he had some gray hair and was balding. A plainclothes police officer sitting at the bar witnessed the bartender selling a drink to the patron. The officer knew that the patron was under 21 years old, and demanded to see the patron's driver's license. The officer determined it to be false and arrested the bartender for violation of the statute. The bartender will be found:
1849	Ted frequently visited Janet, his next-door neighbor. Janet was separated from her husband, Howard. Howard resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which Janet resided. Late one night, Teo and Janet were sitting on the bed in Janet's bedroom drinking when Howard burst through the door and told Ted, "Get out I" When Ted refused, Howard challenged him to go outside and "fight it out." Ted again refused. Howard then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at Ted. Ted grabbed a lamp, struck Howard on the head, and killed him. Ted is charged with murder. On a charge of murder, Ted should be found
1850	On a camping trip in a state park, Rose discovered metal signs near a rubbish heap stating, "Natural Wildlife Area-No Hunting." She took two of the signs and used them to decorate her room at home. She is charged with violation of a state statute which provides, "Any person who appropriates to his own use property owned by the state shall be guilty of a crime and shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000, or by imprisonment for not more than five years, or by both such fine and imprisonment." At trial, Rose admits taking the signs but says she believedI they had been thrown away. In fact, the signs had not been abandoned. Rose should be found
1851	Ann's three-year-old daughter, Janet, was killed in an automobile accident. At Ann's direction, Janet's body was taken to a mausoleum for interment. Normally, the mausoleum's vaults are permanently sealed with marble plates secured by "tamper-proof' screws. After Janet's body was placed in the mausoleum, however, only a fiberglass panel secured by caulking compound covered her vault. About a month later, Janet's body was discovered in a cemetery located near the mausoleum. It had apparently been left there by vandals who had taken it from the mausoleum. As a result of this experience, Ann suffered great emotional distress. If Ann sues the mausoleum for the damages arising from her emotional distress, will she prevail?
1852	The owner of a jewelry store brought a civil action against a former clerk for the value of various pieces of jewelry missing from the store. The defendant had been fired after another employee had reported that the defendant was stealing jewelry. At the trial, the plaintiff calls his employee as a witness. The witness testifies that he does not remember either having seen the defendant take anything from the store or having told the plaintiff that she had done so. The plaintiff then takes the witness stand and proposes to testify to what the witness had told him about seeing the defendant stealing pieces of jewelry from the store. Assuming appropriate objection by the defendant, such testimony by the plaintiff would be:
1853	A property owner decided that she would turn the garage on her property into an exercise area, including a modern sauna and spa. She entered into a written agreement with a contractor who agreed to do the job personally for $12,500, which included all requisite plumbing, electrical, and carpentry work. The contractor was to begin work by May 14. On May 15, he had not yet appeared to start the job. The property owner telephoned the contractor, who told her that he was hired for a big job that was going to pay him "a lot more money than that marginal project of yours, so I'm not going to work on your garage." Over a period of several months, the property owner made many calls to local contractors, but none of them would agree to do the job for the price agreed upon by the original contractor. On June 3 of the following year, the property owner filed suit for specific performance against the original contractor. Which of the following represents the contractor's best argument in his defense against the property owner's suit?
1854	Citizen groups proposed the merger of a large town of 60,000 residents with an adjacent small town of 30,000. To allay fears of residents of the small town that control of the government would be in the hands of the more populous town, the proposal would establish three council districts of 20,000 persons each in the large town and three districts of 10,000 persons each in the small town for a period of 20 years. Each district would elect one representative to the six-person town council, and the mayor would be elected at large. The proposal carried by large majorities in both towns, and representatives from both towns proceeded to carve each former city into three council electoral districts. Three taxpayers from the large town filed suit to enjoin the holding of an election with council districts of such disparate proportions. Which of the following represents the plaintiffs' best constitutional argument?
1855	A farmer employed a 16-year-old high school student for a summer agricultural labor job. One afternoon, a violent storm suddenly erupted as the farmer was driving a tractor up a hill in an open field with the student in the wagon behind. When loud claps of thunder erupted, the farmer stopped his tractor, jumped off without saying anything, and ran swiftly down the hill toward the low ground, which he knew would be safer. The student, who lived in a nearby city and had never seen an electrical storm in open country (except as a passenger inside an automobile), had never been told how to act safely during such a storm. Once the storm began, the student was struck by lightning and seriously injured as he stood at the crest of the hill watching the farmer run. Is the farmer liable to the student for the injuries caused by lightning?
1856	Paul and Daniel entered a contract in writing on November 1, the essential part of which read as follows: "Paul to supply Daniel with 200 personalized Christmas cards on or before December 15, 1970, bearing photograph of Daniel and his family, and Daniel to pay $100 thirty days thereafter. Photograph to be taken by Paul at Daniel's house. Cards guaranteed to be fully satisfactory and on time." Because Daniel suddenly became ill, Paul was unable to take the necessary photograph of Daniel and his family until the first week of December. The final week's delay was caused by Paul's not being notified promptly by Daniel of his recovery. Before taking the photograph of Daniel and his family, Paul advised Daniel that he was likely to be delayed a day or two beyond December 15 in making delivery because of the time required to process the photograph and cards. Daniel told Paul to take the photograph anyway. The cards were finally delivered by Paul to Daniel on December 17, Paul having diligently worked on them in the interim. Although the cards pleased the rest of the family, Daniel refused to accept them because, as he said squinting at one of the cards at arm's length without bothering to put on his reading glasses, "The photograph makes me look too old. Besides, the cards weren't delivered on time." In an action by Paul against Daniel, which of the following would be Daniel's best defense?
1857	A testator executed a will, devising his land "to my son and my daughter, share and share alike." Shortly thereafter, the daughter died intestate, leaving a child as her only heir. The next year, the testator and his son were involved in a car accident. The testator died immediately. The son died six days later, leaving a will that bequeathed his entire estate to his wife. The jurisdiction has the following statute: "If a devisee, including a devisee of a class gift, who is a grandparent or a lineal descendant of a grandparent of the testator is dead at the time of execution of the will or fails to survive the testator, the issue of such deceased devisee shall take the deceased's share under the will." Who owns the land?
1858	An accountant employed by the Federal Communications Commission was offended by various jokes and cartoons that employees would post in the office cafeteria. The Commission did not have any rules regarding what employees could post in the cafeteria, and none of the cartoons were pornographic or harassing. Nevertheless, the accountant lodged a number of complaints with his supervisor that went unheeded. Finally, the accountant posted his own notice chastising the hypocrisy and immorality of the agency for allowing such cartoons when it was charged with ensuring a standard of decency on the public airwaves. The notice prompted a great deal of debate among employees and a great deal of displeasure on the part of the accountant's supervisor, particularly after it was posted on another employee's blog and received some media attention. A labor contract between the agency and the clerical workers' union contained a policy for providing for termination of union employees only for certain specified grounds, but the accountant was not a member of the union and was not covered by the policy or any other employment agreement. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the agency's right to dismiss the accountant?
1859	A 12-year-old child was injured in an automobile accident. The child's father brought the child to see an attorney to bring suit against the defendant. During the paid consultation with the attorney, the seriousness of the child's injuries was discussed with candor. After the discussion, the attorney told the father and child that they would be better off with a lawyer who specialized in personal injury work. Eventually, another attorney was hired to bring the child's lawsuit against the defendant. Defense counsel has reason to believe that the child's injuries are not serious at all. She therefore subpoenas the first attorney for an oral deposition. During the course of the deposition she asks the attorney about his discussion with the child regarding the child's injuries. May the attorney invoke the attorney-client privilege?
1860	Rider, a bus passenger, sued Transit Company for injuries to his back from an accident caused by Transit's negligence. Transit denies that Rider received any injury in the accident. Transit Company calls Observer to testify that right after the accident, Rider told hin that he had recently suffered a recurrence of an old back injury. The judge should rule Observer's testimony
1861	Seller and Buyer execute an agreement for the sale of real property on September 1, 1971. The jurisdiction in which the property is located recognizes the principle of equitable conversion and has no statute pertinent to this problem. Assume for this question only that Buyer dies before closing, there being no breach of the agreement by either party. Which of the following is appropriate in most jurisdictions?
1862	Questions 35-36 are based on the four case summaries below. For each question, select the case that would be most applicable as a precedent.  Jones, angry at a neighbor with whom he had quar. reled, for revenge surreptitiously removed a piece of stone statuary from the neighbor's garden and concealed it in his garage. He intended to return it a day or two later, after giving the neighbor a chance to feel bad over its being stolen. Suspecting who was guilty, the neighbor had Jones arrested and charged with larceny.
1863	A proud grandfather who planned to take pictures of his grandson's graduation purchased a camera from a camera store. He used the camera on several occasions over the next few weeks without incident, but when he used it on the day before his grandson's graduation, it caught fire and exploded, burning him and destroying an expensive coat he was wearing. Although the grandfather was in a great deal of pain because of his injuries, he insisted on attending his grandson's graduation. However, because he no longer had a workable camera, the grandfather hired a professional photographer to take pictures of the special day. In a breach of warranty action, which of the following represents the most that the grandfather may recover?
1864	Doctor, a resident of the city of Greenville in the state of Green, is a physician licensed to practice in both Green and the neighboring state of Red. Doctor finds that the most convenient place to treat her patients who need hospital care is in the publicly owned and operated Redville Municipal Hospital of the city of Redville in the state of Red, which is located just across the state line from Greenville. For many years Doctor had successfully treated her patients in that hospital. Early this year she was notified that she could no longer treat patients in the Redville hospital because she was not a resident of Red, and a newly adopted rule of Redville Municipal Hospital, which was adopted in conformance with all required procedures, stated that every physician who practices in that hospital must be a resident of Red. Which of the following constitutional provisions would be most helpful to Doctor in an action to challenge her exclusion from the Redville hospital solely on the basis of this hospital rule?
1865	A woman consulted with an acupuncturist regarding her intractable back pain. They entered into an agreement under which the acupuncturist promised to treat the woman for her back pain. However, no price was given for the treatment. Four months later, after weekly sessions with the acupuncturist, the woman's back pain was completely gone. The woman refused to pay the acupuncturist anything, and he brought suit against her for services rendered. The acupuncturist will:
1866	A developer entered into a written contract to buy a parcel of land from a farmer at a price of $160,000. At the time the contract was entered into, the developer gave the farmer $10,000 earnest money. The closing date was set for April 29. On April 17, the developer's attorney conducted a title search, during which the attorney discovered that the farmer's distant cousin had a legitimate claim to a one-tenth undivided interest in the land. On April 26, the developer paid the cousin $10,000, and the cousin gave the developer a quitclaim deed, surrendering any and all interest the cousin had in the land. The developer informed the farmer of the situation. On April 29, the developer appeared at the title company's office and tendered a certified check to the closing officer, but the farmer never appeared at the closing. The developer asked the closing officer to place the certified check in escrow and promptly sued the farmer for specific performance. Will the developer prevail in his specific performance action?
1867	A father lent his car to his son so that he could take his girlfriend out to dinner. Before he left, the father warned the son that the gas gauge failed to indicate when the car ran out of gas and told him to fill up the tank on the way to dinner. Running late, the son decided he would pick up gas on the way home. At dinner the son had too much to drink and asked his girlfriend to drive on the way home because she did not have anything to drink. Because the son was drunk, he forgot to tell his girlfriend to stop for gas. While going through an intersection, the car stalled because it ran out of gas. A driver, who ran a stop sign, crashed into the car. If the car had not run out of gas, the car would not have stalled in the middle of the intersection. The son and his girlfriend were injured. The jurisdiction has adopted "pure" comparative negligence. If the son asserts a claim against the driver, the son will:
1868	A state requires all businesses engaged in any form of retail sales to be licensed. The state legislature amended the statutes governing licensing so that any business seeking a retail sales license must establish that at least 40% of the items sold will be manufactured or produced within the state. Which of the following constitutional provisions will provide the best basis on which to attack the validity of the state licensing provision requiring a minimum percentage of local goods?
1869	A plainclothes police officer who frequently ate lunch at a certain deli heard rumors that the deli's owner often placed illegal bets on sporting events. Based on the rumors, the officer peeked into an envelope next to the register and saw betting slips. The officer asked his waitress about the envelope, and she told him that the owner had given it to her and that a man in a brown cap was to pick it up at 2 p.m. The officer stayed at the deli until 2 p.m. and watched the waitress hand the envelope to a man in a brown cap. The officer passed the above information on to a friend in the F.B.I. Several weeks later, based on that information, F.B.I. agents obtained a search warrant for the owner's home-a condominium in a large multi-unit complex. The agents went to the home in the early evening, while the owner was at the deli. After announcing their purpose to the owner's wife, they searched the home and found betting slips and other materials related to illegal gambling. The owner was indicted for conspiracy to violate a federal statute prohibiting the use of interstate phone lines to conduct gambling, and for the possession of betting slips. Which of the following would be the best reason for excluding the evidence found at the owner's home?
1870	Buyem faxed the following signed message to Zeller, his long-time widget supplier: "Urgently need blue widgets. Ship immediately three gross at your current list price of $600." Upon receipt of the fax, Zeller shipped three gross of red widgets to Buyem, and faxed to Buyem the following message: "Temporarily out of blue. In case red will help, am shipping three gross at the same price. Hope you can use them." Upon Buyem's timely receipt of both the shipment and Zeller's fax, which of the following best describes the rights and duties of Buyem and Zeller?
1871	A homeowner hired a contractor to make some improvements on his house. They entered into a written contract providing that the contractor would do the improvements for $5,000. Shortly after the contract was signed, the contractor told the homeowner to give the money to his (the contractor's) daughter when the job was finished, adding, "She is getting married soon and I want her to have a nice wedding present from me." The daughter was aware that her father made this statement to the homeowner. She married, but soon thereafter the contractor told the homeowner to pay him the $5,000, and not the daughter, because his son-inlaw had a gambling problem and would probably use the money to bet at the racetrack. What is the best argument in favor of the daughter's being able to enforce a contract for $5,000 in her favor?
1872	A man and woman agreed to burn down a neighbor's house in retribution for some wrong the neighbor allegedly committed against them. Both the man and woman were arrested shortly after they poured gasoline on the neighbor's front porch. The man revealed to the police that he participated in the plan to ensure that nothing bad would happen to the neighbor, and that he had made an anonymous telephone call to the police alerting them to the crime, which enabled the police to arrest him and the woman "in the act." The woman stated that she would not have participated if not for the man's encouragement. If charged with a conspiracy at common law to commit arson, the woman should be found:
1873	In late January, the manager of a grocery store announced via flyers and in the local newspaper that he would award a $700 in-store gift certificate to any shopper who generated more than $3,000 in sales on their store credit card for goods purchased in the store in the month of February. A woman with a large family who regularly shopped at the store decided that she had a good chance to win the contest, so she bought a large deep freezer for $300 so she could buy food in bulk and store it at home. She then began buying large quantities of food and racking up purchases on her store credit card that were substantially higher than her usual monthly expenditures. had not increased enough to justify the cost of awarding the gift certificate, so he again put up flyers and took out an ad in the local newspaper, this time to announce that the contest was canceled. Although the woman saw the flyers, she continued to make larger than normal purchases at the store. At the end of the month, she had totaled more than $3,000 in purchases on her store credit card, but the store manager declined to give her the gift certificate. If the woman sues for breach of contract, will she prevail?
1874	In an effort to curb underage drinking, the police staked out a liquor store near a college campus that was suspected of selling liquor to minors in violation of state law. They recorded a liquor store clerk being told by a minor that he was an underage student at the local university and that he would pay triple the marked price for a case of beer. The clerk readily agreed to the deal, but both parties were arrested before they could complete the transaction. In a jurisdiction following the unilateral approach to conspiracy, which of the following statements is correct?
1875	A restaurant patron looked up from her dinner and saw that another woman had taken her coat and was walking out the door with it. The patron quickly left and followed the woman, and saw the woman enter a nearby house. Later, when the patron knew that nobody was in the house, she opened a window to the house, climbed in, and got what she thought was her coat out of the front closet. When she put the coat on, however, she noticed for the first time that the coat was not her coat. But, because it was so cold outside, she decided to wear this coat home and to return it the next day. The following day she changed her mind and decided to keep the coat. The patron is guilty of:
1876	Defendant is charged with assault and battery. The state's evidence shows that Victim was struck in the face by Defendant's fist. In which of the following situations is Defendant most likely to be not guilty of assault and battery?
1877	Paul, the Plaintiff in a personal injury action, called Wes as a witness to testify that Dan's car, in which Paul had been riding. ran a red light. Wes, however, testified that Dan's car did not run the light. Dan called Zemo as a witness and asked him if he knew Vic's reputation for veracity in the community where Vic resided. The trialjudge should rule that this question is
1878	Deetz was prosecuted for homicide. He testified that he shot in self-defense. In rebuttal, Officer Watts testified that he came to the scene in response to a telephone call from Deetz. Watts offers to testify that he asked, "What is the problem here, sir?" and Deetz replied, "I was cleaning my gun and it went off accidentally." The offered testimony is
1879	After a bitter custody battle, the court dissolving a marriage ordered that the mother had sole custody of her three-year-old son. The father was allowed to have his son for visitation purposes, which included two weeks every summer. During the first summer visitation period, the father took his son to stay with the father's parents. When the two-week period ended, both the father and his son disappeared from sight. Under an assumed name, the father leased a poultry farm in a rural area and kept his son there. His son enjoyed living on the farm and helping collect eggs and doing other activities with his dad. The mother tried to find the father but was unable to learn of his whereabouts. Two years after the son and the father's disappearance, one of the father's neighbors saw the son's picture in a television program about missing children. The neighbor notified local police and the son and his mother were reunited. If the mother files suit on her son's behalf seeking damages from the father for false imprisonment, who will prevail?
1880	A state legislature passed a law requiring all employers operating in the state's oil and natural gas fields to give preference in hiring to residents of that state. The bill banned the hiring of nonresidents unless no other qualified person could be found to fill an oilfield or natural gas field position. Under prevailing economic conditions, which included a substantial decline in petroleum prices, the statute was tantamount to a total ban on hiring of nonresidents because there were so many unemployed oil and gas workers and little new exploration was taking place. The plaintiff was an experienced oilfield worker who was denied a job in the state because his permanent residence was in another state, even though he had worked in many states and foreign countries and his qualifications were better than anyone else applying for the job. The sole reason given for not hiring the plaintiff was the preferential hiring statute favoring state residents. The plaintiff filed suit in federal district court challenging the statute. The court should rule in favor of:
1881	A farmer owned a 70-acre farm on the outskirts of a rapidly growing town. She conveyed the farm to a developer by a deed that contained no restrictions. The developer divided the property into two tracts, a 40-acre parcel and a 30-acre parcel. He then subdivided the 40-acre parcel into 80 half-acre lots and put them on the market. Under the town's liberal land-use provisions, there was no zoning code limitation on the use of either parcel, nor was the developer required to file a plat map with local officials. However, the deed that each purchaser of a halfacre lot received contained a clause restricting the use of the lot to "no more than one singlefamily dwelling and one garage." In addition, the developer gave every prospective purchaser a brochure depicting the 80-lot subdivision on its completion, with a drawing of a house on each lot. The lots sold briskly and soon a number of homes were constructed thereon. Two years later, an original owner of one of the lots sold his home to a buyer. The buyer's deed did not contain the restrictive covenant. Soon after, when the last subdivision lot was sold, the developer sold the adjacent 30-acre parcel to a car dealer by a deed that contained no restrictions as to the use of the parcel. Two weeks after the buyer moved into her home, the car dealer began building an auto mall on his parcel. The buyer was angry that the busy mall was to be right next door to her home. She filed suit against the car dealer to enjoin his construction of the auto mall. Which of the following is the best argument in the car dealer's defense?
1882	Ann leased commercial property to Brenda for a period of ten years. The lease contained the following provision: "No subleasing or assignment will be permitted unless with the written consent of the lessor." One year later, Brenda assigned all interest in the lease to Carolyn, who assumed and agreed to perform the lessee's obligations under the terms of the lease. Ann learned of the assignment and wrote to Brenda that she had no objection to the assignment to Carolyn and agreed to accept rent from Carolyn instead of Brenda. Thereafter, Carolyn paid rent to Ann for a. period of five years. Carolyn then defaulted and went into bankruptcy. In an appropriate action, Ann sued Brenda for rent due. If Ann loses, it will be because there was
1883	A boy was arrested for shoplifting. His mother was consoling him at the police station when a reporter for a daily newspaper took her picture. The photograph appeared on the front page of the next day's edition of the paper, above the story of the boy's arrest. A caption to the photograph identified her as the boy's mother. Later that week, the mother lost her job as a result of the story in the paper. If the mother asserts a claim against the newspaper for invasion of privacy, she will:
1884	Mary Webb, a physician, called as a witness by the defendant in the case of Parr v. Doan, was asked to testify to statements mTd by Michael Zadok, her patient, for the purpose of obtaining treatment from Dr. Webb. Which of the following is the best basis for excluding evidence of Zadok's statements in a jurisdiction with a doctor-patient privilege?
1885	In an action to recover for personal injuries arising out of an automobile accident, the plaintiff calls a bystander to testify. Claiming the privilege against self-incrimination, the bystander refuses to answer a question as to whether she was at the scene of the accident. The plaintiff moves that the bystander be ordered to answer the question. The judge should allow the bystander to
1886	Matt and his friend Fred were watching a football game at Matt's home when they began to argue. Fred became abusive, and Matt asked him to leave. Fred refused, walked into the kitchen, picked up a knife, and said he would cut Matt's heart out. Matt pulled a gun from under the sofa, walked to his front door, opened it, and again told Fred to leave. Fred again refused. Instead, he walked slowly toward Matt, brandishing the knife in a threatening manner. Matt, rather than running out the door himself, shot in Fred's direction, intending only to scare him. However, the bullet struck Fred, killing him instantly. Charged with murder, Matt should be
1887	Congress provides by statute that any state that fails to prohibit automobile speeds of over 55 miles per hour on highways within the state shall be denied all federal highway construction funding. The state of Atlantic, one of the richest and most highway-oriented states in the country, refuses to enact such a statute. Which of the following potential plaintiffs is most likely to be able to obtain a judicial determination of the validity of this federal statute?
1888	Two mothers were talking outside of a school one afternoon. One of them asked the other for the phone number of the woman she employed in her home to take care of her children. That mother, knowing that reliable childcare is hard to find, did not want to share the information with the other woman, so she instead said, "You don't want her number, we discovered that she was intoxicated last week when we came home from work." This accusation was false, but it quickly spread throughout the neighborhood. If the woman sues the mother for defamation and establishes the above facts, the woman must also show:
1889	A defendant is on trial in federal court for the armed robbery of a casino. The defendant claims that he was out of town at the time of the robbery. The defendant calls an alibi witness to the stand to testify that she was with him on the trip. When asked where she was and who she was with on the date in question, the witness stated that she could not recall. She said she recalls spending a weekend at a bed and breakfast this spring, but she does not recall the date or her traveling companion. The defendant's attorney then showed the witness a letter written by her on stationery from the bed and breakfast, and asks her to look at it and try to answer the question again. The prosecution objects. The objection should be:
1890	A department store buyer and a manufacturer of food processors entered into a written contract whereby the manufacturer would sell to the buyer 50 of its top-of-the-line models for $100 each. When the delivery arrived on May 15, several days early, the buyer noticed that the food processors were a different model that did not have all of the features as the top-of-the-line model that was ordered. The buyer contacted the manufacturer and told him that he was rejecting the food processors that were delivered to him and expected the manufacturer to send 50 top-ofthe-line models immediately. The manufacturer replied that because of a backlog of orders that had not yet been filled, the top-of-the-line models could not be delivered until August 15. Because the department store had contracted with a restaurant to deliver three top-of-the-line models by May 31, the buyer delivered three of the nonconforming food processors along with a promise to replace them with three top-of-theline models in mid-August. The buyer returned the remaining food processors to the manufacturer. How much could the department store recover from the manufacturer for the three food processors that it delivered to the restaurant?
1891	One Saturday, the owner of an art gallery and her friend were discussing art after the friend had helped the owner move some furniture in her home. The friend mentioned that he was very fond of a particular artist. The gallery owner asked her friend if he would like to buy a painting by the artist, entitled "Tears of a Clown," recently consigned to the gallery. The friend said that he would love it, but he only had $2,700. The gallery owner told her friend that she would let him have the painting for that price. The friend knew that the painting was priced at $7,000. He immediately wrote out a check for $2,700 and gave it to the gallery owner, who told him to visit the gallery on Monday to pick up the painting. On Sunday, a salesperson at the gallery sold "Tears of a Clown" to a gallery customer. Neither the salesperson nor the customer knew of the agreement between the gallery owner and her friend. The customer took the painting with him on Sunday. When the friend arrived at the gallery on Monday, the painting was gone. Can the friend obtain specific performance from the gallery owner?
1892	A manufacturing company was in the business of making copper tubing. A retail seller telephoned the manufacturing company's sales department and placed an order for 10,000 linear feet of copper tubing at a sale price of $2 per foot. The tubing was to be used in the production of a custom order for one of the retail seller's customers. The manufacturing company installed special equipment for the manufacture of the tubing to the retail seller's specifications and had completed a portion of the order when the retail seller again telephoned the sales department. This time, however, the retail seller canceled its order, saying it no longer had need of the tubing because its customer had been declared bankrupt and refused to pay for the order. If the manufacturing company sues for breach, it will:
1893	Johnston bought 100 bolts of standard blue wool, No. I quality, from McHugh. The sale contract provided that Johnston would make payment prior to inspection. The 100 bolts were shipped, and Johnston paid McHugh. Upon inspection, however, Johnston discovered that the wool was No. 2 quality. Johnston thereupon tendered back the Wool to Mc Hugh and demanded return of his payment. Mc Hugh refused on the ground that there is no difference between No. 1 quality wool and No. 2 quality wool. Can Johnston resell the wool?
1894	To encourage the growth of its population, the state of Axbridge established a program that awarded $1,000 to the parents of each child born within the state, provided that at the time of the child's birth the mother and father of the newborn were citizens of the United States. The Lills are aliens who are permanent residents of the United States and have resided in Axbridge for three years. When their first child was born two months ago, they applied for and were denied the $1,000 award by Axbridge officials on the sole ground that they are not citizens of the United States. The Lills filed suit in federal court contending that their exclusion from the award program was unconstitutional. Assume no federal statute addresses this question. In this case, the court should hold that the exclusion of aliens from the Axbridge award program is
1895	In a civil action for personal injury, Payne alleges that he was beaten up by Dabney during an altercation in a crowded bar. Dabney's defense is that he was not the person who hit Payne. To corroborate his testimony about the cause of his injuries, Payne seeks to introduce, through the hospital records custodian, a notation in a regular medical record made by an emergency room doctor at the hospital where Payne was treated for his injuries. The notation is: "Patient says he was attacked by Dabney." The notation is
1896	State law required all businesses in the state to report any deposits of toxic waste discovered on property owned by the reporting firm. Another provision of the law required that the toxic waste reports be made on a specific state form and that duplicate copies of the form be filed with both the state department of labor and the state environmental protection agency. The statute provided that after each report was filed, the relevant state agencies would ensure that any dangerous area was cordoned off and work out a plan with the reporting firm for the clean-up of the waste deposit. The effective date of the statute was June 15, but the state office did not produce any of the special forms until July 6. The defendant, a safety inspector employed by a chemical company, was making her first visit to one of the company's plants on June 17 when she noticed a strange substance on the premises. The defendant filed no report to the state agencies regarding the substance because she was not aware of the requirement, nor did she know that the substance was toxic. On June 20, another employee of the chemical company was walking in an area near the substance when he slipped and fell face first into it. The substance turned out to be very toxic. The employee's skin contact with the substance was sufficient to kill him in a matter of minutes. A later investigation revealed that it would have been impossible to clean up the substance to make the area safe before the employee encountered it. If the defendant is charged with murder, which of the following represents her best defense?
1897	Big City High School has had a very high rate of pregnancy among its students. In order to assist students who keep their babies to complete high school, Big City High School has established an infant day-care center for children of its students, and also offers classes in child-care. Because the child-care classes are always overcrowded, the school limits admission to those classes solely to Big City High School students who are the mothers of babies in the infant day-care center. Joe, a student at Big City High School, has legal custody of his infant son. The school provides care for his son in its infant day-care center, but will not allow Joe to enroll in the child-care classes. He brings suit against the school challenging, on constitutional grounds, his exclusion from the child-care classes. Which of the following best states the burden of persuasion in this case?
1898	The mineral alpha is added to bodies of fresh water to prevent the spread of certain freshwater parasites. The presence of those parasites threatens the health of the organisms living in rivers and streams throughout the country and imperils the freshwater commercial fishing industry. Alpha is currently mined only in the state of Blue. In order to raise needed revenue, Congress recently enacted a statute providing for the imposition of a $100 tax on each ton of alpha mined in the United States. Because it will raise the cost of alpha, this tax is likely to reduce the amount of alpha added to freshwater rivers and streams and, therefore, is likely to have an adverse effect on the interstate freshwater commercial fishing industry. The alpha producers in Blue have filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging this tax solely on constitutional grounds. Is this tax constitutional?
1899	On March 1, a health food store owner and a health food distributor entered into a written agreement providing that the distributor would supply the store owner with his natural foods requirements over the next 12 months. In return, the store owner agreed to purchase only from the distributor. The agreement also provided that payment for any purchases made under the agreement during the month of April would be turned over to a nonprofit food research corporation, "to carry on its good works." On April 1, the store owner ordered and the distributor shipped 20 cases of health food products, at a wholesale price of $4,000, which remains unpaid. On April 15, the store owner sold his store, inventory, and accounts receivable to a chain operation that also sells health food products. As part of the sale, the store owner assigned to the chain operation the contract with the distributor. The chain operation promptly notified the distributor of the sale and assignment. The $4,000 for the April 1 transaction remained unpaid and, on May 31, the food research corporation commenced suit to collect the money. Against whom may the action be maintained?
1900	Spender owed Midas $1,000, plus interest at 8% until paid, on a long-overdue promissory note, collection of which would become barred by the statute of limitations on June 30. On the preceding April 1, Spender and Midas both signed a writing in which Spender promised to pay the note in full on the following December 31, plus interest at 8% until that date, and Midas promised not to sue on the note in the meantime. Midas, having received some advice from his nonlawyer brother-in-law, became concerned about the legal effect of the April 1 agreement. On May 1, acting pro se as permitted by the rules of the local small claims court, he filed suit to collect the note. For this question only, assume that on January 2 of the following year Midas's suit has not come to trial, Spender has not paid the note, Midas has retained a lawyer, and the lawyer, with leave of court, amends the complaint to add a second count to enforce the promise Spender made in the April 1 agreement. Does the new count state a claim upon which relief can be granted?
1901	Doe negligently caused a fire in his house, and the house burned to the ground. As a result, the sun streamed into Peter's yard next door, which previously had been shaded by Doe's house. The sunshine destroyed some delicate and valuable trees in Peter's yard that could grow only in the shade. Peter has brought a negligence action against Doe for the loss of Peter's trees. Doe has moved to dismiss the complaint. The best argument in support of this motion would be that
1902	As part of a program to meet the needs of a growing homeless population, a city council appropriated funds to construct a shelter and community center in the downtown area and sought bids from organizations interested in operating the center. The group submitting the lowest bid was a religious organization, which ran a number of shelters and food kitchens in adherence to the religion's central tenet of aiding the needy. While church members never actively preached to people using the shelters, it did make available reading materials about its religion. The only other bidder was a local nonprofit foundation not affiliated with any church. The nonprofit foundation concluded that it was underbid because it was subject to a state tax imposed on all facilities offering overnight lodging, whether run for profit or not for profit; the only exemption was for facilities run by an organized religion. If the nonprofit foundation seeks to challenge the application of the state tax to its operation of the homeless shelter, which of the following statements is most correct?
1903	A young boy was hospitalized after he accidentally swallowed a coin while playing. The boy recovered, but his mother began suffering feelings of anxiety, worrying that her child might be injured again. The mother went to a movie to relax and ordered some popcorn. While handling her change, the concession stand attendant carelessly dropped a quarter into the popcorn, which the mother did not notice until she bit the quarter. She did not swallow the quarter, nor did she bite on it hard enough to injure her teeth or gums, but the feel of the coin brought back all her anxieties about the boy's injury. The mother sued the movie theater for her emotional distress. If the jury finds that a reasonable person would not have suffered similar distress under the circumstances, the mother will:
1904	A developer prepared and duly recorded a subdivision plan, dividing his 200-acre tract of land into 80 two-acre lots with a 40-acre tract in the center designated "future public golf course." He began to market the 80 two-acre lots by preparing and distributing a brochure promoting the subdivision. The developer sold 70 of the lots to individual purchasers. Each deed referred to the recorded plan. Years later, wishing to rid himself of the remai n ing acreage, the developer sold the remaining 20 acres and the 40-acre tract to an investor by a deed that referred to the plan. The investor sold the 10 two-acre lots to individual purchasers and the 40-acre tract to a partnership. None of the deeds from the investor referred to the plan. The partnership has announced its intention of erecting a shopping mall on the 40-acre tract. A golfer, an owner of a two-acre lot purchased from the developer, brings suit to enjoin the partnership. If the golfer wins, it will be because:
1905	Husband and Wife, walking on a country road, were frightened by a bull running loose on the road. They climbed over a fence to get onto the adjacent property, owned by Grower. After climbing over the fence, Husband and Wife damaged some of Grower's plants which were near the fence. The fence was posted with a large sign, "No Trespassing." Grower saw Husband and Wife and came toward them with his large watchdog on a long leash. The dog rushed at Wife. Grower had intended only to frighten Husband and Wife, but the leash broke, and before Grower could restrain the dog, the dog bit Wife. If Wife asserts a claim based on battery against Grower, will Wife prevail?
1906	A decedent was prosecuted for criminal violations of a hazardous waste disposal act and convicted, in part on the testimony of a witness. After the decedent's death, the plaintiff on whose property the decedent dumped the hazardous waste brought suit to recover the cleanup costs against the executor of the decedent's estate. Because the witness is currently incarcerated in another state and beyond the reach of the court's subpoena powers, the plaintiff seeks to introduce the transcript of the witness's testimony from the decedent's criminal trial in the present action. The executor objects to its admission. The court should rule that the transcript is:
1907	Motorco is a manufacturer of motor vehicles. A federal regulation requires that all motor vehicles manufactured for sale in the United States be equipped with seat belts for each passenger and prescribes specifications for such belts. Motorco equipped all its cars with seat belts. It purchased all the bolts used in its seat belt assemblies from Boltco and it tested samples from each shipment received. Dunn purchased a motor vehicle manufactured by Motorco. While operating the car, with Price as a passenger in the front seat, Dunn collided with another vehicle. The collision was due solely to Dunn's negligence. Price had his seat belt fastened, but one of the bolts which anchored the belt to the frame broke. Price was thrown through the windshield, sustaining various injuries. Dunn, whose belt was fastened and held, was killed when, following the collision, the car went off the road, down an embankment, and overturned. Subsequent to the accident, tests of the bolt that broke showed metallurgical defects. Motorco's records showed that tests of samples from the shipment in which the defective bolt was received revealed no defective bolts. If there is a guest law in the state where the accident happened, then in any action by Price against Motorco, that guest statute has which of the following effects?
1908	John Doe, the owner of a milk container manufacturing firm, sought to focus public attention on the milk packaging law of the State of Clinton in order to have it repealed. On a weekday at 12:00 noon, he delivered an excited, animated, and loud harangue on the steps of the State Capitol in front of the main entryway. An audience of 200 onlookers, who gathered on the steps, heckled him and laughed as he delivered his tirade. Doe repeatedly stated, gesturing expressively and making faces, that "the g-ddamned milk packaging law is stupid," and that "I will strangle every one of those g-ddamned legislators I can get hold of because this law they created proves they are all too dumb to live." After about fifteen minutes, Doe stopped speaking, and the amused crowd dispersed. There are three relevant statutes of the State of Clinton. The first statute prohibits "all speech making, picketing, and public gatherings of every sort on the Capitol steps in front of the main entryway between 7:45 a.m. -8:15 a.m., 11:45 a.m. -12:15 p.m., 12:45 p.m. -1:15 p.m., and 4:45 p.m. -5:15 p.m., on Capitol working days." Which of the following possible plaintiffs other than Doe would be most likely to obtain an adjudication in a federal court on the validity of the "Capitol steps" statute?
1909	A pilot discovered that her twin engine plane was losing fuel at an alarming rate, caused by a latent defect in the fuel system. Realizing that she could not make it to an airport, she saw a highway off to her left and a lake farther off to her right, and decided to try an emergency landing on the highway. As she maneuvered over the highway, the plane's engine quit for good. The plane's wing clipped a car as it landed, causing the car to veer off the road and crash, injuring the driver. If the driver of the car brings an action for personal injuries against the pilot, judgment will be for:
1910	A state legislator was the chairman of a committee that disbursed funds to schools in the state for various projects. The federal government supplied a portion of the funds as part of a federal revenue sharing plan. The legislator was charged with a violation of federal law when he and his committee made a $10,000 grant for textbooks to a private school for whites only. The legislator's defense is that as chairman of this committee he was acting in the course of his legislative duties, and thus, immune from federal interference. The best argument that would support the legislator's constitutional claim is:
1911	A gambler owed his uncle $9,000, which was due on January 1. On January 15, the gambler offered to pay the uncle $8,000 if he would agree to accept the amount in full satisfaction of the $9,000 debt. The uncle agreed and the gambler paid him the $8,000. If the uncle then sues the gambler for $1,000, the uncle will:
1912	In 1940, Cattle Company paid $30,000 for a 150-acre tract of agricultural land well suited for a cattle feed lot. The tract was ten miles from the city of Metropolis, then a community of 50,000 people, and five miles from the nearest home. By 1976, the city limits extended to Cattle Company's feed lot, and the city had a population of 350,000. About 10,000 people lived within three miles of the cattle feeding operation. The Cattle Company land is outside the city limits and no zoning ordinance applies. The Cattle Company land is now worth $300,000, and $25,000 has been invested in buildings and pens. Cattle Company, conscious of its obligations to its neighbors, uses the best and most sanitary feed lot procedures, including chemical sprays, to keep down flies and odors and frequently removes manure. Despite these measures, residents of Metropolis complain of flies and odors. An action has been filed by five individual homeowners who live within half a mile of the Cattle Company feed lot. The plaintiffs' homes are valued currently at $25,000 to $40,000 each. Flies in the area are five to ten times more numerous than in other parts of Metropolis, and extremely obnoxious odors are frequently carried by the wind to the plaintiffs' homes. The flies and odors are a substantial health hazard. If plaintiffs assert a claim based on public nuisance, plaintiffs will
1913	In a criminal battery case brought against the defendant, the prosecutor asked the court to take judicial notice of the fact that a car driven from Chicago to Detroit has to cross state lines. The defense attorney raised no objection, and the judge declared that she was taking judicial notice of the fact as requested by the prosecution. The effect of such judicial notice is:
1914	At Devlin's trial for burglary, Jaron supported Devlin's alibi that they were fishing together at the time of the crime. On cross-examination, Jaron was asked whether his statement on a credit card application that he had worked for his present employer for the last five years was false. Jaron denied that the statement was false. The prosecutor then calls Wilcox, the manager of the company for which Jaron works, to testify that although Jaron had been first employed five years earlier and is now employed by the company, there had been a three-year period during which he had not been so employed. The testimony of Wilcox is
1915	A fashion student at a prestigious fashion design school bought a new sewing machine for $1,000 so that she would be more than adequately equipped for her design assignments. One day, her roommate loaned her sewing machine to their neighbor, as she had done on several prior occasions. Unfortunately, the neighbor caused extensive damage to the machine. The cost to repair the sewing machine was $400. If the fashion student sues her roommate the damage the neighbor caused to the sewir machine, what will be the result?
1916	A federal statute just signed into law by the President provided that school districts no longer needed to recognize the tenure of elementary school teachers-all tenured teachers would lose their status and would be treated the same as nontenured teachers. The effect of the law would be to allow all tenured teachers to be fired more easily if their performance was not adequate. The law also allowed the salaries of tenured teachers to be lowered, at least until a new contract with the teachers could be negotiated. The law had a two-year grace period before it was to take effect, to give schools and teachers time to adjust to the law; however, it specifically provided that once it is in effect, school board actions under the law supersede any existing contract terms. A public elementary school district is in the first year of a three-year union contract with its teachers. The school board has stated that it plans to abolish tenured positions as soon as the law takes effect. The union, believing that numerous terms of the contract will be invalidated when the law takes effect, filed an action in federal court on behalf of the teachers, asking for an injunction to prevent the school board from abolishing tenured positions and for a declaratory judgment stating that the law is invalid. Should the federal court hear the case?
1917	An owner of a parcel of land instructed his lawyer to draw up an instrument deeding the land to his friend's "nieces." The owner acknowledged the deed before a notary and signed it. As directed by the owner, the lawyer recorded the deed and then returned it to the owner. The owner put the deed in the drawer of his desk, intending to present it to the friend's nieces when they came to visit him next month. The following week, however, the owner died, leaving his daughter as his sole heir at law. The daughter discovered the deed to the land in the owner's desk. She filed an appropriate action to quiet title in the land, naming the friend's only two nieces as defendants. The only evidence presented at the trial was the deed itself, the evidence of recordation, and the lawyer's testimony regarding the owner's intent. The court should rule that the land is owned by:
1918	Paul and Daniel entered a contract in writing on November 1, the essential part of which read as follows: "Paul to supply Daniel with 200 personalized Christmas cards on or before December 15, 1970, bearing photograph of Daniel and his family, and Daniel to pay $100 thirty days thereafter. Photograph to be taken by Paul at Daniel's house. Cards guaranteed to be fully satisfactory and on time." Because Daniel suddenly became ill, Paul was unable to take the necessary photograph of Daniel and his family until the first week of December. The final week's delay was caused by Paul's not being notified promptly by Daniel of his recovery. Before taking the photograph of Daniel and his family, Paul advised Daniel that he was likely to be delayed a day or two beyond December 15 in making delivery because of the time required to process the photograph and cards. Daniel told Paul to take the photograph anyway. The cards were finally delivered by Paul to Daniel on December 17, Paul having diligently worked on them in the interim. Although the cards pleased the rest of the family, Daniel refused to accept them because, as he said squinting at one of the cards at arm's length without bothering to put on his reading glasses, "The photograph makes me look too old. Besides, the cards weren't delivered on time." Which of the following statements regarding the legal effect of Daniel's illness is LEAST accurate?
1919	A patient who was mentally incompetent and a ward of the state received extensive rehabilitation for leg and back injuries she suffered in a fall at a state institution. After her rehabilitation was nearly completed, she became entitled to state payments as compensation for her injury, which her treatment center began applying to her outstanding rehabilitation bill. Thereafter, the legal guardian for the patient sought to remove her from the center despite the fact that the patient had never shown any desire to leave. The director of the center was aware that her departure would prevent the center from directly applying the state payments to her bill. The director was erroneously advised by his attorney that judicial decisions would support his refusal of the guardian's request until the bill was paid. When the guardian arrived at the center, the director refused to allow the guardian to remove the patient. A criminal statute in the jurisdiction defines false imprisonment as knowingly confining a person without valid consent and without authority of law. If the director is arrested and charged with false imprisonment, can he be found guilty?
1920	A contract between an investor and an inventor stated that the investor will finance all of the inventor's expenses for the next six months in exchange for half of the profits from any inventions that the inventor develops during that time. During those six months, the investor runs into financial problems and borrows $200,000 from a bank. The investor executes a written instrument providing that the bank "is entitled to collect the debt from my share of the profits, if any, under the inventor contract." The bank gave prompt notice of this transaction to the inventor. If the inventor thereafter refuses to account for any profits to the bank and the bank sues the inventor for the investor's share of profits then realized, the inventor's strongest argument in defense is that:
1921	On November 7, a painter agreed with a homeowner to paint his house for $10,000, payment to be made upon completion of the job. On November 14, while the job was still incomplete, the painter told her paint supplier that if he would give her the paint she needed, she would have the homeowner pay to him directly the $3,000 for paint that she owed him. The paint supplier agreed, and the painter sent the homeowner a letter setting forth this agreement. On December 1, the painter had completed the job, but the homeowner refused to pay the paint supplier any money. In a suit by the paint supplier against the homeowner, what would be the homeowner's best defense?
1922	The state of Champlain enacts the Young Adult Marriage Counseling Act, which provides that, before any persons less than 30 years of age may be issued a marriage license, they must receive at least five hours of marriage counseling from a state-licensed social worker. This counseling is designed to assure that applicants for marriage licenses know their legal rights and duties in relation to marriage and parenthood, understand the "true nature" of the marriage relationship, and understand the procedures for obtaining divorces. Pine, aged 25, contemplates marrying Ross, aged 25. Both are residents of the state of Champlain. Pine has not yet proposed to Ross because he is offended by the counseling requirement. Pine sues in federal court seeking a declaratory judgment that the Young Adult Marriage Counseling Act is unconstitutional. Which of the following is the clearest ground for dismissal of this action by the court?
1923	Paul sued Donna for breach of contract. Paul's position was that Joan, whom he understood to be Donna's agent, said: "On behalf of Donna, I accept your offer." Donna asserted that Joan had no actual or apparent authority to accept the offer on Donna's behalf. Paul's testimony concerning Joan's statement is
1924	Defendant is on trial for robbing a bank in State A. She testified that she was in State B at the time of the robbery. Defendant calls her friend, Witness, to testify that two days before the robbery Defendant told him that she was going to spend the next three days in State B. Witness's testimony is
1925	The President of the United States entered into a bilateral agreement with another country regarding the probate of estates. One part of the agreement provided that, should a citizen of that country die owning property in the United States, the executor or administrator appointed in that country should have the power to deal with such property and a separate American administrator or executor need not be appointed. A citizen of that country died, owning property in the United States. His will appointed his brother, a citizen and resident of the country, as executor. A law in the state where his property was located requires that all property left by will within the state be probated by an executor or administrator who is a resident of the state. If the brother desires to act as executor of the estate and properly distribute the property in accordance with the decedent's will, should he be allowed to do so, notwithstanding the state statute?
1926	A seller conveyed her residential city property to a buyer by a general warranty deed. On taking possession of the property, the buyer discovered that the garage of his neighbor encroached six inches onto his property. If the buyer wishes to compel the seller to assist him in a suit against the neighbor, which of the following covenants may he rely on to do so?
1927	At 11:00 p.m., John and Marsha were accosted in the entrance to their apartment building by Dirk, who was armed as well as masked. Dirk ordered the couple to take him into their apartment. After they entered the apartment, Dirk forced Marsha to bind and gag her husband John and then to open a safe which contained a diamond necklace. Dirk then tied her up and fled with the necklace. He was apprehended by apartment building security guards. Before the guards could return to the apartment, but after Dirk was arrested, John, straining to free himself, suffered a massive heart attack and died. Dirk is guilty of
1928	The defendant, in need of money, agreed to give the victim possession of some personal property in exchange for a loan. However, it soon became apparent that the defendant would not be able to repay the loan. Not wanting to lose her property, the defendant asked a friend to go to the victim's home to retrieve the property. The friend, knowing that the property belonged to the defendant, but not knowing of its use as collateral, did so. If the defendant is prosecuted for larceny of the personal property from the victim, the defendant will be found:
1929	The plaintiff entered a hunting area dressed in a deer costume, in hopes of getting deer to come within range of his gun. The defendant, who had consumed numerous alcoholic beverages before embarking on his hunt, caught sight of the deer costume and fired, injuring the plaintiff. The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant to recover for his injuries. The jurisdiction retains traditional contributory negligence. Which of the factors below is not relevant for the plaintiff to prevail?
1930	Dirk broke into Vera's house one night. As he started to stuff silverware into a sack, he was surprised by Vera, who had arrived home earlier than usual. Dirk struck Vera on the head with a candlestick and tied her up. He finished filling his sack and left. The police discovered Vera several hours later and rushed her to the hospital. Dirk was apprehended by the police early the following morning with the loot still in his possession. He was taken to police headquarters, given Miranda warnings, and asked if he wished to make a statement about the prior evening's events. The police did not mention that Vera had been seriously injured and was in the hospital. Dirk said he understood his rights and was willing to talk. He then admitted that he committed the burglary of Vera's house. The following day, Vera died from injuries caused by the blow to her head. If, at Dirk's trial for murder, Dirk moves to prevent introduction of the confession into evidence, his motion should most probably be
1931	A defendant held up a gasoline station. During the robbery, he shot and killed a customer who attempted to apprehend him. The defendant was prosecuted for premeditated murder and convicted. Thereafter, he was indicted for armed robbery of the station. Before the trial, his attorney moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that further proceedings were unconstitutional because of the defendant's prior conviction. The motion to dismiss should be:
1932	Morgan conveyed Greenacre, her one-family residence, to "Perez for life, remainder to Rowan, her heirs and assigns, subject, however, to First Bank's mortgage thereon." There was an unpaid balance on the mortgage of $10,000, which is payable in $1,000 annual installments plus interest at 6 percent on the unpaid balance, with the next payment due on July I. Perez is now occupying Greenacre. The reasonable rental value of the property exceeds the sum necessary to meet all current charges. There is no applicable statute. Under the rules governing contributions between life tenants and remaindermen, how should the burden for payment be allocated?
1933	On Halloween night, a 12-year-old boy dressed up as a bandit by wearing dark clothes and a pair of panty hose over his head and went trick or treating. The boy wanted to impress the homeowners with his costume, so his method of operation was to go up to a house and ring the bell. When the person answered, he pointed a toy gun at the person's face and said, "Your money or your life," and then shouted, "Trick or treat!" At the fifth house he went to, the boy began his routine, but before he could say "trick or treat," the homeowner screamed and slammed the door in the boy's face. Still shaken by the experience, the homeowner suffered a heart attack five minutes later. Is the homeowner likely to recover damages for the boy's conduct?
1934	At Dove's trial for theft, Mr. Wong, called by the prosecutor, testified to the following: 1) that from his apartment window, he saw thieves across the street break the window of a jewelry store, take jewelry, and leave in a car; 2) that Mrs. Wong telephoned the police and relayed to them the license number of the thieves' car as Mr. Wong looked out the window with binoculars and read it to her; 3) that he has no present memory of the number, but that immediately afterward he listened to a playback of the police tape recording giving the license number (which belongs to Dove's car) and verified that she had relayed the number accurately. Playing the tape recording for the jury would be
1935	The police obtained a valid arrest warrant for a drug dealer. A reliable informant told the police that the drug dealer was staying at a friend's house until "the heat was off." Without having obtained a search warrant, the police went to the friend's house, knocked on the door, and asked the friend if the drug dealer was there. The friend replied that the drug dealer had been staying at the house for a few days but had left a few hours ago. The police pushed open the door and began searching for the drug dealer. They found him hiding in a closet along with two five-pound bricks of marijuana. They arrested both the drug dealer and the friend. Before his trial for possession of marijuana, the friend moved to suppress the marijuana found in the closet. Should the court grant the motion to suppress?
1936	The inventor of a laser-beam vegetable chopper ran a television ad that described the chopper and said, "This chopper is yours for only $49.99 if you send your check or money order" to a specified post office box. The owner of a retail specialty shop wrote to the inventor, "What's your best, firm price for two dozen choppers?" The inventor sent a written reply that said in its entirety, "We quote you for prompt acceptance $39.99 per unit." The shop owner subsequently mailed a check to the inventor in the appropriate amount, with a memo enclosed saying, "I accept your offer for 24 choppers." A contract would arise from these communications only if:
1937	A brother and a sister held record title to a home as joint tenants with right of survivorship. The brother moved out of the home shortly after conveying his interest in the home to his friend by quitclaim deed. The friend did not record his deed. Several years later, the sister died, leaving her adopted daughter as her sole heir. Shortly after the sister died, the brother asked his friend to return his deed and give up his interest in the home. The friend agreed and returned the deed, which the brother destroyed. Who has title to the home?
1938	A manufacturer of heavy oak furniture entered into an agreement with a seller of industrial tools to purchase 50 of the seller's Series B saw blades. The agreement required the manufacturer to pay for the blades when he placed the order. The manufacturer gave the seller $5,000 in full payment at the time he placed his order. When the blades arrived the following week, the manufacturer inspected them and found that they were Series A saw blades. He immediately contacted the seller and demanded the return of his payment. The seller refused to accept the return of the blades or to return the manufacturer's payment, claiming that there was no significant difference between the Series B and Series A blades. Which of the following statements is most accurate with regard to the consequences of the manufacturer's paying for the saw blades in advance of inspecting them?
1939	The defendant was prosecuted for bank robbery. At trial, the bank teller was unable to identify the defendant, now bearded, as the bank robber. The prosecutor then showed the teller a group of photographs, and the teller testified that she had previously told the prosecutor that the middle picture (concededly a picture of the defendant before he grew a beard) was a picture of the bank robber. The teller's testimony is:
1940	Able entered into a written contract with Baker to sell Greenacre. The contract was dated June 19 and called for a closing date on the following August 19. There was no other provision in the contract concerning the closing date. The contract contained the following clause: "subject to the purchaser, Baker, obtaining a satisfactory mortgage at the current rate." On the date provided for closing, Baker advised Able that he was unable to close because his mortgage application was still being processed by a bank. Able desired to declare the contract at an end and consulted his attorney in regard to his legal position. Which of the following are relevant in advising Able of his legal position? I. Is time of the essence? II. Parol evidence rule. III. Statute of Frauds. IV. Specific performance.
1941	To help reduce a rising crime rate among teenage boys in a city, a priest decided to organize an overnight jamboree to get teens interested in scouting. The priest met with the city's parks commissioner and requested a permit to camp at a large city park located on the oceanfront. The parks commissioner told the priest that a city ordinance prohibited large organized use of the park during the evening and all overnight camping. The commissioner explained that the city wished to keep the park open for general use during the evening, when most people were off work, and the park was cleaned overnight. The priest brought an action in federal district court, seeking to compel the city to allow overnight camping for this one special occasion. If the court determines that the ordinance is valid, what will be the basis for its decision?
1942	While out drinking with friends one evening, a young man got into an argument with a soldier from the nearby Army base and was bested in a brief exchange of punches. Vowing revenge on the soldier who had beaten him, the young man, after further drinking, went to the Army base and surreptitiously approached what he believed to be the barracks where the soldier slept. As he was climbing through the window he had jimmied, a military police officer happened by and challenged him. In a tussle with the MP, the young man struck the MP with his own baton, killing him. Still extremely intoxicated, the young man abandoned the idea of finding and severely beating the soldier, and staggered home. The jurisdiction's statutes define murder as "the premeditated and intentional killing of another or the killing of another in the commission of robbery, rape, burglary, or arson." The statutory definition of burglary is identical to the common law. The jurisdiction's statutes provide that intoxication is not a defense to a crime unless it negates an element of the offense. At the young man's trial for the murder of the MP, the court should instruct the jury on the issue of the defense of intoxication that:
1943	A high school teacher shot and killed one of the students in his class on the spur of the moment. Psychiatric examinations indicated that the teacher believed that the student was trying to ridicule him in front of other students in the class and that he had to do something to stop him. The examinations also indicated that the teacher did not comprehend that killing was condemned by society when he shot his student. If the teacher pleads not guilty by reason of insanity in a jurisdiction that applies the "M'Naghten test," his best argument would be that:
1944	Del's sporting goods shop was burglarized by an escaped inmate from a nearby prison. The inmate stole a rifle and bullets from a locked cabinet. The burglar alarm at Del's shop did not go off because Del had negligently forgotten to activate the alarm's motion detector. Shortly thereafter, the inmate used the rifle and ammunition stolen from Del in a shooting spree that caused injury to several people, including Paula. If Paula sues Del for the injury she suffered, will Paula prevail?
1945	Plaintiff sued Defendant for personal injuries arising out of an automobile accident. Which of the following would be ERROR?
1946	A witness in a contract case testified on direct examination that four people attended a meeting. When asked to identify them, she gave the names of three, but despite trying, was unable to remember the name of the fourth person. The attorney who called her as a witness seeks to show her his handwritten notes of the part of his pretrial interview with her in which she provided all four names. The trial court is likely to consider the showing of the notes taken as:
1947	Oscar, the owner in fee simple, laid out a subdivision of 325 lots on 150 acres of land. He obtained governmental approval (as required by applicable ordinances) and, between 1968 and 1970, he sold 140 of the lots, inserting in each of the 140 deeds the following provision: "The Grantee, for himself and his heirs, assigns and successors, covenants and agrees that the premises conveyed herein shall have erected thereon one single-family dwelling and that no other structure (other than a detached garage normally incident to a single-family dwelling) shall be erected or maintained; and, further, that no use shall ever be made or permitted to be made than occupancy by a single family for residential purposes only." Because of difficulty encountered in selling the remaining lots for single family use, in January, 1971, Oscar advertised the remaining lots with prom inent emphasis: " These lots are not subject to any restrictions and purchasers will find them adaptable to a wide range of uses." Suppose that Oscar sold 50 lots during 1971 without inserting in the deeds any provisions relating to structures or uses. Doyle purchased one of the 50 lots and proposes to erect a service station and to conduct a retail business for the sale of gasoline, etc. Pringle purchased a lot from Boyer. Boyer had purchased from Oscar in 1968 and the deed had the provision that is quoted in the fact situation. Pringle brings suit to prevent Doyle from erecting the service station and from conducting a retail business. In the litigation between Pringle and Doyle, which of the following constitutes the best defense for Doyle?
1948	The federal government has complete jurisdiction over certain parkland located within the state of Plains. To conserve the wildlife that inhabits that land, the federal government enacts a statute forbidding all hunting of animals in the federal park. That statute also forbids the hunting of animals that have left the federal park and have entered the state of Plains. Hanson has a hunting license from the state of Plains authorizing him to hunt deer anywhere in the state. On land within the state of Plains located adjacent to the federal park, Hanson shoots a deer he knows has recently left the federal land. Hanson is prosecuted for violating the federal hunting law. The strongest ground supporting the constitutionality of the federal law forbidding the hunting of wild animals that wander off federal property is that
1949	As an aide to a member of the Congress of the United States, you are expected to provide an analysis of the constitutionality of proposed legislation that your employer is called to vote on. A bill has been proposed that would create a mandatory price schedule for every motor vehicle sold in the United States. Which of the following should you tell your employer is the strongest constitutional basis for the proposed legislation'?
1950	A bank notified the police that an audit had revealed that one of its tellers had been embezzling money. After a bank officer signed a complaint on behalf of the bank, the police obtained a warrant from a magistrate and arrested the teller named in the complaint. The teller protested, asserting that she had stolen nothing. After the teller had been in jail overnight, the bank discovered that the auditor had named the wrong teller and immediately notified the police. The arrested teller was released with apologies from the police department. The teller sued the city and the police department for false imprisonment. Will the teller prevail against the police?
1951	A city ordinance makes the city building inspector responsible for ensuring that all buildings in that city are kept up to building code standards, and requires the inspector to refer for prosecution all known building code violations. Another ordinance provides that the city building inspector may be discharged for "good cause." The building inspector took a newspaper reporter through a number of rundown buildings in a slum neighborhood. After using various epithets and slurs to describe the occupants of these buildings, the building inspector stated to the reporter: "I do not even try to get these buildings up to code or to have their owners prosecuted for code violations because if these buildings are repaired, the people who live in them will just wreck them again." The reporter published these statements in a story in the local newspaper. The building inspector admitted he made the statements. On the basis of these statements, the city council discharged the building inspector. Is the action of the city council constitutional?
1952	David is being tried in federal court for criminal conspiracy with John to violate federal narcotics law. At trial, the prosecutor calls David's new wife, Wanda, and asks her to testify about a meeting between David and John that she observed before she married David. Which of the following is the most accurate statement of the applicable rule concerning whether Wanda may testify?
1953	A developer owned a large urban property, which she subdivided into 10 lots. The developer conveyed Lot 1 to an architect by a deed that contained a restriction banning commercial use of the property. The developer subsequently conveyed Lots 2 through 7 to six separate purchasers. Each of the deeds to these purchasers also contained the restriction on commercial use. The architect left Lot 1 undeveloped, but the purchasers of Lots 2 through 7 all used their lots for commercial purposes. The developer subsequently conveyed Lot 8 to a florist. The florist's deed contained the restriction banning commercial use of the lot, but he decided that he wished to use Lot 8 commercially. The developer retains ownership of Lots 9 and 10. The florist wants to bring suit to establish his rights to use Lot 8 for commercial purposes. Which of the following best describes the parties the florist should join in his lawsuit?
1954	An owner obtained a loan of $60,000 from a bank in exchange for a promissory note secured by a mortgage on his land, which the bank promptly and properly recorded. A few months later, the owner obtained another loan of $60,000 from a lender, in exchange for a promissory note secured by a mortgage on the land, which the lender promptly and properly recorded. Subsequently, the owner sold the land to a buyer for $150,000 and conveyed a warranty deed. The buyer expressly agreed with the owner to assume both mortgages, with the consent of the bank and the lender. A few years later, the bank loaned the buyer an additional $50,000 in exchange for an increase in the interest rate and principal amount of its mortgage on the land. At that time, the balance on the original loan from the bank was $50,000. Shortly thereafter, the buyer stopped making payments on both mortgages and disappeared. After proper notice to all appropriate parties, the bank instituted a foreclosure action on its mortgage, and purchased the property at the foreclosure sale. At that time the principal balance on the lender's mortgage loan was $50,000. After fees and expenses, the proceeds from the foreclosure sale totaled $80,000. Assuming that the jurisdiction permits deficiency judgments, which of the following statements is most accurate?
1955	While negligently driving his father's uninsured automobile, 25-year-old Arthur crashed into an automobile driven by Betty. Both Arthur and Betty were injured. Charles, Arthur's father, erroneously believing that he was liable because he owned the automobile, said to Betty: "I will see to it that you are reimbursed for any losses you incur as a result of the accident." Charles also called Physician and told him to take care of Betty, and that he, Charles, would pay the bill. Arthur, having no assets, died as a result of his injuries. Dodge, one of Arthur's creditors, wrote to Charles stating that Arthur owed him a clothing bill of $200 and that he was going to file a claim against Arthur's estate. Charles replied: "If you don't file a claim against Arthur's estate, I will pay what he owed you." Assume that Charles, honestly believing that he owed Dodge nothing, refused to pay anything to Dodge, who honestly believed that Charles owed him $200. If Dodge then accepts $150 from Charles in settlement of the claim, will Dodge succeed in an action against Charles for the remaining $50 ?
1956	Harry met Bill, who was known to him to be a burglar, in a bar. Harry told Bill that he needed money. He promised to pay Bill $500 if Bill would go to Harry's house the following night and take some silverware. Harry explained to Bill that, although the silverware was legally his, his wife would object to his selling it. Harry pointed out his home, one of a group of similar tract houses. He drew a floor plan of the house that showed the location of the silverware. Harry said that his wife usually took several sleeping pills before retiring, and that he would make sure that she took them the next night. He promised to leave a window unlocked. Everything went according to the plan except that Bill, deceived by the similarity of the tract houses, went to the wrong house. He found a window unlocked, climbed in and found silver where Harry had indicated. He took the silver to the cocktail lounge where the payoff was to take place. At that point the police arrested the two men. If Harry and Bill are charged with a conspiracy to commit burglary, their best argument for acquittal is that
1957	A buyer purchased a parcel of land from a seller for $500,000. The buyer financed the purchase by obtaining a loan from the seller for $300,000 in exchange for a mortgage on the land. The seller promptly and properly recorded his mortgage. Shortly thereafter, the buyer gave a mortgage on the land to a creditor to satisfy a preexisting debt of $100,000 owed to the creditor. The creditor also promptly and properly recorded its mortgage. Within a year, the buyer stopped making payments on both mortgages, and the seller brought an action to foreclose on his mortgage. The creditor was not included as a party to the foreclosure action. The seller purchased the property at a public foreclosure sale in satisfaction of the loan. The creditor subsequently discovered the sale and informed the seller that it was not valid. Who has title to the land?
1958	The defendant happened to have the same name as a famous attorney in the city. Coincidentally, they also shared the same birthday, and their Social Security numbers nearly matched except for one number. The defendant went to an electronics store to buy a new portable television set, and decided to finance the purchase because he had little money. The defendant truthfully filled out the store's credit application. As had happened previously, the defendant was mistaken for the famous attorney. As a result, he was approved for a credit line well beyond his means. Instead of explaining the situation, the defendant took advantage by purchasing a stateof-the-art high-definition television set with a surround sound system. The defendant knew that he would be unable to make payments on the equipment when due, but he decided to deal with that when the time came. After several months of nonpayments, the defendant received notice that the store was going to repossess the television and sound system. Before it could do so, a fire burned the defendant's home to the ground, destroying all of his property, including the electronics. The electronics store filed a criminal complaint against the defendant, outlining all of the above facts. The authorities will likely determine that:
1959	A state statute provides as follows: Any judgment properly filed shall, for 10 years from the date of filing, be a lien on the real property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person against whom the judgment is rendered. A landowner conveyed a lot in that state to his aunt, who had had a judgment lien recorded against her two years earlier in the county in which the land was located. One year later, the aunt conveyed the property to a buyer by general warranty deed. The deed did not mention the lien, but the buyer was aware of it. Two years later, the buyer conveyed the property to a creditor by special warranty deed. The creditor was not aware of the lien and her deed also made no mention of it. One year after that transaction, the creditor conveyed the property to a developer by general warranty deed. The developer's deed did not mention the lien but the developer was aware of it. The next year, the developer entered into a contract to convey the property to an entrepreneur. The entrepreneur's title search disclosed the judgment lien against the aunt, and the entrepreneur refused to proceed with the transaction because title was not marketable. The developer brought an action against the entrepreneur for specific performance and was denied relief. He then brought an action against the aunt, the buyer, and the creditor for breach of warranty. Assuming that all transactions concerning the property were promptly and properly recorded, and that the party holding the judgment lien has taken no action as of yet to enforce it, which parties, if any, will be liable to the developer?
1960	Pursuant to its power under the Commerce Clause, Congress adopted legislation prohibiting employers from requiring any employee to work more than a 12-hour day. The legislation also provided that any employee whose rights under the legislation were violated by his employer could bring a cause of action for damages against the employer in the federal district court in the district where the employee resided. The legislation defined "employer" to include "all commercial employers, all charities that compensate workers for their time, and all state and local governments." A state required its police department's paramedics to work a 24-hour shift because of the nature of the job. They would then be off for 48 hours. A paramedic for the state's police department was unhappy with this arrangement and preferred to work a regular 10- or 12-hour day. A friend of the paramedic told him about the federal legislation discussed above, and the paramedic immediately brought an action against the state in federal district court. The district court should hold:
1961	Upon graduation from high school, a young man wanted to enroll in a nine-month program at a community college to study to be an electrician, but he could not afford tuition and the costs of being unemployed for that time period. His uncle told him that if he enrolled and participated in the program, he would pay his tuition and living expenses for the time involved, and that he would also pay him a $1,000 bonus for each "A" he earned as a final grade in a class. The young man told his uncle that he would enroll in the program. The next day, the young man's grandfather called and told him that he had learned of the uncle's offer and that if the uncle failed to pay the young man as promised, he (the grandfather) would. The young man attended the program and earned "A's" as final grades in three classes. Shortly thereafter, the uncle died, and the executor of the uncle's estate refused to pay the young man the bonus for each of the three "A's." The young man will not be successful in trying to enforce his grandfather's promise because:
1962	A bartender promised to pay her friend $100 if he would take her color television and stereo from her house, so that she could report the items as being stolen to collect a settlement from the insurance company. Although the friend had visited the bartender's house on two previous occasions, he mistakenly broke into and entered her neighbor's house and took the neighbor's color television and stereo. When he returned to the bar where the bartender was waiting for him, both were arrested by the police. If the bartender and her friend are tried for conspiracy, the court will find them:
1963	A truck driver collided with a motorcyclist in a busy intersection. A police officer present at the scene cited the trucker for running a red light. At the preliminary hearing, the trucker initially pleaded guilty, but he withdrew his plea when the judge told him what she had in mind for a sentence. The judge let the trucker change his plea to not guilty. The trucker, however, had no success at his trial and was convicted. The motorcyclist is now suing the trucker in a civil action for the injuries he sustained in the accident. If the motorcyclist tries to introduce evidence of the trucker's original guilty plea, on proper motion, this evidence will be:
1964	A brother and a sister owned real property as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. The sister executed a mortgage on the property with a bank to secure a loan. Subsequently, but before the indebtedness was paid to the bank, the sister died intestate with her daughter as her only heir at law. The jurisdiction in which the property is located recognizes the title theory of mortgages. In an appropriate action, the court should determine that title to the property is vested:
1965	A Congressional committee was formed to conduct an investigation. The committee subpoenaed a man to appear before it to answer certain questions. The man appeared before the committee but refused to answer any questions. The committee notified the Speaker of the House of the man's refusal to cooperate. The Speaker called a special session of the House. At the special session, a majority of the members of the House voted to order the Attorney General of the United States to prosecute the man pursuant to a federal statute that establishes the penalties for contempt of Congress. Is the Attorney General constitutionally obligated to prosecute the man pursuant to the congressional order?
1966	A housing development contained one-, two-, and three-bedroom units. All units were suitable for occupancy, and the developers of the project filed the appropriate documents, including a Declaration of Restrictions that limited ownership and occupancy of the units to families or to groups of unrelated adults of not more than three in number. Each deed to the individual units also contained the restriction. One of the two-bedroom units was purchased by a woman and her boyfriend. They immediately moved into the unit with another unmarried couple who were friends of theirs. Other unit owners brought suit against the woman and her boyfriend to enjoin the occupancy by the other couple. If the other unit owners prevail, it will be because:
1967	A pet owner left his dog in his yard while he went to work. The dog's constant barking greatly annoyed his neighbor. When the pet owner came home that evening he found the dead body of his beloved dog in the yard, with blood around its nose and mouth. He was very upset because the dog had been his pet for many years. A subsequent investigation revealed that his neighbor had given the dog a treat with rat poison in it during the day because she could not stand the barking. If the pet owner brings an action against the neighbor to recover for his emotional distress, he likely will:
1968	A landlord who owned a strip mall entered into a written five-year lease of one of the units with a discount retail perfumery. The lease provided for a monthly rent of $1,000, payable on or before the first day of each month. The perfumery dutifully paid its rent on time for two years and three months. At that time, with the oral permission of the landlord, the perfumery transferred its interest in the remainder of the lease to a dry cleaner in writing, and added a clause requiring the dry cleaner to get permission from the perfumery for any subsequent assignments. The dry cleaner promptly paid rent to the landlord for 14 months, and then asked the landlord to approve a transfer of its interest in the lease to a video rental store. The landlord gave her oral assent. To obtain the perfumery's approval of the transfer to the video store, the dry cleaner wrote a letter to the perfumery, promising that if any problems arose and anyone tried to go after the perfumery for money. the dry cleaner would "make it good." After the perfumery sent a letter back to the dry cleaner agreeing to the transfer, the dry cleaner executed a written transfer of its interest to the video store. The video store promptly paid rent for three months. Having failed to make any profits, the video store ceased paying any rent to the landlord and cannot be located. The landlord has been unable to find anyone interested in the unit. Given that any judgment against the video store would be worthless, the landlord can collect the unpaid rent owed on the lease from:
1969	As part of a plea agreement, the defendant pleaded guilty at a pretrial hearing to possession of stolen goods, because she knew that the police had recovered the goods and could thereby link her to the crime. Unbeknownst to the defendant, however, the search and seizure of the stolen property was conducted without a warrant, and no exception to the warrant requirement applied. During the negotiation of the plea agreement, the defendant admitted her guilt and provided considerable factual details of the crime, but she was never provided with Miranda warnings before making the statements. At the hearing, the defendant's attorney failed to recognize that the search and seizure was unconstitutional or request a copy of the warrant, and thus failed to advise the defendant that the stolen property could be suppressed. The defendant was convicted and sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement. Can the defendant move to withdraw her guilty plea?
1970	A state provided for a public school system based primarily on property tax revenues from the various districts. School districts that had a property tax base below a certain threshold received supplemental funds from the state that were derived from state lottery revenues. The school districts receiving the supplemental funds served a predominately Hispanic population as compared to the school districts funded only from property tax revenues. To help balance its budget this year, the state legislature passed a statute terminating the supplemental funds program and earmarking the lottery revenues for deficit reduction. A group of parents of Hispanic schoolchildren in one of the school districts formerly receiving supplemental funds filed suit in federal court, alleging that the state's action in terminating the funding violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Which of the following best describes the appropriate standard by which the court should review the constitutionality of the state action?
1971	The State of Aurora requires licenses of persons "who are engaged in the trade of barbering." It will grant such licenses only to those who are graduates of barber schools located in Aurora, who have resided in the state for two years, and who are citizens of the United States. The requirement that candidates for licenses must be citizens is
1972	The owner of a house put the property up for sale. A surgeon entered into negotiations with the owner to purchase the house, and the parties agreed upon a sale price of $200,000. The owner told the surgeon that she would drop a contract in the mail and have her attorney draw up a deed. The owner signed a land sale contract, which included the property's address but did not contain a metes and bounds legal description. She mailed the contract to the surgeon that afternoon, although it was mailed too late for the last mail pickup of the day. The owner's attorney promptly drew up a deed and dropped it in the mail to his client, who did not sign it. The surgeon received the contract the next day. After she mailed the contract, the owner received an offer of $250,000 for her property from her next-door neighbor, who wanted to expand beyond his own property line. The owner called her attorney and told him to inform the surgeon that the deal was off. The attorney sent a letter to the surgeon, stating that his client had found another purchaser for the property, and that all matters regarding the surgeon's offer for the property were rescinded. The owner later received the signed contract from the surgeon. Can the surgeon compel the owner to convey the property to him for $200,000?
1973	When a diner began choking on a piece of shrimp, a waitress rushed to the diner's assistance. Before she could reach the diner, the waitress slipped on some pudding that a busboy had failed to remove from the floor. The waitress fell on top of another restaurant patron, injuring him. If the injured patron sues the waitress for his injuries, can he recover?
1974	A student approached a reputed drug dealer at a pool hall to purchase marijuana, although he knew that it was a crime to possess or smoke marijuana. The student bought a "marijuana cigarette," which was in fact only an ordinary tobacco cigarette, from the drug dealer. As the student left the pool hall, he lit the cigarette, whereupon he was immediately apprehended by a detective who was keeping all of the dealer's visitors under surveillance. After the student was advised of his rights and admitted purchasing the "marijuana cigarette" from the dealer, the police determined that there was no marijuana in the cigarette. If the student is charged with attempt to smoke a marijuana cigarette, the court should rule that:
1975	Chemco designed and built a large tank on its premises for the purpose of storing highly toxic gas. The tank developed a sudden leak and escaping toxic gas drifted into the adjacent premises, where Nyman lived. Nyman inhaled the gas and died as a result. In a suit brought by Nyman's personal representative against Chemco, which of the following must be established if the claim is to prevail? I. The toxic gas that escaped from Chemco's premises was the cause of Nyman's death. II. The tank was built in a defective manner. III. Chemco was negligent in designing the tank.
1976	Congress enacted a statute requiring statesupported institutions of higher education that provide federal student loan funds to their students to fund women's sports according to a complex formula intended to fairly support woman's athletics and remedy past funding discrimination. Under the formula, a particular state military school will be required to allocate 25% of its athletic budget to its female athletics programs even though only 10% of the school population is female. A male student whose athletic program will be discontinued because of the budget allocation filed suit in federal court challenging the federal statute on various constitutional grounds. Is the court likely to find that the statute is constitutional?
1977	In an automobile negligence action by Popkin against Dwyer, Juilliard testified for Popkin. Dwyer later called Watts, who testified that Juilliard's reputation for truthfulness was bad. On cross-examination of Watts, Popkin's counsel asks, "Isn't it a fact that when you bought your new car last year, you made a false affidavit to escape paying the sales tax?" This question is
1978	A generally applicable state statute requires an autopsy by the county coroner in all cases of death that are not obviously of natural causes. The purpose of this law is to ensure the discovery and prosecution of all illegal activity resulting in death. In the 50 years since its enactment, the statute has been consistently enforced. Mr. and Mrs. Long are sincere practicing members of a religion that maintains it is essential for a deceased person's body to be buried promptly and without any invasive procedures, including an autopsy. When the Longs' son died of mysterious causes and an autopsy was scheduled, the Longs filed an action in state court challenging the constitutionality of the state statute, and seeking an injunction prohibiting the county coroner from performing an autopsy on their son's body. In this action, the Longs claimed only that the application of this statute in the circumstances of their son's death would violate their right to the free exercise of religion as guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Assume that no federal statutes are applicable. As applied to the Longs' case, the court should rule that the state's autopsy statute is
1979	A state Yellow plaintiff was travelling to adjoining state Green to visit his relatives. Shortly before crossing the state line, the plaintiff's auto was struck in the rear by a vehicle driven by the defendant, a state Green resident. The plaintiff suffered personal injuries and damage to his vehicle amounting to approximately $90,000. Having managed to obtain proper service on the defendant, the-plaintiff filed suit in Yellow federal court. Under the laws of Yellow, the driver of a vehicle that strikes another vehicle in the rear is presumed to have acted negligently, regardless of the surrounding circumstances. Neither the law of Green nor the federal statutes or case law has adopted such a rule. Regarding the presumption in question, the court should apply:
1980	A contactor agreed to build a plant for a manufacturer. The contract required the contractor to use lighting fixtures from a specific company. Inadvertently, the contractor installed fixtures from a different company. The installed fixtures are generally considered to be of a slightly greater quality than the fixtures specified in the contract. The mistake was not discovered until the manufacturer did a final inspection of the building. As built, the plant is worth $2,000 more than it would be worth had the specified fixtures been used. Because of a downturn in the economy, the manufacturer no longer wants to move into the new plant and refuses to pay the contractor because of the breach regarding the light fixtures. It would cost the contractor $20,000 to replace the fixtures with the ones specified in the contract. If the contractor sues the manufacturer for specific performance, which of the following doctrines will be most important to a court's decision?
1981	Modality City has had a severe traffic problem on its streets. As a result, it enacted an ordinance prohibiting all sales to the public of food or other items by persons selling directly from trucks, cars, or other vehicles located on city streets. The ordinance included an inseverable grandfather provision exempting from its prohibition vendors who, for 20 years or more, have continuously sold food or other items from such vehicles located on the streets of Modality City. Northwind Ice Cream, a retail vendor of ice cream products, qualifies for this exemption and is the only food vendor that does. Yuppee Yogurt is a business similar to Northwind, but Yuppee has been selling to the public directly from trucks located on the streets of Modality City only for the past ten years. Yuppee filed suit in an appropriate federal district court to enjoin enforcement of this ordinance on the ground that it denies Yuppee the equal protection of the laws. In this case, the court will probably rule that the ordinance is
1982	A woman had a history of epileptic seizures which came without warning over the last five years. One day, as she was driving to town, she had a seizure. She lost control of her car and struck a pedestrian who was lawfully crossing the street. The pedestrian died immediately thereafter as a result of his injuries. The woman is charged with involuntary manslaughter in a jurisdiction that follows common law principles. She will most likely be found:
1983	Adam and Bailey. brothers, operated an illicit still. They customarily sold to anyone unless they suspected the person of being a revenue agent or an informant. One day when Adam was at the still alone, he was approached by Mitchell, who asked to buy a gallon of liquor. Mitchell was in fact a revenue officer. After Adam had sold him the liquor, Mitchell revealed his identity. Adam grabbed one of the rifles that the brothers kept handy in case of trouble with the law, and shot and wounded Mitchell. Other officers, hiding nearby, overpowered and arrested Adam. Shortly thereafter, Bailey came on the scene. The officers in hiding had been waiting for him. One of them approached him and asked to buy liquor. Bailey was suspicious and refused to sell. The officers nevertheless arrested him. Adam and Bailey were charged with conspiracy to violate revenue laws, illegal selling of liquor, and battery of the officer. On the charge of battery, which statement concerning Adam and Bailey is true?
1984	Martinez, a widower, owns in fee simple a ranch, Ranchacre. Martinez has one child, Enrique, who is married. Enrique has one child, Ana Maria, who is also married but has no children. In an effort to dispose of Ranchacre to his descendants and to honor a request by Ana Maria that she be skipped in any such disposition, Martinez conveys Ranchacre to his son, Enrique, for life with the remainder to Ana Maria's children in fee simple. What interest, if any, is created in favor of Ana Maria's unborn children at the time of the conveyance?
1985	A city has many parks, as well as a country club with a golf course. While the city's parks are accessible to all without a fee, the city charges a $1,000 application fee and $100 per month dues to belong to the country club. A resident of the city wishes to join the country club but cannot afford the application fee or monthly dues. If the resident brings suit against the city on the ground that the fee and dues discriminate against the poor in violation of the Equal Protection Clause, who likely will prevail?
1986	The defendant and the victim got into a minor verbal altercation, concluding with the defendant lightly shoving the victim. The victim lost his balance and struck his head on the pavement, causing serious bodily injury. The defendant was charged with battery, which is defined in the jurisdiction as "purposely or knowingly causing serious bodily injury to another." Should the defendant be convicted of battery?
1987	Brill saved the life of Ace's wife, Mary, who thereafter changed her will to leave Brill $1,000. However, upon Mary's death she had no property except an undivided interest in real estate held in tenancy by the entirety of Ace. The property had been purchased by Ace from an inheritance. After Mary died, Ace signed and delivered to Brill the following instrument: "In consideration of Brill's saving my wife's life and his agreement to bring no claims against my estate based on her will, I hereby promise to pay Brill $1,000." Upon Ace's death, Brill filed a claim for $1,000. Ace's executor contested the claim on the ground that the instrument was not supported by sufficient consideration. With respect to the recital that Brill had agreed not to file a claim against Ace's estate, what additional fact would most strengthen Brill's claim?
1988	Hoping to help control a growing problem with violent all-male teenage gangs who frequented a youth center, a city council passed an ordinance forbidding any male between the ages of 13 and 19 to enter the center unless accompanied by a female. An 18-year-old boy who was new to the city went to the youth center to try to meet new friends. He was refused admission because he was not escorted by a female. Angered, the boy filed suit in federal district court seeking admission to the center and asking the court to strike down the ordinance as unconstitutional. Which of the following standards should the court use in determining the validity of the ordinance?
1989	A married couple was leaving a nightclub at closing. The wife forgot her jacket and went back in to the club to retrieve it while her husband looked for a cab outside. Her husband saw a cab sitting across the street and ran for it, cutting off one of the club's bouncers who was also looking for a ride home. The bouncer became angry at the husband for "stealing his cab." The cab departed while they were arguing. Seeing no one else around, the bouncer began to punch and kick the husband, causing him severe injury. The wife watched the entire episode from across the street and became greatly distressed. The husband sued the bouncer for his injuries. If the wife also sues the bouncer, alleging intentional infliction of emotional distress, will she recover?
1990	A foreign correspondent wished to purchase a parcel of land from a developer that was not yet on the market. Before he left the country, he gave his attorney $100,000 and his power of attorney. He instructed the attorney that, should the land be put up for sale, she was authorized to: offer up to $100,000 for it, enter into a binding contract to purchase it on the correspondent's behalf, and if he did not return in time, close on the property. In early January, the developer put the land on the market. The attorney offered $75,000 for it, which the developer readily accepted. On January 15, the attorney, on the correspondent's behalf, entered into a written contract to purchase the land for $75,000. Closing was set for February 15. During this time, the attorney heard nothing from the correspondent. When he had not returned by the date of closing, the attorney attended the closing and tendered the $75,000. The developer tendered a deed made out to the correspondent as the grantee. On February 20, news was received that the correspondent had been killed by a stray bullet on January 14. The correspondent's will left his entire estate to his niece. The developer believes the conveyance to the correspondent is invalid, and brings a suit to quiet title to the land. The court will most likely find that the owner of the land is:
1991	A rancher owned a 100-acre tract of land. Eighty acres had been devised to him by his father, and the rancher had acquired title to an adjacent 20 acres from a prospector by adverse possession. The rancher entered into a land sale contract in which he promised to convey the 100 acres to an investor. The contract listed the description of the property and was otherwise definite and certain as to the transaction, but the contract did not state the nature of the title that the rancher was to convey to the investor. At the time of closing, the investor paid the purchase price and accepted the deed conveyed by the rancher. Six months later, the prospector returned to the area and brought a successful action in ejectment against the investor for the 20 acres. The investor now sues the rancher for damages. Which of the following statements would most accurately describe the investor's rights?
1992	The owner of a small dry cleaning business wanted to expand his business to include tailoring jobs. A local sewing machine retailer recommended a certain model of sewing machine for that purpose to the business owner, so the owner purchased the machine from the retailer for the use of one of his employees, an experienced seamstress. The machine had a defect that caused an injury to his employee's fingers, putting her out of work for several weeks. As a result, the business had to turn away all tailoring requests for that time period. The business owner asserted a claim based on strict liability in tort against the retailer of the sewing machine, seeking damages for loss of business because of the injury to his worker. The business owner will probably:
1993	The criminal statutes of the state define manslaughter and murder as they were defined at common law. As to insanity, the state has the following provision: Under the defense of insanity a defendant may be entitled to acquittal if, because of mental illness, the defendant was unable to control his or her actions or to conform his or her conduct to the law. The defendant was put on trial in the state for the murder of his wife and her co-worker. The evidence at trial established that the defendant's wife was having an affair with the co-worker, and that the defendant learned of it and killed the pair. The defendant did not take the stand in his own defense. In his closing statement to the jury, the defendant's attorney made a statement, "Ladies and gentlemen, you must consider that there are some things that would provoke any one of us to kill, and there are things that make one unable to control one's actions." The defendant's attorney requested that the judge give the jury instructions on manslaughter and on insanity, and the judge agreed to do so. The judge also issued the following instructions: INSTRUCTION #6: In order to mitigate an intentional killing to voluntary manslaughter, the burden of proof is on the defendant to establish that adequate provocation existed. INSTRUCTION #8: Insanity is an affirmative defense and the burden of proof is on the defendant to establish that such insanity existed at the time of the killing. The jury found the defendant guilty of murder, and he appealed. He asserts that the jury instructions violated his rights under the federal Constitution. The appeals court should:
1994	A realty company developed a residential development encompassing single-family dwellings, town houses, and high-rise apartments. Included in the deed to each unit was a covenant under which the grantee and the grantee's "heirs and assigns" agreed to purchase electrical power only from a plant that the realty company had constructed within the development. The plant did not supply power outside the development. After constructing and selling half of the units, the realty company sold its interest in the development to an investment firm. The investment firm operated the power plant and constructed and sold the remaining units. Each conveyance from the investment firm contained the same covenant relating to electrical power that the realty company had included in the conveyances it had made. A woman bought a dwelling unit from a man who had purchased it from the realty company. Subsequently, the woman, whose lot was along the boundary of the development, ceased buying electrical power from the investment firm and began purchasing power from a power company that provided such service in the area surrounding the development. The investment firm instituted an appropriate action against the woman to enjoin her from obtaining electrical power from the power company. Both the power company and the investment firm have governmental authorization to provide electrical services to the area. If judgment is for the woman, it most likely will be because:
1995	The owner of a stationary bicycle wrote a letter to her friend offering to sell her stationary bicycle to him for $150. The friend received the letter on January 18. On January 19, he mailed a letterback saying that he was not interested in purchasing the bike because he had just purchased a gym membership. However, the friend changed his mind the next day and mailed a letter to the owner accepting her offer to sell the bicycle and enclosing a certified check for $150. The owner received the friend's rejection letter on January 21 but put it aside without reading it. The next day, she received the friend's acceptance letter, which she opened and read immediately. Do the parties have a contract?
1996	A state bans the use of disposable diapers to reduce the volume of nonbiodegradable material in its landfills. The ban was a boon for diaper services within the state, but many parents of young children were displeased with the use of conventional diapers. With support from retail establishments that lost business from the disposable diaper ban, a grass roots coalition formed to fight the ban funded a study showing that the trucks and cleaning supplies used by diaper services within the state harmed the environment more than disposable diapers. The coalition and retailers then filed suit seeking to have the ban on disposable diapers declared unconstitutional. If the court strikes down the statute, on which of the following constitutional provisions would its decision most likely be based?
1997	In order to get some quick cash to pay off a gambling debt, an acquaintance of the defendant asked him to pretend to break into the acquaintance's home, take some silverware, and return the silverware to the acquaintance. The acquaintance believed that he could both collect the insurance proceeds for the "theft" of the silverware, and sell the silverware on the black market. The acquaintance provided the defendant with his address: "46 Maple Avenue." However, due to a strong windstorm, the house number "9" for "49 Maple Avenue" became detached and slid out of position, making it look like "46 Maple Avenue." Thinking that "49 Maple Avenue" was the acquaintance's home due to the mispositioned house number, the defendant slid open a window that was slightly ajar, entered, and took some silverware he found in the kitchen. The silent burglar alarm alerted the police, who arrived and arrested the defendant a short time later. If the defendant is charged with burglary, the court would find him not guilty because:
1998	The state of Champlain enacts the Young Adult Marriage Counseling Act, which provides that, before any persons less than 30 years of age may be issued a marriage license, they must receive at least five hours of marriage counseling from a state-licensed social worker. This counseling is designed to assure that applicants for marriage licenses know their legal rights and duties in relation to marriage and parenthood, understand the "true nature" of the marriage relationship, and understand the procedures for obtaining divorces. In a case in which the constitutionality of the Young Adult Marriage Counseling Act is in issue, the burden of persuasion will probably be on the
1999	A hardware store ordered 200 cans of wood stain in various shades. The written contract between the store and manufacturer provided that 100 cans of stain would be delivered on April 30, and the remaining 100 cans would be delivered on June 30. Payment would be due at the time of each delivery. The first shipment arrived on April 30. Sales of the stain were brisk, but 25 customers almost immediately returned their stain, complaining that it was not the color indicated on the can. The store owner called the manufacturer and informed it of the problem. The manufacturer truthfully told the owner that they had had a small problem with their labeling machine and a few cans in the store owner's lot must have been mislabeled before they caught the problem. The manufacturer offered to replace all 100 cans from the original order. The store owner refused the offer and told the manufacturer not to deliver the second lot, because he could no longer trust the manufacturer. The owner was very sensitive to the hardware store's good reputation, which he felt was harmed by this incident. If the manufacturer brings a claim of breach regarding the second shipment which was due on June 30, the court will find that:
2000	Pat sustained personal injuries in a three-car collision caused by the concurrent negligence of the three drivers, Pat, Donald, and Drew. In Pat's action for damages against Donald and Drew, the jury apportioned the negligence 30% to Pat, 30% to Donald, and 40% to Drew. Pat's total damages were $100,000. Assume for this question only that the state has retained the common-law rule pertaining to contribution and that the state's comparative negligence statute provides for a system of pure comparative negligence but abolishes joint and several liability. If Pat chooses to execute against Donald alone, she will be entitled to collect at most
2001	A defendant charged with driving while intoxicated pleaded not guilty and insisted on a trial. Right before the trial began, he fired his attorney and decided to defend himself. At one point during opening arguments, the defendant began to act like a cat, meowing and chasing an imaginary squirrel out of the courtroom. If no one else raises the issue of the defendant's competency to stand trial, what is the responsibility of the trial judge here?
2002	A woman decided to run for office as a park district trustee in the next general election. A city ordinance provided that all candidates running for the office of park district trustee must present to the city clerk within 90 days of the election petitions signed by at least 500 qualified voters, a $500 filing fee, and a personal financial statement that will be open to the public for inspection. The woman timely filed the petitions with sufficient signatures, but refused to file the financial statement or pay the filing fee. When the clerk refused to put her name on the ballot, she filed suit, claiming that the filing fee and personal financial statement requirements are unconstitutional. Which of the following statements best describes the likely outcome of the woman's suit?
2003	The city of Newtown adopted an ordinance providing that street demonstrations involving more than 15 persons may not be held in commercial areas during "rush" hours. "Exceptions" may be made to the prohibition "upon 24-hour advance application to and approval by the police department." The ordinance also imposes sanctions on any person "who shall, without provocation, use to or of another, and in his presence, opprobrious words or abusive language tending to cause a breach of the peace." The ordinance has not yet had either judicial or administrative interpretation. Which of the following is the strongest argument for the unconstitutionality of both parts of the ordinance on their face?
2004	As part of legislation enacted for the stated purpose of improving science skills of schoolchildren, Congress appropriated funds to permit public school teachers who had been certified by state school districts as science lab instructors to provide supplemental science instruction to any students in either public or private schools who did not have access to science lab resources. To help insure content neutrality, the statute required the instructors coming to the private schools to use portable science labs supplied by the public school districts, which contained the equipment and experiments that the instructors used for the same purpose in the public schools. A citizens' group filed suit in federal district court to challenge the constitutionality of funding the science teachers for private schools, alleging that most of the private schools covered by the statute were religiously affiliated schools. No members of the group have any children in either public schools or private schools affected by the statute. How is the court likely to rule?
2005	A homeowner purchased a product that makes it easy to remove vinyl tile by chemically breaking down the bonding properties of the adhesive. The label on the product instructed users to allow several hours for the product to be absorbed before attempting removal of the tile and warned not to use the product other than in compliance with the instructions and not to use any other product in conjunction with it. The homeowner believed that she could hasten the absorption process by heating the tile, so she used an industrial strength blow dryer set on high shortly after applying the product. The heat caused toxic fumes to be released by the product, damaging her lungs. The homeowner brought an action against the manufacturer of the product based on strict liability in tort for failure to warn. At trial, the homeowner presented evidence of her use of the product and its manufacture by the manufacturer, the injury she suffered, and that the label bore no warning regarding applying heat to the product. The manufacturer presented evidence that it had received no reports of persons injured by fumes from the product in the 10 years that the product had been on the market. If the manufacturer moves for a summary judgment at the close of all of the evidence, the court should:
2006	The School Board of the city of Rulb issued a rule authorizing public school principals to punish, after a hearing, students who engage in violations of the board's student behavior code. According to the rule, violators of the behavior code may be punished in a variety of ways including being required to sit in designated school confinement rooms during all school hours, with their hands clasped in front of them, for a period of up to 15 school days. Teddy, a fifth grade student in Rulb Elementary School, was charged with placing chewed bubble gum on a classmate's chair, a violation of the student behavior code. He had never violated the code before and was otherwise an attentive and well-behaved student. After a hearing on the charges, Teddy's principal determined that Teddy had violated the behavior code in the manner charged, and ordered Teddy to spend the next 15 school days in the school confinement room with his hands clasped in front of him. Teddy's parents file suit in federal court challenging, solely on constitutional grounds, the principal's action in ordering Teddy to spend the next 15 school days in the school confinement room with his hands clasped in front of him. Which of the following arguments would be most helpful to Teddy's parents in this suit?
2007	Diggers Construction Company was engaged in blasting operations to clear the way for a new road. Diggers had erected adequate barriers and posted adequate warning signs in the vicinity of the blasting. Although Paul read and understood the signs, he entered the area to walk his dog. As a result of the blasting, Paul was hit by a piece of rock and sustained head injuries. The jurisdiction follows the traditional common-law rules governing the defenses of contributory negligence, assumption of risk, and last clear chance. In an action by Paul against Diggers to recover damages for his injuries, Paul will
2008	A landowner's piece of property was located on the corner of a busy intersection. People walking past the intersection often cut across the landowner's property rather than walk along the sidewalk, despite a "keep off" sign that the landowner erected. The landowner had captured a young bobcat several months earlier and had decided to keep him as a pet. In an effort to stop people from cutting across his yard, the landowner erected a large sign that read, "Beware of Bobcat." Knowing that a bobcat attacks using its claws, he took it to a vet to have its claws removed. The vet failed to remove one of the bobcat's claws, but the landowner was not aware of this. The landowner kept the bobcat on a leash in the front yard. The leash was long enough to allow the bobcat access to most of the landowner's property; however, the bobcat could not reach the sidewalk that ran adjacent to the landowner's property. The next day, a woman was walking home from the market. When she came to the intersection, she cut across the landowner's property rather than staying on the sidewalk. The bobcat charged at the woman and slashed her legs severely with its one remaining claw. If the woman brings suit against the landowner for her injuries caused by the bobcat and establishes that she did not see the warning sign, the woman will:
2009	While at a party, the defendant ran into an acquaintance. The acquaintance proceeded to ridicule the defendant about his looks. After an hour of verbal abuse by the acquaintance, the defendant suddenly took a champagne bottle that was on a nearby table and struck the acquaintance over the head, killing him instantly. At his arrest, the defendant told the police that voices inside his head told him to shut the acquaintance up, permanently. The defendant was tried in a jurisdiction that follows the Model Penal Code test for insanity. At trial, the defendant's lawyer introduced psychiatric testimony indicating that the defendant suffered from a mental illness. The defendant most likely will be relieved of criminal responsibility if the defense can prove that:
2010	A defendant was one of a group of persons who were engaged in a demonstration against the discriminatory practices of a private club. During the demonstration, the defendant threw a bomb containing highly toxic gas through the window of the club. At the time he threw the bomb, he knew that the club's president was inside the building. Unbeknownst to the defendant, the club's treasurer was also inside. Each inhaled some gas and were injured, but neither died. The defendant is charged with attempted murder of both the club's president and treasurer. At trial, the defendant testified that the reason he threw the bomb was that he wanted to make sure that nobody would be able to use the club, and that he did not intend to hurt anyone. Presuming that the jury believes the defendant, he can be convicted of the attempted murder of:
2011	A homeowner and a contractor duly executed a contract providing that the contractor was to construct a residence on a specified lot. No date was included in the contract for completion of the home. After the contractor completed 5% of the residence, a tornado demolished the construction but left the lot undamaged. Must the contractor still perform the contract?
2012	A masked magician contracted with a casino to perform magic tricks six nights a week on the casino floor for $2,000 per week. The contract did not contain an assignment provision. One weekend, the magician came down with flu, so he asked his apprentice to perform in his place. The two signed a written assignment agreement that the apprentice would fully take the magician's place under the terms of the contract for the next week. Excited about the opportunity, the apprentice told the casino's manager of the deal, but no one else knew. During that week, the apprentice wore the magician's costume and mask and performed all of the magician's tricks. No one in the casino noticed the difference. When the magician regained his health, he and the apprentice had a falling out and the magician refused to pay the apprentice. The apprentice went to the casino with the assignment agreement and demanded his pay for the prior week's performances. The magician claimed that he was still the one entitled to payment under the contract. Who should the casino pay for the prior week's performances?
2013	A man believed that a woman who was a former roommate had taken a book of his, so he persuaded a mutual friend to help him get it back surreptitiously. He had the friend take the woman out to dinner, leaving her apartment empty so that the man could pick the lock on the woman's front door and take the book back. On seeing the man trying to pick the lock, a neighbor called the police, who found the man still trying to pick the lock when they arrived. The man and the friend were charged with burglary and conspiracy to commit burglary. If the man and the friend are acquitted of the conspiracy charge, the most likely reason would be that:
2014	Vendor owned Greenacre, a tract of land, in fee simple. Vendor entered into a valid written agreement with Purchaser under which Vendor agreed to sell and Purchaser agreed to buy Greenacre by installment purchase. The contract stipulated that Vendor would deliver to Purchaser, upon the payment of the last installment due, "a warranty deed sufficient to convey the fee simple." The contract contained no other provision that could be construed as referring to title. Purchaser entered into possession of Greenacre. After making 10 of the 300 installment payments obligated under the contract, Purchaser discovered that there was outstanding a valid and enforceable mortgage on Greenacre, securing the payment of a debt in the amount of 25% of the purchase price Purchaser had agreed to pay. There was no evidence that Vendor had ever been late in payments due under the mortgage and there was no evidence of any danger of insolvency of Vendor. The value of Greenacre now is four times the amount due on the debt secured by the mortgage. Purchaser quit possession of Greenacre and demanded that Vendor repay the amounts Purchaser had paid under the contract. After Vendor refused the demand, Purchaser brought an appropriate action against Vendor to recover damages for Vendor's alleged breach of the contract. In such action, should damages be awarded to Purchaser?
2015	At a victory party after a hard-fought election, the campaign director consumed several drinks. A campaign worker who had also been drinking took the director to her hotel room for a nightcap. They later had intercourse. The worker filed a complaint with the police, claiming that the director had intercourse with her against her will, and the director was charged with rape. Which of the following is most likely to be admitted in the director's defense?
2016	Driver was driving his car near Owner's house when Owner's child darted into the street in front of Driver's car. As Driver swerved and braked his car to avoid hitting the child, the car skidded up into Owner's driveway and stopped just short of Owner, who was standing in the driveway and had witnessed the entire incident. Owner suffered serious emotional distress from witnessing the danger to his child and to himself. Neither Owner nor his property was physically harmed. If Owner asserts a claim for damages against Driver, will Owner prevail?
2017	As part of a comprehensive federal aid-to-education program, Congress included the following provisions as conditions for state receipt of federal funds: (1) Whenever textbooks are provided to students without charge, they must include no religious instruction and must be made available on the same terms to students in all public and private schools accredited by the state educational authority. (2) Salary supplements can be paid to teachers in public and private schools, up to ten percent of existing salary schedules, where present compensation is less than the average salary for persons of comparable training and experience, provided that no such supplement is paid to any teacher who instructs in religious subjects. (3) Construction grants can be made toward the cost of physical plant at private colleges and universities, provided that no part of the ant is used for buildings in which instruction in religious subJect matters is offered. Federal taxpayer Bates also challenges the construction grants to church-operated private colleges and universities. The most likely result is that the construction grants will be
2018	A large appliance store entered into a written agreement with a television manufacturer for 20 high definition televisions for $300 each. The shipment arrived on time and was paid for with a cashier's check by the appliance store. However, when the appliance store tested the TVs, it found that none of them met the high definition specifications in the contract, even though they functioned fine otherwise. The appliance store notified the manufacturer that it was rejecting the TVs because they were nonconforming, but the manufacturer did not want them returned. The appliance store may recover:
2019	In an action to recover for personal injuries arising out of an automobile accident, Plaintiff calls Bystander to testify. Claiming the privilege against self-incrimination, Bystander refuses to answer a question as to whether she was at the scene of the accident. Plaintiff moves that Bystander be ordered to answer the question. The judge should allow Bystander to remain silent only if
2020	Two farmers owned adjacent tracts of farmland. Both relied on an old gravel road to get their vehicles onto the nearest highway. After many years, one of the farmers decided to develop his property, including a paved access ramp directly from his land to the highway. His development plan, which outlined the proposed public access ramp, was fully approved by all necessary governmental agencies and duly recorded. Meanwhile, the adjacent farmer sold his farm to a corporation. The description used in the deed from the adjacent farmer to the corporation fully referenced the first farmer's development plan and recording data. The corporation now seeks a building permit that would allow it to construct access from the adjacent land to the planned highway access ramp. The farmer objects to the granting of the building permit on the ground that he never granted any rights to the adjacent farmer or the corporation to use the access ramp. The corporation brings an appropriate action to determine its rights to build an access connecting the adjacent land and the access ramp. There are no applicable statutes. The best argument for the corporation in this action is that:
2021	A landowner and his neighbor own adjoining properties. The landowner decided to build an addition on his home. Prior to construction of the addition, surface waters flowed across the neighbor's property to the landowner's property and then to a drainage ditch. After the addition was completed, surface waters no longer flowed to the ditch but accumulated on the neighbor's property. The standing water attracted so many mosquitoes that the neighbor was unable to enjoy her backyard. If the neighbor prevails in a lawsuit against the landowner, it will most likely be because the jurisdiction follows the:
2022	A landowner owned a large tract of mineralrich land in a sparsely populated area. He entered into a lease with a prospector who was interested in developing the land for mining. The term of the lease was two years and gave the prospector an option to buy the property at any time after the first year. The prospector did not record the lease. Six months later, the prospector left the land for a period of time to prospect in Mexico, leaving no goods on the land that would identify him. The landowner then conveyed the property in fee simple to a developer, who had inspected the property while the prospector was in Mexico and was unaware of the prior transaction. The developer did not immediately record her deed. After three months in Mexico, the prospector returned to the land and encountered the developer. A statute in the jurisdiction provides, in part: "No conveyance or mortgage of an interest in land, other than a lease for less than one year, is valid against any subsequent purchaser for value without notice thereof whose conveyance is first recorded." If the developer brings an action to quiet title, how should the court rule?
2023	On May 1, 1987, a car driven by Debra struck Peggy, a pedestrian. On July 1, 1987, with regard to this incident, Debra pleaded guilty to reckless driving (a misdemeanor) and was sentenced to 30 days in jail and a fine of $1,000. She served the sentence and paid the fine. On April 1, 1988, Peggy died as a result of the injuries she suffered in the accident. On March 1, 1991, a grand jury indicted Debra on a charge of manslaughter of Peggy. On May 15, 1991, trial had not begun and Debra filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground of double jeopardy in that her conviction of reckless driving arose out of the same incident, and on the ground that the three-year statute of limitations for manslaughter had run. Debra's motion should be
2024	Storekeeper, the owner of a large hardware store, sells power saws for both personal and commercial use. He often takes old power saws as trade-ins on new ones. The old power saws are then completely disassembled and rebuilt with new bearings by Storekeeper's employees and sold by Storekeeper as "reconditioned saws. " Purchaser, the owner and operator of a cabinetmaking shop, informed Storekeeper that he wanted to buy a reconditioned circular saw for use in his cabinetmaking business. However, the blade that was on the saw he picked out had very coarse teeth for cutting rough lumber. Purchaser told Storekeeper that he wanted a saw blade that would cut plywood. Storekeeper exchanged the coarse blade for a new one with finer teeth that would cut plywood smoothly. The new blade was manufactured by Saw- Blade Company, which uses all available techniques to inspect its products for defects. The reconditioned saw had been manufactured by Power Saw Company. The week after the saw was purchased, Employee, who works for Purchaser in Purchaser's cabinetmaking shop, was injured while using the saw. Employee's arm was severely cut. As a result, the cabinetmaking shop was shut down for a week until a replacement for Employee could be found. If Employee was injured while cutting plywood when the shaft holding the saw blade came loose when a bearing gave way and the shaft and blade flew off the saw, and if Employee asserts a claim based on strict liability in tort against Power Saw Company, Employee will probably
2025	In a property settlement after a divorce, the wife was awarded all personal property that had been accumulated during the marriage, including the husband's classic 19-inch black-and-white TV set. In order to get his prized TV set back, the husband lied to his friend, telling him that the wife took the TV set in violation of the property settlement. The friend remembered that the wife gave the friend's wife a key to her new home, and he volunteered to go with the husband to get the TV back while the wife was at work. The husband and the friend went to the wife's house, but, unbeknownst to them, the wife had taken the day off work. After the friend noisily opened the back door with his wife's key, the wife called the police, who quickly arrived and arrested the husband and the friend. As to a charge of common law conspiracy to commit larceny, the friend should be found:
2026	Congressional hearings determined that the use of mechanical power hammers is very dangerous to the persons using them and to persons in the vicinity of the persons using them. As a result, Congress enacted a statute prohibiting the use of mechanical power hammers on all construction projects in the United States. Subsequently, a study conducted by a private research firm concluded that nails driven by mechanical power hammers have longer-lasting joining power than hand-driven nails. After learning about this study, the city council of the city of Green enacted an amendment to its building safety code requiring the use of mechanical power hammers in the construction of all buildings intended for human habitation. This amendment to the city of Green's building safety code is
2027	During 1976 a series of arsons, one of which damaged the Humongous Store, occurred in the City of Swelter. In early 1977 Swelter's City Council adopted this resolution: The City will pay $10,000 for the arrest and conviction of anyone guilty of any of the 1976 arsons committed here. The foregoing was telecast by the city's sole television station once daily for one week. Subsequently, Humongous, by a written memorandum to Gimlet, a private detective, proposed to pay Gimlet $200 "for each day 's work you actually perform in investigating our fire." Thereafter, in August, 1977, the City Council by resolution repealed its reward offer and caused this resolution to be broadcast once daily for a week over two local radio stations, the local television station having meanwhile ceased operations. In September, 1977, a Humongous employee voluntarily confessed to Gimlet to having committed all of the 1976 arsons. Humongous' president thereupon paid Gimlet at the proposed daily rate for his investigation and suggested that Gimlet also claim the city's reward, of which Gimlet had been previously unaware. Gimlet immediately made the claim. In December, 1977, as a result of Gimlet's investigation, the Humongous employee was convicted of burning the store. The city, which has no immunity to suit, has since refused to pay Gimlet anything, although he swears that he never heard of the city's repealer before claiming its reward. Which of the following best characterizes the relationship between Humongous and Gimlet?
2028	The defendant, while visiting the victim, asked for permission to borrow the victim's car so he could drive to a convenience store to buy cigarettes. In fact, he intended to keep the car and sell it for cash. The victim agreed, and the defendant took the car and drove off. After thinking about it further, the defendant decided that it would be wrong to sell the victim's car, and headed back to the victim's house. On the way back, the car was destroyed in a collision through no fault of the defendant. May the defendant be convicted of larceny?
2029	A builder contracted to build a house for a newly married couple. Terms of the contract provided that the builder would receive the contract price when the building was fully completed. Just when the builder had completed one-half of the structure, a tornado struck the area and demolished the building. What is the builder entitled to recover from the couple under the contract?
2030	A brother and a sister were arrested on the federal charge of tax evasion in connection with the family business. Prior to trial, the prosecutor told the sister that he believed he could get her sentence reduced to probation if she pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and agreed to testify against her brother; the sister reluctantly agreed. During the jury trial, the sister is called by the prosecution. On cross-examination, the defense attorney brings out the fact that the sister was arrested on the same charge. The attorney then asks her whether it is true that after her arrest, the prosecutor told her that if she testifies against her brother her sentence can be reduced to probation. The prosecutor objects. The objection should be:
2031	For this question only, assume the following facts. Buyer unequivocally repudiated the contract on August 1. On August 15, Seller urged Buyer to change her mind and proceed with the scheduled closing on December 1. On October 1, having heard nothing further from Buyer, Seller sold and conveyed his ranch to Rancher without notice to Buyer. On December 1, Buyer attempted to close under the June 1 contract by tendering the full purchase price to Seller. Seller rejected the tender. If Buyer sues Seller for breach of contract, Buyer will probably
2032	In a civil suit by Pine against Decker, Decker called Wall, a chemist, as an expert witness and asked him a number of questions about his education and experience in chemistry. Over Pine's objection that Wall was not shown to be qualified in chemistry, the trial court permitted Wall to testify as to his opinion in response to a hypothetical question. On cross-examination, Pine asked Wall if he had failed two chemistry courses while doing his graduate work. The answer should be
2033	In City of State Y, Maple Street is a local public thoroughfare, designated as a one-way street for northbound traffic. Pine Street is a public thoroughfare, designated is a One-way street for eastbound traffic. Maple and Pine Streets intersect at right angles. The intersection is controlled by traffic lights. There are two sets of lights, one at the northeast corner and one at the northwest corner, for traffic on Maple Street. There are two sets of lights, one at the northeast corner and one at the southeast corner, for traffic on Pine Street. Trucker was making a delivery to a market on the east side of Maple Street, just north of its intersection with Pine Street. There being insufficient space for his truck and enclosed trailer, he parked it with the rear of the trailer extending entirely across the crosswalk on the north side of the intersection. The height of the trailer was such that it entirely obscured the traffic light on the northeast corner from the vie" of traffic moving east on Pine Street. Unknown to Trucker, the traffic light at the southeast corner was not functioning, because a collision seventy-two hours earlier had knocked down the pole from which the light was suspended. Visitor, on his first trip to City, w as driving east on Pine Street. Not seeing any traffic light or pole, he entered the intersection at a time when the light was red for eastbound traffic and green for northbound traffic. Driver, proceeding north on Maple Street and seeing the green light, entered the intersection without looking for any cross traffic and struck Visitor's car. Driver received personal injuries, and Visitor's car was damaged severely as a result of the impact. Statutes of State Y make it a misdemeanor (1) to park a motor vehicle so that any part projects into a crosswalk and (2) to enter an intersection contrary to a traffic signal. If Driver asserts a claim against City, the theory on which he has the best chance of prevailing is that City
2034	Jack and Paul planned to hold up a bank. They drove to the bank in Jack's car. Jack entered while Paul remained as lookout in the car. After a few moments, Paul panicked and drove off. Jack looked over the various tellers, approached one and wispered nervously, "Just hand over the cash. Don't look around, don't make a false move-or it's your life." The teller looked at the fidgeting Jack, laughed, flipped him a dollar bill and said, "Go on, beat it." Flustered, Jack grabbed the dollar and left. Soon after leaving the scene, Paul was stopped by the police for speeding. Noting his nervous condition, the police asked Paul if they might search the car. Paul agreed. The search turned up heroin concealed in the lid of the trunk. Paul's best defense to a charge of robbery would be that
2035	Dann, who was charged with the crime of assaulting Smith, admitted striking Smith but claimed to have acted in self-defense when he was attacked by Smith, who was drunk and belligerent after a football game. Dann offered testimony of Employer, that he had known and employed Dann for twelve years and knew Dann's reputation among the people with whom he lived and worked to be that of a peaceful, law-abiding, nonviolent person. The trial judge should rule this testimony
2036	A couple was engaged and looking for a lot on which to build their first house. They purchased a piece of land, taking title as joint tenants with right of survivorship. Before construction of the house could begin, the man discovered that the woman was having an affair, and the engagement was called off. Wanting to obtain the money to run off with her lover, the woman wanted to sell the land, but the man refused to sell. The woman put the land up for sale anyway, and when a buyer agreed to purchase it, the woman forged the man's signature on the deed conveying the land to the buyer. Who owns the land?
2037	An employee of the state government always received his state paycheck on the latest workday of the month. The employee was not a good money manager, and just barely managed to make it from paycheck to paycheck each month. On the second to the last workday of the month, the employee had $45 in his checking account, and, needing to buy a birthday gift for his sister, he wrote a check to a gift boutique for $100. He knew that he would be receiving his paycheck the next day, so he could deposit the paycheck before the check would be sent to the bank. However, unknown to the employee, the state legislature was having a budget impasse. Because the state constitution prohibited any deficit spending, state employees were not paid as usual. Without a paycheck to deposit, the check written to the gift boutique was returned for insufficient funds. The merchant complained to the police, who arrested the employee and charged him under a statute that prohibited "issuing a check knowing that it is drawn against insufficient funds, with intent to defraud the payee of the check." What should be the outcome of the employee's prosecution?
2038	Swatter, a baseball star, contracted with the Municipal Symphony Orchestra, Inc., to perform for $5,000 at a children's concert as narrator of "Peter and the Wolf." Shortly before the concert, Swatter became embroiled in a highly publicized controversy over whether he had cursed and assaulted a baseball fan. The orchestra canceled the contract out of concern that attendance might be adversely affected by Swatter's appearance. Swatter sued the orchestra for breach of contract. His business agent testified without contradiction that the cancellation had resulted in Swatter's not getting other contracts for performances and endorsements. The trial court instructed the jury, in part, as follows: "If you find for the plaintiff, you may award damages for losses which at the time of contracting could reasonably have been foreseen by the defendant as a probable result of its breach. However, the law does not permit recovery for the loss of prospective profits of a new business caused by breach of contract." On Swatter's appeal from a jury verdict for Swatter, and judgment thereon, awarding damages only for the $5,000 fee promised by the orchestra, the judgment will probably be
2039	Addle, who has been in the painting and contracting business for ten years and has a fine reputation, contracts to paint Boone's barn. Boone's barn is a standard red barn with loft. The contract has no provision regarding assignment. If Addle assigns the contract to Coot, who has comparable experience and reputation, which of the following statements is correct?
2040	On May I Ohner telegraphed Byer, "Will sell you any or all of the lots in Grove subdivision at $5,000 each. Details follow in letter." The letter contained all the necessary details concerning terms of payment, insurance, mortgages, etc., and provided, "This offer remains open until June I." On May 2, after he had received the telegram but before he had received the letter, Byer telegraphed Ohner, " Accept your offer with respect to lot 101." Both parties knew that there were fifty lots in the Grove subdivision and that they were numbered 101 through 150. For this question only, assume that on May 5 Ohner telephoned Byer that he had sold lots 102 through 150 to someone else on May 4 and that Byer thereafter telegraphed Ohner. "Will take the rest of the lots." Assume further that there is no controlling statute. In an action by Byer against Ohner for breach of contract. Byer probably will
2041	A man was tried for the forcible rape of a woman. His defense was that the woman had consented to have intercourse with him. Over his objection, the trial judge charged the jury that while the prosecution must prove the overall case beyond a reasonable doubt, the man had the burden of proving his defense by a preponderance of the evidence. The judge's instructions were:
2042	A couple going through a divorce proceeding was contesting the value of their house. The husband, a realtor, was very familiar with property values in the area and had personally prepared an appraisal shortly before commencement of the divorce proceedings. The appraisal document, which was subsequently destroyed by the husband, stated that the house was worth $200,000. Their next-door neighbor had seen this appraisal document prior to its destruction. During settlement negotiations, the husband maintained that the house was worth $180,000. When negotiations proved to be fruitless, the parties proceeded to trial. At trial, the wife called the neighbor to testify as to the value placed on the house in the appraisal document. The neighbor's only knowledge as to the house's value comes from having read the document. The husband's attorney objects. May the neighbor testify as to the value stated in the appraisal document?
2043	Peter sued Don for breach of contract. The court admitted testimony by Peter that Don and his wife quarreled frequently, a fact of no consequence to the lawsuit. Don seeks to testify in response that he and his wife never quarreled. The court
2044	A defendant is being tried for the murder of a victim, which occurred during the burglary of the victim's house. In its case-in-chief, the prosecution seeks to offer evidence that the defendant, who was arrested several days after the crime, had been caught with several grams of cocaine in his car. This evidence will most likely be:
2045	A brother and a sister owned a parcel of land as joint tenants with right of survivorship. The brother and the sister entered into an installment contract for the sale of the property "as joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common." The buyer promised to pay $50,000 down, to pay $10,000 per year for five years, and then to secure a mortgage and pay the balance of the $150,000 purchase price. The week before the buyer made his final $10,000 payment and closed on the mortgage for the $50,000 balance, the brother died. His will bequeathed his entire estate to his wife. The jurisdiction has no applicable statute on the matter. To whom should the proceeds be distributed, and who must sign the deed conveying the land to the buyer?
2046	A homeowner hired a computer repair technician to fix his computer. The technician discovered that she needed a different type of memory card than she had, so she drove to the local electronics store to get what she needed. On the way back, she stopped at a liquor store to get a bottle of wine for a dinner party she was attending that night. When she was backing out of the parking lot, she negligently knocked over a pedestrian who was walking on the sidewalk adjacent to the parking lot. In a negligence action by the pedestrian against the homeowner, the pedestrian will most likely:
2047	John asked Doris to spend a weekend with him at his apartment and promised her they would get married on the following Monday. Doris agreed and also promised John that she would not tell anyone of their plans. Unknown to Doris, John had no intention of marrying her. After Doris came to his apartment, John told Doris he was going for cigarettes. He called Doris's father and told him that he had his daughter and would kill her if he did not receive $100,000. John was arrested on Sunday afternoon when he went to pick up the $100,000. Doris was still at the apartment and knew nothing of John's attempt to get the money. John is guilty of
2048	A brother and a sister made a written contract pursuant to which the brother promised to convey a specified apartment house to his sister in return for his sister's promise (i) to convey a 100-acre farm to the brother and (ii) to pay the brother $1,000 in cash six months after the exchange of the apartment house and the farm. Which of the following statements concerning the order of performances is least accurate?
2049	Abco developed a new drug, ZB, for treatment of Wegener's disease. Abco extensively tested ZB for several years on animals and human volunteers and had observed no undesirable side effects. The Federal Drug Administration (FDA) then approved ZB for sale as a prescription drug. Five other drug companies, each acting independently, developed drugs identical to ZB. Each of these drugs was also approved by the FDA for sale as a prescription drug. True Blue Drug, a wholesaler, bought identically shaped pills from all six of the manufacturers and sold the pills to drugstores as Wegener's X. This drug had a long-delayed side effect. Sons of male users of Wegener's X are sterile. One such son, Crane, brought an action against Abco for his damages. Abco, through True Blue Drug, supplied about 10 percent of the Wegener's X sold in the state where Crane lived. It is not possible to establish which of the five companies supplied the particular pills that Crane's father took. If Crane asserts a claim against Abco based on strict liability in tort, which of the following will be a decisive question in determining whether Crane will prevail?
2050	In which of the following situations is Defendant's claim of intoxication most likely to result in his being found not guilty?
2051	A state adopted a statute making the ritual slaughter of chickens illegal. The legislative debates made clear that the purpose of the statute was to prevent unnecessary cruelty to animals. The religious leader of a church located within the state, whose core religious beliefs require ritual slaughter of chickens during worship services, brought suit to have the statute declared unconstitutional for violating her right to practice her religion. The court will most likely:
2052	The beneficiaries of a trust filed suit to remove the trustee and recover damages, alleging that the trustee improvidently invested trust funds. At trial, the trustee calls a financial expert to testify in his defense. To qualify the witness as an expert, the trustee asks the witness about her education, training, and experience in finance. The witness testifies that she has received a B.A. and Ph.D. in economics and business finance. On cross-examination concerning qualifications, the beneficiaries' attorney asks, "Isn't it a fact that you flunked out of college at the end of your freshman year?" to which the witness replies, "No." The beneficiaries' attorney then offers the registrar of the college that the witness attended to introduce a transcript of the college's records to show that the witness studied only one year and was awarded no degrees. The trustee objects. Is the transcript admissible?
2053	A pedestrian was walking home when she saw a man waving what looked to be a police badge pursuing another man with a wallet in his hand. The pursuer yelled, "Don't let him get away. I'm a police officer and he just mugged someone!" The pedestrian immediately put out her leg and tripped the man, injuring him. The pursuing police officer arrested the man for the mugging, a felony in the jurisdiction. Subsequent investigation revealed that the man had just picked the victim's pocket, a misdemeanor, rather than mugged him, as the victim had told the officer. If the man sues the pedestrian for battery, the pedestrian will have:
2054	As Paul, a bartender, was removing the restraining wire from a bottle of champagne produced and bottled by Winery, Inc., the plastic stopper suddenly shot out of the bottle. The stopper struck and injured Paul's eye. Paul had opened other bottles of champagne, and occasionally the stoppers had shot out with great force, but Paul had not been injured. Paul has brought an action against Winery, Inc., alleging that the bottle that caused his injury was defective and unreasonably dangerous because its label did not warn that the stopper might suddenly shoot out during opening. The state has merged contributory negligence and unreasonable assumption of risk into a pure comparative fault system that is applied in strict products liability actions. If the jury finds that the bottle was defective and unreasonably dangerous because it lacked a warning, will Paul recover a judgment in his favor?
2055	A statute authorizes a specified federal administrative agency to issue rules governing the distribution of federal grant funds for scientific research. The statute provides that, in issuing those rules, the agency must follow procedures and substantive standards contained in the statute. In a severable provision, the statute also provides that otherwise valid rules issued by the agency under authority delegated to it by this statute may be set aside by a majority vote of a designated standing joint committee of Congress. The provision of this statute relating to the power of the designated standing joint committee of Congress is
2056	Owen held in fee simple Farmdale, a large tract of vacant land. The state wherein Farmdale is situated has a statute which provides, in substance, that unless the conveyance is recorded, every deed orother conveyance of an interest in land is void as to a subsequent purchaser who pays value without notice of such conveyance. The following transactions occurred in the order given. First: Owen conveyed Farmdale, for a fair price, to Allred by general warranty deed. Allred did not immediately record. Second: Owen executed a mortgage to secure repayment of a loan concurrently made to Owen by Leon. Leon had no notice of the prior conveyance to Allred and promptly duly recorded the mortgage. Third: Owen, by general warranty deed, gratuitously conveyed to Niece, who promptly duly recorded this deed. Fourth: Allred duly recorded his deed from Owen. Fifth: Niece, by general warranty deed, conveyed Farmdale to Barrett. Barrett had no actual notice of any of the prior transactions, paid full value, and promptly duly recorded the deed. Asserting that his title was held free of any claim by Barrett, Allred instituted suit against Barrett to quiet title to Farmdale. If Barrett prevails, it will be because
2057	State Y employs the Model Penal Code or American Law Institute test for insanity, and requires the state to prove sanity, when it is in issue, beyond a reasonable doubt. At Askew's trial for murder, he pleaded insanity. The state put on an expert psychiatrist who had examined Askew. He testified that, in his opinion, Askew was sane at the time of the murder. Askew's attorney did not introduce expert testimony on the question of sanity. Rather, he presented lay witnesses who testified that, in their opinion, Askew was insane at the time of the murder. At the end of the trial, each side moves for a directed verdict on the question of sanity. Which of the following correctly describes the judge's situation?
2058	A vintner whose winery building burned down sued a supply company, alleging that two large tanks that he had purchased from the supply company a month earlier had overheated and caused the fire. The supply company's defense is that the fire was caused by the vintner's failure to install modern electrical wiring in the rather old building. At trial, the vintner seeks to establish that the tanks overheated by testifying that, two weeks after the tanks were installed, a supply company employee came to inspect the installation, and the vintner said to him, "You know, sometimes these tanks get awful hot." Should the vintner be permitted to so testify?
2059	Les leased a barn to his neighbor, Tom, for a term of three years. Tom took possession of the barn and used it for his farming purposes. The lease made Les responsible for structural repairs to the barn, unless they were made necessary by actions of Tom. One year later, Les conveyed the barn and its associated land to Lottie "subject to the lease to Tom." Tom paid the next month's rent to Lottie. The next day a portion of an exterior wall of the barn collapsed because of rot in the interior structure of the wall. The wall had appeared to be sound, but a competent engineer, on inspection, would have discovered its condition. Neither Lottie nor Tom had the barn inspected by an engineer. Tom was injured as a result of the collapse of the wall. Les had known that the wall was dangerously weakened by rot and needed immediate repairs, but had not told Tom or Lottie. There is no applicable statute. Tom brought an appropriate action against Les to recover damages for the injuries he sustained. Lottie was not a party. Which of the following is the most appropriate comment concerning the outcome of this action?
2060	The defendant was at a bus station on a stopover between two cities. An officer of the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration noticed that the defendant was tightly clutching a small bag and making numerous phone calls from a public telephone. The officer approached the defendant, identified himself, and began asking the defendant questions about his destination. The defendant agreed to follow the officer into an office for an inspection of his bag. In the office, the officer searched the defendant's bag and found nothing suspicious. He then proceeded to pat down the defendant and found a pouch around the defendant's stomach, which proved to contain cocaine. The defendant was charged with possession of cocaine. If the defendant seeks to have the cocaine excluded from evidence, the court should rule the cocaine:
2061	In a college student's civil suit for personal injuries against her stepfather, arising from acts of sexual abuse allegedly committed by him against her when she was a minor, the student calls as a witness a police officer who will testify that, 11 years ago, the stepfather confessed to the witness that he had committed the acts complained of by the student. Should the trial court admit the police officer's testimony over the stepfather's objection?
2062	An officer was driving in her squad car when she spotted the defendant, whom the officer knew because she had arrested him for an armed robbery in the past. She followed the defendant for awhile and noted that he kept looking nervously over his shoulder at the squad car and that he was carrying a brown paper bag in his hand. Suddenly, the defendant darted into an alley. A few moments later, he emerged from the alley without the paper bag and began running. The officer put on her siren and pursued the defendant. He was quickly apprehended and searched by the officer. She then drove back to the alley to search it. About six feet from the entrance to the alley, the officer found a paper bag that contained a handgun. She copied the gun's serial number before taking the gun back to the police station. The defendant was charged with illegal possession of a handgun and carrying a concealed weapon. At his trial, while the officer is testifying, the prosecution seeks to admit the gun that the officer found into evidence against the defendant. The defense attorney objects on the grounds that the gun lacks proper identification. The objection should be:
2063	A landowner owned a tract known as Section 35. He subdivided Section 35, and sold a lot to a neighbor. The warranty deed that conveyed the property included the following language: COVENANTS Purchaser shall have a privilege to hunt and fish on all lands owned by Seller in Section 35. These covenants shall run with the land. Years later, the landowner sold the remaining land in Section 35 to a builder. Shortly thereafter, the neighbor died, leaving the lot to her granddaughter. The builder posted "no trespassing" signs on his land. The granddaughter brought an action for declaratory judgment against the builder to enforce the granddaughter's ability to hunt and fish on the builder's land. What would be the likely result?
2064	A man with a long history of mental illness was subject to recurrent hallucinations and delusions involving a belief that aliens from another planet were about to attack him. When the man saw a pedestrian walking on the sidewalk in his direction, he pulled a bottle from his shopping bag and hurled it at her, striking her in the head and causing her injury. The pedestrian sued the man for battery. Which of the following, if true, provides the best defense for the man?
2065	In a claim for damages in a personal injury action, a plaintiff's attorney sought to introduce evidence of the plaintiff's testimony made to her boyfriend several days after her accident that "I must have sprained my neck when it happened because it hurts so much." The plaintiff is also planning to offer medical evidence that her neck was sprained. The judge should rule the testimony:
2066	Congress enacted legislation prescribing the specifications for various types of containers that all suppliers of nonprescription drugs were required to use in marketing their products. Congress's power to pass this legislation is derived from:
2067	In order to raise revenue, a city erected billboards on the sides of all government buildings and planned to sell the space for commercial advertising. A city ordinance provided that any advertiser could rent the space, provided that the activity or product advertised was legal and had "nothing to do with religion or politics" because the city sought to "avoid controversy." The owner of a bookstore that specialized in books on all religions and "spiritual" subjects sought to lease a billboard on a city building to place an ad. In addition to selling books, the owner conducted daily reading and study groups in the store on all of the major religions. The proposed ad implored onlookers to come to the bookstore in order to find their own path to God and to attend study groups at the store held at 6 p.m. nightly. The ad was rejected by city officials. If the owner files an appropriate suit against the city in federal district court asserting violation of her First Amendment rights, she is likely to:
2068	When a crowded city bus braked suddenly, the standing passengers were thrown together, and a woman wearing very high-heeled shoes began to stumble. A man who was unacquainted with her kept her from falling by reaching his arm around her waist. If the woman sues the man for battery, will she recover?
2069	A well-regarded paving contractor entered into a written contract with a store owner to pave the parking lot behind his store. The contract contained no provision regarding assignment. A few days after they entered into the contract, the contractor encountered scheduling difficulties and assigned the job to another paving contractor who had a comparable reputation and would do the job for the contract price. With regard to this assignment by the contractor, which of the following statements is true?
2070	A grandfather conveyed a parcel of land "to my granddaughter and her heirs, but should my granddaughter or her successors attempt to convey the property, then to my grandson and his heirs." During his lifetime, the grandson's interest in the property is best described as:
2071	The defendant was on trial for possession of marijuana with intent to deliver. The defendant claimed that she had been set up and testified that she was not the owner of the marijuana. In support of her defense, defense counsel wishes to present testimony from the defendant's longtime neighbor that the defendant has a reputation for being a law-abiding citizen, and that, in his opinion, the defendant would never become involved with drugs. The prosecutor objects to the testimony in its entirety. How should the court proceed?
2072	A standard commercial unit for widgets is one gross, i.e., 144 widgets. A buyer ordered from a seller 50 gross of widgets at $100 per gross, with the widgets to be delivered on or before October 3. On September 15, 50 boxes arrived from the seller. Each box was labeled, "Widgets-one gross." On finding that one of the boxes contains 143 widgets, the buyer can:
2073	In a writing signed by both parties on December 1, Kranc agreed to buy from Schaff a gasoline engine for $1,000, delivery to be made on the following February 1. Through a secretarial error, the writing called for delivery on March 1, but neither party noticed the error until February 1. Before signing the agreement, Kranc and Schaff orally agreed that the contract of sale would be effective only if Kranc should notify Schaff in writing not later than January 2 that Kranc had arranged to resell the engine to a third person. Otherwise, they agreed orally, "There is no deal." On December 15, Kranc entered into a contract with Trimota to resell the engine to Trimota at a profit. For this question only, assume the following facts. Kranc did not give Schaff notice of the resale until January 25, and Schaff received it by mail on January 26. Meantime, the value of the engine had unexpectedly increased about 75% since December 1, and Schaff renounced the agreement. If Kranc sues Schaff on February 2 for breach of contract, which of the following is Schaff's best defense?
2074	A thief was passing by a house under construction when he noticed that the ladder being used by workers on the roof had copper braces supporting the rungs. After making sure that the workers on the roof could not see him, the thief used pliers that he had in his pocket to remove all of the copper braces that he could reach from the ground. A short time later, a worker climbed down the ladder and it collapsed. He fell to the ground and severely injured his back. The thief was apprehended a few hours later trying to sell the copper for scrap. A statute in the jurisdiction makes it a felony for "maliciously causing serious physical injury to another." The thief was charged with malicious injury under the statute and was also charged with larceny. After a jury trial in which the above facts were presented, he was convicted of both charges. If he appeals the conviction for the malicious injury charge on grounds of insufficient evidence, how should the court rule?
2075	Alice entered into a contract with Paul by the terms of which Paul was to paint Alice's office for $1,000 and was required to do all of the work over the following weekend so as to avoid disruption of Alice's business. For this question only, assume the following facts. Paul commenced work on Saturday morning, and had finished half the painting by the time he quit work for the day. That night, without the fault of either party, the office building was destroyed by fire. Which of the following is an accurate statement?
2076	Acting with probable cause, the police arrested a man in connection with the armed robbery of a liquor store. After being given Miranda warnings, the man confessed to the robbery but denied his involvement with several other recent armed robberies of businesses in the area. He was formally charged with the one robbery and put into a cell with a paid informant working undercover for the police. The informant had been instructed to find out what he could about the other robberies but not to ask any questions. The informant began talking about a convenience store robbery in which a bystander was shot and seriously injured by the robber, and he deliberately misstated how it happened. The man, unaware that his cellmate was an informant, interrupted to correct him, bragging that he knew what really happened because he was there, and proceeded to make incriminating statements about the robbery. The man was subsequently charged with armed robbery and attempted murder in the convenience store robbery. At a motion-to-suppress hearing on that charge, if the man's attorney moves to exclude the statements made to the informant, should the motion be granted?
2077	The plaintiff sued the defendant for injuries received in an automobile accident. There was only one neutral eyewitness to the accident, and the lawyers for the plaintiff and the defendant mutually agreed on a time and place to depose the witness. The lawyers and the witness appeared as scheduled, but the court reporter who had been ordered for the occasion failed to show up. Because rearranging the deposition would be time-consuming and difficult, the lawyers decided to go ahead with the deposition. The witness was not required to give oath or affirmation prior to his testimony, but neither lawyer had any reason to believe that the witness had any motivation to lie. During the deposition, the lawyers tape recorded their questions and the witness's responses. Each lawyer received a copy of the tape of the deposition. The witness suffered a heart attack and died two months after the deposition. Shortly thereafter, the case came to trial. Assuming proper notice is given, what evidence of the witness's deposition is admissible at trial?
2078	Dent, while eating in a restaurant, noticed that a departing customer at the next table had left a fivedollar bill as a tip for the waitress. Dent reached over, picked up the five-dollar bill, and put it in his pocket. As he stood up to leave, another customer who had seen him take the money ran over to him and hit him in the face with her umbrella. Enraged, Dent choked the customer to death. Dent is charged with murder. He requests the court to charge the jury that they can find him guilty of voluntary manslaughter rather than murder. Dent's request should be
2079	An athlete lent his swim fins to a friend. The friend promised to return the fins in a week, but two months had passed and, despite many reminders, the friend still failed to return the fins. The athlete went to the friend's house one night to retrieve them. After knocking on his friend's door several times with no response, the athlete tried the door and found it unlocked. He opened the door and entered the house. He looked around for 20 minutes, but he could not locate the swim fins. He concluded that his friend was probably using them and left the house, taking nothing from it and closing the door behind him. If the athlete is later charged and tried for burglary, his best defense to the charge is which of the following?
2080	The defendant broke into a woman's house one night. As he was collecting valuables, he was surprised by the woman. He struck her on the head with a candlestick and tied her up, then finished filling his sack and left. The police discovered the woman several hours later and rushed her to the hospital. The defendant was apprehended by the police early the following morning with the loot still in his possession. He was taken to police headquarters, given Miranda warnings, and asked if he wished to make a statement about the prior evening's events. The police did not mention that the woman had been seriously injured and was in the hospital. The defendant said he understood his rights and was willing to talk. He then admitted that he committed the burglary of the woman's house. The following day, the woman died from injuries caused by the blow to her head. The defendant was charged with murder. If the defendant moves to prevent introduction of the confession into evidence, his motion should most probably be:
2081	Lawyers Abel and Baker are the members of the law partnership of Abel and Baker in a small town that has only one other lawyer in it. Abel and Baker do a substantial amount of personal injury work. Client was severely and permanently injured in an automobile collision when struck by an automobile driven by Motorist. Client employed the Abel and Baker firm to represent her in obtaining damages for her injuries. At the time Client employed Abel and Baker, the statute of limitations had six weeks to run on her claim. The complaint was prepared but not filed. Abel and Baker each thought chat the other would file the complaint. The statute of limitations ran on Client's claim against Motorist. Client has filed suit against Abel and Baker for negligence. That case is on trial with a jury in a court of general jurisdiction. In order to establish a breach of the standard of care owed to her by Abel and Baker, Client
2082	On a public sidewalk adjacent to an open parking lot, the defendant accidentally bumped into a passerby. The passerby responded by trying to punch the defendant but missed. The passerby wound up as if to take another swing, so the defendant grabbed the passerby in a bear hug and wrestled him to the ground. The passerby hit his head on the sidewalk and suffered serious injury. May the defendant be convicted of battery?
2083	Eddie worked as the cashier in a restaurant. One night after the restaurant had closed, Eddie discovered that the amount of cash in the cash register did not match the cash register receipt tapes. He took the cash and the tapes, put them in a bag, gave them to Rita, the manager of the restaurant, and reported the discrepancy. Rita immediately accused him of taking money from the register and threatened to fire him if he did not make up the difference. Rita placed the bag in the office safe. Angered by what he considered to be an unjust accusation, Eddie waited until Rita left the room and then reached into the still open safe, took the bag containing the cash, and left. Eddie is guilty of
2084	Landholder was land-rich by inheritance but money-poor, having suffered severe losses on bad investments, but still owned several thousand acres of unencumbered timberland. He had a large family, and his normal, fixed personal expenses were high. Pressed for cash, he advertised a proposed sale of standing timber on a choice 2,000-acre tract. The only response was an offer by Logger, the owner of a large, integrated construction enterprise, after inspection of the advertised tract. For this question only, assume the following facts. Logger offered a fair price for the timber rights in question, and Landholder accepted the offer. The 2,000-acre tract was an abundant wild-game habitat and had been used for many years, with Landholder's permission, by area hunters. Logger's performance of the timber contract would destroy this habitat. Without legal excuse and over Landholder's strong objection, Logger repudiated the contract before commencing performance. Landholder could not afford to hire a lawyer and take legal action, and made no attempt to assign any cause of action he might have had against Logger. If Logger is sued for breach of the contract by Landholder's next-door neighbor, whose view of a nearby lake is obscured by the standing timber, the neighbor will probably
2085	Metro City operates a cemetery pursuant to a city ordinance. The ordinance requires the operation of the city cemetery to be supported primarily by revenues derived from the sale of cemetery lots to individuals. The ordinance further provides that the purchase of a cemetery lot entitles the owner to perpetual care of the lot, and entitles the owner to erect on the lot, at the owner's expense, a memorial monument or marker of the owner's choice, subject to certain size restrictions. The Metro City ordinance requires the city to maintain the cemetery, including mowing the grass, watering flowers, and plowing snow, and provides for the expenditure of city tax funds for such maintenance if revenues from the sale of cemetery lots are insufficient. Although cemetery lots are sold at full fair market value, which includes the current value of perpetual care, the revenue from the sale of such lots has been insufficient in recent years to maintain the cemetery. As a result, a small amount of city tax funds has also been used for that purpose. A group of Metro City taxpayers brings suit against Metro City challenging the constitutionality of the city ordinance insofar as it permits the owner of a cemetery lot to erect a religious memorial monument or marker on his or her lot. Is this suit likely to be successful?
2086	A trainer of homing pigeons brought several of them to a park that he often used for training. He had trained this group of pigeons carefully and was confident that they would readily find their way home. When they were released, one of the pigeons inexplicably turned in the opposite direction from home. Several blocks away at the other end of the park, it collided with a radio-controlled model airplane that its owner had just purchased and was trying out for the first time. The collision sent the airplane out of control; it dipped low across a highway and was struck and run over by a truck. The airplane owner sued the pigeon trainer for the destruction of his airplane. The parties stipulated to the above facts and the airplane owner presented evidence of his damages. The trainer then moved for a directed verdict. Should it be granted?
2087	The defendant's neighbor owned an authentic major league baseball signed by Babe Ruth. The defendant asked if he could show it to some friends who were visiting. The neighbor agreed as long as he kept it in the display case, which the defendant promised to do. In fact, the defendant intended to use the ball in a pickup game. During the game, the ball was hit over the fence and into a yard with a guard dog, which had chewed up several other balls that had previously landed in the yard. The dog did the same to that ball. When the neighbor learned what happened to the ball, he pressed charges against the defendant. If the defendant is convicted, he will most likely be found guilty of:
2088	A bulk retailer of accessories for musical instruments placed an advertisement in a trade magazine popular with those in the music business, offering for sale 50-count boxes of a particular type of mouthpiece for use with the French horn, minimum purchase 10 boxes, at $100 per box. In response to the advertisement, the owner of a large store that sold brass and woodwind instruments in its shop and over the Internet sent a written order to the bulk retailer for 12 boxes (50-count) of the mouthpiece. In his letter that accompanied the order, the store owner stated that he would send the bulk retailer his payment of $1,200 upon delivery. The letter also said that the mouthpieces must fit onto three specified models of French horn. The day after receiving the written order and letter from the store owner, the bulk retailer shipped 12 boxes (50-count) of the mouthpiece to him. Accompanying the invoice on the boxes was a letter from the bulk retailer stating that the mouthpieces are compatible with two of the models of French horn, but that the retailer makes no warranties as to the compatibility of the mouthpieces with any other model of French horn. Shortly after accepting shipment of the boxes, the store owner realized that the mouthpieces did not fit onto the third model of French horn that it had specified and instituted an action against the bulk retailer. Which of the following statements would offer the strongest support in favor of the store owner's position?
2089	A city council ordinance provided that city officials should automatically issue a parade permit to any group filing the proper papers with city authorities, except in situations where a prior group had already received permission to parade on the same street at the same time on the same day. Another city ordinance prescribed fines for persons conducting a parade in the city without a permit. A religious leader filed appropriate papers with city officials to parade down the main street of the city at 1 p.m. on July 15. City officials noted that they had already issued a parade permit for another parade at the same place, date and time. The officials told the leader that he could not have a parade permit for the time and place requested and suggested that he select another day and/or location. The leader refused and insisted that he would conduct his parade when scheduled, even without a permit. On July 15 at 1 p.m., both organizations assembled on the main street and began to organize into parades. City officials asked the religious leader and his followers to desist, but they refused and were thereafter arrested, convicted, and fined under the city ordinance. If the convicted members seek to have their convictions overturned by the federal courts, they will:
2090	A small village had a population of 400, and 90% of the inhabitants belonged to the same church. The village council consisted of five members, all of whom were members of that church. The council unanimously appropriated $350 to pay a landscaper to mow their church's lawn for a year. An atheist in the village, who lived in a tiny house and paid only $200 per year in village and county property taxes, was incensed that any of it should go to support the church. The atheist filed suit in federal district court to strike down the council's appropriation to mow the church lawn. Should the court entertain the atheist's suit?
2091	Darby was prosecuted for sexually abusing his 13-year-old stepdaughter, Wendy. Wendy testified to Darby's conduct. On cross-examination, defense counsel asks Wendy, "Isn't it true that shortly before you complained that Darby abused you, he punished you for maliciously ruining some of his phonograph records?" The question is
2092	A plaintiff was injured in an automobile accident when her car was hit by a pickup truck driven by the defendant. At trial of her personal injury action, the plaintiff alleges that the defendant was driving on the wrong side of the road in excess of the posted speed limit. The defendant denies these allegations and denies liability for the accident. The plaintiff seeks to introduce evidence that the defendant has a reputation in the community for being a daredevil and for being somewhat irresponsible. In fact, the plaintiff's witness would testify that the defendant is known by all his friends as "the Menace." The proffered testimony is:
2093	Prad entered Drug Store to make some purchases. As he was searching the aisles for various items, he noticed a display card containing automatic pencils. The display card was on a high shelf behind a cashier's counter. Prad saw a sign on the counter that read, "No Admittance, Employees Only." Seeing no clerks in the vicinity to help him, Prad went behind the counter to get a pencil. A clerk then appeared behind the counter and asked whether she could help him. He said he just wanted a pencil and that he could reach the display card himself. The clerk said nothing further. While reaching for the display card, Prad stepped sideways into an open shaft and fell to the basement, ten feet below. The clerk knew of the presence of the open shaft, but assumed incorrectly that Prad had noticed it. Prad sued Drug Store to recover damages for the injuries he sustained in the fall. The jurisdiction has adopted a rule of pure comparative negligence, and it follows traditional common-law rules governing the duties of a land possessor. Will Prad recover a judgment against Drug Store?
2094	Testator, whose nephew Bypast was his only heir, died leaving a will that gave his entire estate to charity. Bypast, knowing full well that Testator was of sound mind all of his life, and having no evidence to the contrary, nevertheless filed a suit contesting Testator's will on the ground that Testator was incompetent when the will was signed. Craven, Testator's executor, offered Bypast $5,000 to settle the suit, and Bypast agreed. If Craven then repudiates the agreement and the foregoing facts are proved or admitted in Bypast's suit against Craven for breach of contract, is Bypast entitled to recover under the prevailing view?
2095	A man offered to sell a piano to a female acquaintance for $400. The woman had been to the man's house and knew that he owned a Steinberg piano, so she accepted. Unbeknownst to the woman, the man also owned a Hairwin piano, and that was the piano that he intended to sell, although he was aware that the woman had only seen the Steinberg. If the woman sues the man to obtain the Steinberg, who will prevail?
2096	The Kernel Corporation, through its president, Demeter Gritz, requested from Vault Finance, Inc., a short-term loan of $100,000. On April 1, Gritz and Vault's loan officer agreed orally that Vault would make the loan on the following terms: (1) the loan would be repaid in full on or before the following July 1 and would carry interest at an annual rate of 15 percent (a lawful rate under the applicable usury law); and (2) Gritz would personally guarantee repayment. The loan was approved and made on April 5. The only document evidencing the loan was a memorandum, written and supplied by Vault and signed by Gritz for Kernel, that read in its entirety: April 5 In consideration of a loan advanced on this date, Kernel Corporation hereby promises to pay Vault Finance, Inc., $100,000 on September 1. Kernel Corporation By /s /Demeter Gritz Demeter Gritz, President Kernel Corporation did not repay the loan on or before July 1, although it had sufficient funds to do so. On July 10, Vault sued Kernel as principal debtor and Gritz individually as guarantor for $100,000, plus 15 percent interest from April 5. At the trial, can Vault prove Gritz's oral promise to guarantee the loan?
2097	An owner and a builder executed a contract providing that the builder was to construct a residence on a specified location according to plans and specifications. The total contract price was $500,000. The lot on which the residence was to be built was located on the seashore and there was an existing wood frame structure that had to be demolished before the residence could be built. No date was included in the contract for completion of the home. The contract between the owner and the builder stated that construction would begin within two weeks after the existing structure was demolished and the rubble removed from the lot. The day after the preexisting structure was demolished and the rubble removed, a hurricane eroded the seashore, resulting in the owner's lot being now under water. The builder will not need to perform the contract because:
2098	A young man borrowed his mother's car to go on a job interview. He was running late and made a left turn directly in front of a taxicab without looking. The cab driver was busy talking on his cell phone and did not see the man until it was too late, so the two cars collided. Had the cab driver been paying proper attention, he could have avoided the accident. The cab's passenger was injured in the accident. The cab's passenger asserted a claim against the young man's mother for personal injuries. The jurisdiction retains the common law rule pertaining to the liability of car owners for the conduct of drivers. The passenger will:
2099	In 1965 Hubert Green executed his will which in pertinent part provided, "I hereby give, devise, and bequeath Greenvale to my surviving widow for life, remainder to such of my children as shall live to attain the age of 30 years, but if any child dies under the age of 30 years survived by a child or children, such child or children shall take and receive the share which his, her, or their parent would have received had such parent lived to attain the age of 30 years." At the date of writing his will, Green was married to Susan, and they had two children, Allan and Beth. Susan died in 1970 and Hubert married Waverly in 1972. At his death in 1980, Green was survived by his wife, Waverly, and three children, Allan, Beth, and Carter. Carter, who was born in 1974, was his child by Waverly. In a jurisdiction which recognizes the common-law Rule Against Perpetuities unmodified by statute, the result of the application of the rule is that the
2100	Plagued by neighborhood youths who had been stealing lawn furniture from his back yard, Armando remained awake nightly watching for them. One evening Armando heard noises in his backyard. He yelled out, warning intruders to leave. Receiving no answer, he fired a shotgun filled with nonlethal buckshot into bushes along his back fence where he believed the intruders might be hiding. A six-year-old child was hiding in the bushes and was struck in the eye by some of the pellets, causing loss of sight. If Armando is charged with second-degree assault, which is defined in the jurisdiction as "maliciously causing serious physical injury to another," he is
2101	Kingsley was prosecuted for selling cocaine to an undercover police agent. At his trial, he testified that he only sold the drugs to the agent, whom Kingsley knew as "Speedy," because Speedy had told him that he (Speedy) would be killed by fellow gang members unless he supplied them with cocaine. The prosecution did not cross-examine Kingsley. As rebuttal evidence, however, the prosecutor introduced records, over Kingsley's objection, showing that Kingsley had two prior convictions for narcotics-related offenses. The court instructed the jury concerning the defense of entrapment and added, also over Kingsley's objection but in accord with state law, that it should acquit on the ground of entrapment only if it found that the defendant had established the elements of the defense by a preponderance of the evidence. Kingsley was convicted. On appeal, Kingsley's conviction should be
2102	After reaching an oral agreement on the terms of representation, a law firm, at its clients' behest, instituted a class action lawsuit against a tobacco company for $100 million. Prior to signing the written contract outlining the parties' rights and responsibilities, including the fee arrangement, the firm's senior partner told the clients' representative in a moment of goodwill and generosity that if they won or the tobacco company settled, he would turn over half of the attorneys' fees in the case to a particular nonprofit group that funds research on lung cancer and other respiratory illnesses. After the law firm won the case and collected its fee of $33 million, it had second thoughts about turning over half of it to the nonprofit group. If the nonprofit group sues the law firm in an attempt to collect the $16.5 million, which of the following is the law firm's best defense to such action?
2103	A gardener purchased a new riding lawnmower from a gardening store. The gardener used the lawnmower that afternoon to mow her lawn. Although the instructions recommended against it, she ran the mower at full throttle around her yard because she was in a hurry to finish. As she was nearing the edge of her property, she attempted to turn the mower. However, the steering wheel locked and she was unable to turn, hitting a low wall on the border of her property. The collision caused the mower to overturn and the gardener was injured. The gardener asserts a claim against the gardening store based on strict liability in tort in a jurisdiction that follows traditional contributory negligence rules. At trial, the gardener presents evidence that the steering locked because of a defect present when the mower left the manufacturer's factory. The gardening store presented evidence that it carefully inspected the mower before selling it. Will the gardener likely prevail?
2104	Congress passed a law forbidding the United States mails to be used for the distribution of unsolicited advertising for contraceptives. This led to litigation in the federal courts regarding the constitutionality of the statute. The best argument against the constitutionality of the statute is that:
2105	The defendant is charged with the criminal battery of the victim, a security guard in a drug store. At the trial, the prosecution introduces evidence that while the victim was attempting to question the defendant about a suspected shoplifting incident, the defendant committed a battery on the victim. The defendant claims selfdefense, and offers into evidence a judgment for damages against the victim for battery against another person under similar circumstances three months earlier. Evidence of the judgment would be:
2106	A defendant is on trial for allegedly burning down her business establishment because it was losing money. Before the defendant takes the stand in her defense, the prosecution seeks to introduce testimony from an insurance agent that the defendant purchased two insurance policies for the building within a month before the fire. Each policy had been purchased from a different insurance carrier and each policy was in the amount of the full value of the business. The defendant's attorney objects to the introduction of this testimony. The court should rule that the testimony is:
2107	Twenty percent of the residents of Green City are members of minority racial groups. These residents are evenly distributed among the many different residential areas of the city. The five city council members of Green City are elected from five single-member electoral districts that are nearly equally populated. No candidate has ever been elected to the city council who was a member of a minority racial group. A group of citizens who are members of minority racial groups file suit in federal district court seeking a declaratory judgment that the single-member districts in Green City are unconstitutional. They claim that the single-member districting system in that city diminishes the ability of voters who are members of minority racial groups to affect the outcome of city elections. They seek an order from the court forcing the city to adopt an at-large election system in which the five candidates with the greatest vote totals would be elected to the city council. No state or federal statutes are applicable to the resolution of this suit. Which of the following constitutional provisions provides the most obvious basis for plaintiffs' claim in this suit?
2108	Ohner and Planner signed a detailed writing in which Planner, a landscape architect, agreed to landscape and replant Ohner's residential property in accordance with a design prepared by Planner and incorporated in the writing. Ohner agreed to pay $10,000 for the work upon its completion. Ohner's spouse was not a party to the agreement, and had no ownership interest in the premises. For this question only, assume the following facts. Shortly before the agreement was signed, Ohner and Planner orally agreed that the writing would not become binding on either party unless Ohner's spouse should approve the landscaping design. If Ohner's spouse disapproves the design and Ohner refuses to allow Planner to proceed with the work, is evidence of the oral agreement admissible in Planner's action against Ohner for breach of contract?
2109	During extensive hearings, a state legislature determined that double tractor-trailer rigs-trucks consisting of a tractor (the motorized portion) towing two large, connected trailers-caused the roadway to deteriorate faster than other freight vehicles and autos because of their weight. Traffic safety experts also produced evidence showing that double tractor-trailer vehicles were involved in more accidents than other freight vehicles, primarily due to "jackknifing," where the rear trailer loses traction and swerves violently, causing the entire vehicle to be upended. Consequently, the legislature passed a statute requiring the owners and users of double tractor-trailer vehicles to pay a user's fee, in addition to normal vehicle licenses, of 10 cents per mile traveled over state highways and an annual registration fee of $5,000. The owner of 30 tractors in a neighboring state that almost exclusively pull double trailer rigs through the state imposing the fees determined that about 30% of the total mileage of all of the owner's vehicles is accumulated in that state, and that there is no easy way to avoid traveling through that state to get to the delivery destinations in other states. The mileage fees and registration fees for 30 trucks in a year would be about 60% of the owner's gross annual income. The owner brought suit in federal district court seeking a judicial declaration that the fees imposed by the state statute are unconstitutional. At trial, attorneys for the state produced evidence of highway destruction and safety hazards from the double tractor-trailer rigs as found by legislative committee hearings. The owner proved the relevant facts about his operations and the cost the statute would impose. If the court finds the tax unconstitutional, it will most likely be because:
2110	A bookie testified before a grand jury regarding allegedly illegal gambling activities. As a result, the bookie was indicted and a warrant was issued for the bookie's arrest, along with a search warrant for the bookie's home. The police went to the bookie's home, informed him of the charges against him, and placed him in handcuffs. The officers then conducted a search of the bookie's home and found a desk calendar, which had possibly incriminating information written on it relating to appointments. They seized the desk calendar and one of the officers asked the bookie what he had to say about their find. The bookie made an incriminating statement in response. Before trial, the prosecutor obtained an exemplar of the bookie's handwriting to compare it with the handwriting on the calendar. If introduced at trial, which of the following would most clearly violate the bookie's Fifth Amendment self-incrimination rights?
2111	A mother died, bequeathing all of her property to a trustee "to pay the income to my husband for life, and to distribute the principal to my son and daughter if they graduate from college. If they do not graduate from college, then the principal shall be distributed to charity." Subsequently, the son and the daughter graduated from college. Upon their graduation from college, the interests of the son and the daughter in the trust principal would be classified as:
2112	The defendant was walking down a street when he realized that a long-lost friend was walking in the opposite direction. The defendant started waving his arms in a desperate attempt to get his friend's attention. The defendant did not notice an old woman, who was walking past him, and negligently struck her with his elbow with sufficient force to cause her to stumble to the pavement. The fall did not, however, cause her any major injury. If the defendant is prosecuted for criminal battery, he will probably be found:
2113	The father of a young child whose life was saved by doctors at a hospital emergency room called the president of the hospital and told her that he will donate $50,000 to the hospital, payable in 90 days, in consideration of the doctors' saving his child's life. The president recognized the father's name as a wealthy philanthropist who had donated generously to other worthy causes, and accepted the offer. The president promptly informed the hospital's board of directors of the father's offer and her acceptance of the offer. The board approved the purchase of a new respirator for $50,000 and authorized the president to enter into a written contract with a medical devices company to make the purchase, which she did. Once the child recovered, the father changed his mind and refused to give the hospital the $50,000. If the hospital sues the father, what would the hospital's best theory be to recover the $50,000?
2114	Terrorists in the foreign country of Ruritania kidnapped the United States ambassador to that country. They threatened to kill her unless the President of the United States secured the release of an identified person who was a citizen of Ruritania and was held in a prison of the state of Aurora in the United States pursuant to a valid conviction by that state. The President responded by entering into an agreement with Ruritania which provided that Ruritania would secure the release of the United States ambassador on a specified date in return for action by the President that would secure the release of the identified person held in the Aurora prison. The President then ordered the governor of Aurora to release the prisoner in question. The governor refused. No federal statutes are applicable. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument for the authority of the President to take action in these circumstances requiring the governor of Aurora to release the Aurora prisoner?
2115	A defendant is on trial for arson of a restaurant. Chemical tests by the fire department indicate that gasoline was used as the igniting agent of the fire. The prosecution calls to the stand a waitress who works at a diner near the burned restaurant. She will testify that on the night of the fire, the defendant came into the diner smelling like gasoline. Should the court admit this testimony over the defendant's objection?
2116	A homeowner wanted to have his yard landscaped. He called a number of commercial establishments that do such work and received a bid for $5,000, a bid for $4,500, and a bid for $4,000. The homeowner entered into a contract with the low bidder to have the yard landscaped for $4,000. Shortly before the low bidder was scheduled to begin work, he called the homeowner and told him that his secretary had made a mistake in adding the figures, and he could not possibly do the work for less than $4,600. If the homeowner sues the low bidder for breach of contract, who will prevail?
2117	According to statute, a candidate for state office may have his name placed on the official election ballot only if he files with the appropriate state official a petition containing a specified number of voter signatures. A candidate failed to get his name placed on the state ballot as an independent candidate for governor because he failed to file a petition with the number of voter signatures required by state statute. In a suit against the appropriate state officials in federal district court, the candidate sought an injunction against the petition signature requirement on the ground that it was unconstitutional. Which of the following, if established, constitutes the strongest argument for the candidate?
2118	A con artist arranged with a local dog walker that he would pay the dog walker to give him a dog owned by a rich client and then the dog walker would tell the owner that the dog ran away. The con artist would later return the dog to the owner, claiming he found the dog injured and had cared for it, and then demand reimbursement for bogus veterinary bills. A week after getting the dog, the con artist contacted the owner. The owner invited the con artist into his home that evening to thank him for returning the dog, but the con artist grew frustrated when the owner refused to pay the bogus vet bills. The con artist impulsively swiped some cash he saw sitting on an end table when the dog's owner was not looking. The con artist is arrested. Based on the value of the dog and the dollar amount of the vet bills, he is charged with misdemeanors for misappropriation of the dog and attempted theft by false pretenses. Of what additional common law crime or crimes could the con artist be charged and convicted?
2119	Gardner's backyard, which is landscaped with expensive flowers and shrubs, is adjacent to a golf course. While Driver was playing golf on the course, a thunderstorm suddenly came up. As Driver was returning to the clubhouse in his golf cart, lightning struck a tree on the course, and the tree began to fall in Driver's direction. In order to avoid being hit by the tree, Driver deliberately steered his cart onto Gardner's property, causing substantial damage to Gardner's expensive plantings. In an action by Gardner against Driver to recover damages for the harm to his plantings, Gardner will
2120	Penn sues Duke's Bar for injuries suffered in an automobile accident caused by Chase, who had been a patron of Duke's Bar. Penn claims that Chase was permitted to drink too much liquor at Duke's Bar before the accident. Penn offers evidence that, after the accident, the manager of Duke's Bar established house rules limiting all customers to two drinks per hour, with a maximum limit of four drinks per night. This evidence is
2121	A jeweler sent a fax to a gold dealer offering to sell the dealer 100 ounces of gold at $900 per ounce. The dealer immediately responded via fax, "What are your terms of shipment?" The jeweler faxed back, "F.O.B. my store." The dealer faxed back, "I accept." Who must pay the freight charge from the shop to the dealer?
2122	The defendant approached a clerk at a local gas station/mini-mart and offered to exchange a pair of sunglasses for some gas. The clerk refused, saying he could only accept cash. The defendant then pulled a knife out of his pocket and told the clerk he wanted a fill up. The clerk, who was quite a bit older than the defendant, gave him some "fatherly advice" that crime does not pay. In response to the advice, the defendant put the knife away. Feeling sorry for the defendant, the clerk then agreed to give him some gas for the sunglasses. The defendant got the gas and then left. The clerk then discovered that the defendant had taken the sunglasses from a display case in the store and clipped the tag off before offering them to the clerk. The defendant was apprehended shortly thereafter. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the defendant's conduct?
2123	After being notified by a doctor that her employment with his office was terminated, a nurse applied for a position with a hospital. In her application, the nurse listed her former employment with the doctor, with the understanding that the doctor might be contacted. The doctor, in response to a telephone inquiry from the hospital, stated that the nurse "lacked professional competence." Although the doctor reasonably believed that to be a fair assessment of the nurse, his adverse rating was based on an episode of malpractice for which he blamed the nurse but which in fact was chargeable to another doctor. Because of the doctor's adverse comment on her qualifications, the nurse was not employed by the hospital. If the nurse asserts a claim based on defamation against the doctor, will the nurse prevail?
2124	A seller contracted to convey her property to a buyer for $75,000. A title search revealed the following: (i) There were 25 years left on a lease of the property, which was recorded. The buyer agreed to take title subject to the lease but was not aware that the lease gave the lessee, his heirs, and assigns an option to purchase the land. (ii) The roof of the garage on the property extended approximately one-half inch across the property line into the airspace of an adjoining neighbor. The garage did not interfere with any current or future use of the adjoining lot. (iii) The home on the property was subject to a $5,000 lien arising from a dispute involving some remodeling work. The seller promised to pay off the lien at closing with the proceeds from the sale. (iv) The property was subject to an easement by necessity in favor of the adjoining neighbor. Last month, the city extended the main road to the neighbor's land, but the neighbor planned to continue to use the easement because it was more convenient. In a jurisdiction that has a standard race-notice recording statute and maintains the common law Rule Against Perpetuities without any modern statutory reformation, which encumbrance renders the seller's title unmarketable?
2125	A boy planned to rob the local currency exchange, but he needed a getaway car and somebody to be a lookout. He asked his sister, who immediately refused and warned him against carrying it out. The boy showed his sister a gun, threatening to shoot her if she did not go along with the plan. The sister consented to help, and the pair left for the currency exchange, with the sister driving. When they arrived, the sister left the car running so that she could get away and contact the police while her brother was inside, but the boy ordered her to go inside with him. During the robbery attempt, the clerk pulled out a gun, and the boy and the clerk shot and killed each other. If the sister is charged with the killing of the store clerk, should the jury find her criminally liable if it accepts the sister's version of the facts?
2126	Betty Bower, an adult, asked Jeff Geetus to lend her $1,000. Geetus replied that he would do so only if Bower's father, Cash, would guarantee the loan. At Bower's request, Cash mailed a signed letter to Geetus: "If you lend $1,000 to my daughter, I will repay it if she doesn't." On September 15, Geetus, having read Cash's letter, lent $1,000 to Bower, which Bower agreed to repay in installments of $100 plus accrued interest on the last day of each month beginning October 31. Cash died on September 16. Later that same day, unaware of Cash's death, Geetus mailed a letter to Cash advising that he had made the $1,000 loan to Bower on September 15. Bower did not pay the installments due on October 31, November 30, or December 31, and has informed Geetus that she will be unable to make repayments in the foreseeable future. For this question only, assume that Bower's entire $1,000 debt is due and that she has failed to repay any part of it. In an action by Geetus against Cash's estate for $1,000 plus accrued interest, which of the following, if any, will serve as (an) effective defense(s) for Cash's estate? I. There was no consideration to support Cash's promise, because he did not receive any benefit. II. Cash died before Geetus accepted his offer. III. Cash died before Geetus notified him that his offer had been accepted.
2127	In response to massive layoffs of employees of automobile assembly plants located in the state of Ames, the legislature of that state enacted a statute which prohibits the parking of automobiles manufactured outside of the United States in any parking lot or parking structure that is owned or operated by the state or any of its instrumentalities. This statute does not apply to parking on public streets. Which of the following is the strongest argument with which to challenge the constitutionality of this statute?
2128	Simmons and Boyd entered into a written contract for the sale and purchase of Wideacre. The contract provided that "Simmons agrees to convey a good and marketable title to Boyd sixty days from the date of this contract' The purchase price was stated as $60,000. At the time set for closing Simmons tendered a deed in the form agreed to in the contract. Boyd's examination of the record prior to the date of closing had disclosed, however, that the owner of record was not Simmons, but Olson. Further investigation by Boyd revealed that, notwithstanding the state of the record, Simmons had been in what Boyd concedes is adverse possession for fifteen years. The period of time to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is ten years. Boyd refuses to pay the purchase price or to take possession "because of the inability of Simmons to transfer a marketable title"' In an appropriate action by Simmons against Boyd for a specific performance, Simmons will
2129	A farmer asked his adjoining neighbor if he could build an irrigation ditch from the neighbor's natural fresh-water spring to his property to provide water for his cattle. Because the spring supplied more than enough water to meet the neighbor's needs, she agreed, provided that the farmer construct the ditch in such a manner that it would need the least maintenance possible so that he did not need to continually enter her land. The farmer constructed a concrete irrigation ditch from the spring to the land at a cost of $25,000. The only maintenance required on the ditch was a semiannual cleaning. Three years later, the neighbor informed the farmer that her water needs had increased, and he could no longer take water from the spring. In addition, the neighbor did not allow the farmer onto her land to do the semiannual cleaning, resulting in the blocking of the ditch. The farmer wishes to keep water flowing through the irrigation ditch to his land. Which of the following would be the farmer's strongest argument?
2130	A woman purchased a tract of land from a man by warranty deed. Unbeknownst to the woman, the man was not the actual owner of the tract. The woman built a home on the tract and moved into it. Two years later, the actual owner learned of the man's transaction with the woman and prevented the woman from entering the tract from that point forward. This led to a costly court battle. When the woman notified the man and told him that she thought it was his duty to straighten this out, he ignored her. The woman would succeed in a suit for damages against the man for breach of which of the following covenants of title?
2131	In an effort to relieve serious and persistent unemployment in the industrialized state of Onondaga, its legislature enacted a statute requiring every business with annual sales in Onondaga of over one million dollars to purchase goods and/or services In Onondaga equal in value to at least half of the annual sales in Onondaga of the business. Which of the following constitutional provisions is the strongest basis on which to attack this statute?
2132	Able, an attorney, sued Clinton, a client, for his fee, based on an agreed hourly rate. Clinton subpoenaed the attorney's time records for the days on which he purported to have worked for Clinton, in order to show that Able had billed an impossible number of hours to Clinton and others on those days. Clinton's subpoena provided that any information concerning the matters handled for other clients be deleted or masked. Able moved to quash the subpoena on the ground of attorneyclient privilege. The subpoena should be
2133	A photographer borrowed $100,000 from a bank, secured by a mortgage on his home, to build a studio and darkroom in the home. The bank properly recorded the mortgage. After completing this project, the photographer decided to remodel his kitchen and borrowed $25,000 from a lending company, also securing the loan with a mortgage on his home. The lending company did not record its mortgage. After the remodeling was complete, the photographer borrowed $15,000 from an investor, secured by a mortgage on his home, to redo his in-ground pool. Learning of this transaction, the lending company raced to the recording office and recorded its mortgage. The next day, the investor recorded its mortgage. A few months later, the photographer defaulted on all three mortgages, having not made any principal payments. The lending company brought a foreclosure action, joining the investor in the proceeding. The foreclosure sale resulted in $150,000 in proceeds after all expenses and fees were paid. A statute of the jurisdiction in which the photographer's home is located provides: "Any conveyance of an interest in land shall not be valid against any subsequent purchaser for value, without notice thereof, unless the conveyance is recorded." Which of the following statements is true?
2134	The seller of a three-year-old house showed it to the niece of a potential buyer. The niece told the seller that her aunt was looking for extra space to store some valuable antiques and asked whether the large detached garage would be safe. The seller stated that all of the garage's lumber and wallboard had been treated with a flame retardant that made the garage almost impervious to an accidental fire. At the time he said this, the seller had no knowledge of whether the materials used for the garage had been treated with anything; in fact, they had not. The niece told her aunt that the garage was extremely fire resistant, so the aunt decided to purchase the house and moved all of her antiques into the garage. Three months later, the garage caught fire and burned to the ground. In an action by the aunt against the seller to recover for the loss of her antiques, will she prevail?
2135	A recently enacted state law forbids aliens from owning more than 100 acres of land within the state and directs the state attorney general to bring an action of ejectment whenever an alien owns such land. Zane, a resident alien, located and purchased 200 acres of land in the state after passage of that law. He brings an action in federal court to enjoin the state attorney general from enforcing the statute against him. The defendant moves to dismiss the complaint. The strongest argument for Zane is that
2136	A state college instructor was discharged because of her refusal to comply with a state statute requiring public employees to swear or affirm that they will (i) "uphold and defend" the state and federal constitutions, and (ii) "oppose the overthrow" of the state or federal governments "by force, violence, or by any improper method." The statute had previously been held constitutional by the state supreme court. The instructor filed a complaint in federal district court, alleging the unconstitutionality of the statute and seeking an injunction and damages. Which of the following is the state's strongest argument for sustaining the validity of the statute?
2137	A landowner was estranged from his son and three small grandchildren. The landowner owned a valuable piece of property that he wanted to pass on to his grandchildren, without his son's involvement. The landowner conveyed the property to his own sister, "for life, remainder to all of my grandchildren who ever attain the age of 25." The grandchildren's interest can best be described as:
2138	A developer subdivided his rural parcel of land into 10 lots and rented them out to tenants. To supply the domestic needs of all 10 homes, the developer drilled a well on the land. The well provided an adequate water supply and none of the tenants ever had reason to complain of water shortages. Subsequently, the owner of property adjacent to the developer built a home on her property, drilling a well to supply her water needs. Although all of the owner's water usage was domestic, she drew a large quantity of water from her well. Six months later, the well on the developer's land ceased producing enough water to adequately supply his tenants. Both wells draw percolating water. The jurisdiction applies the reasonable use doctrine in determining rights to underground water. If the developer sues the owner, asking that the court enjoin her from interfering with the developer's supply, what is the court likely to order the owner to do?
2139	Walker, a pedestrian, started north across the street in a clearly marked north-south crosswalk with the green traffic light in her favor. Walker was in a hurry, and so before reaching the north curb of the street, she cut to her left diagonally across the street to the east-west crosswalk and started across it. Just after reaching the east-west crosswalk, the traffic light turned green in her favor. She proceeded about five steps farther across the street to the west in the crosswalk when she was struck by a car approaching from her right that she thought would stop, but did not. The car driven by Driver, 81 years of age, who failed to stop his car after seeing that the traffic light was red against him. Walker had a bone disease, resulting in very brittle bones, that is prevalent in only 0.02 percent of the population. As a result of the impact Walker suffered a broken leg and the destruction of her family heirloom, a Picasso original painting that she was taking to her bank for safe-keeping. The painting had been purchased by Walker's grandmother for $750 but was valued at $500,000 at the time of the accident. Walker has filed suit against Driver. Driver's attorney has alleged that Walker violated a state statute requiring that pedestrians stay in the crosswalks, and that if Walker had not violated the statute she would have had to walk 25 feet more to reach the impact point and therefore would not have been at a place where she could have been hit by Driver. Walker's attorney ascertains that there is a statute as alleged by Driver, that his measurements are correct, that there is a state statute requiring observance of traffic lights, and that Driver's license expired two years prior to the collision. The failure of Driver to have a valid driver's license has which of the following effects?
2140	A driller owned a large tract of land on which she began to drill for oil, but all of her exploratory wells were nonproductive "dry holes." The driller was certain that there was oil in the area, and she asked the neighboring landowner to grant her a lease to drill on his land. The landowner turned down the driller's offer. After the landowner's refusal, the driller drilled an exploratory well on her property. However, the driller drilled the well on a slanted angle, so that she was actually drilling under the landowner's land, even though her rig was located on her property: The driller struck oil, but shortly thereafter the landowner discovered that the oil was coming from underneath his land. Does the landowner have an action for damages against the driller?
2141	Police received information from an undercover police officer that she had just seen two men (whom she described) in a red pickup truck selling marijuana to schoolchildren near the city's largest high school. A few minutes later, two police officers saw a pickup truck fitting the description a half block from the high school. The driver of the truck matched the description of one of the men described by the undercover officer. The only passenger was a young woman who was in the back of the truck. The police saw her get out and stand at a nearby bus stop. They stopped the truck and searched the driver. In the pocket of the driver's jacket, the police found a small bottle of pills that they recognized as narcotics. They then broke open a locked toolbox attached to the flatbed of the truck and found a small sealed envelope inside. They opened it and found marijuana. They also found a quantity of cocaine in the glove compartment. After completing their search of the driver and the truck, the police went over to the young woman and searched her purse. In her purse, they found a small quantity of heroin. Both the driver and the young woman were arrested and charged with unlawful possession of narcotics. If the young woman moves to suppress the use as evidence of the heroin, the court should
2142	Johnson and Tenfliel owned Brownacre as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. Johnson executed a mortgage on Brownacre to Lowden in order to secure a loan. Subsequently, but before the indebtedness was paid to Lowden, Johnson died intestate with Stokes as her only heir at law. The jurisdiction in which Brownacre is located recognizes the title theory of mortgages. In an appropriate action, the court should determine that title to Brownacre is vested.
2143	Owen contracted to sell Vacantacre to Perry. The written contract required Owen to provide evidence of marketable title of record, specified a closing date, stated that "time is of the essence," and provided that at closing, Owen would convey by warranty deed. Perry paid Owen $2,000 earnest money toward the $40,000 purchase price. The title evidence showed that an undivided one-eighth interest in Vacantacre was owned by Alice. Perry immediately objected to title and said he would not close on Owen's title. Owen responded, accurately, that Alice was his daughter who would be trekking in Nepal until two weeks after the specified closing date. He said that she would gladly deed her interest upon her return, and that meanwhile his deed warranting title to all of Vacantacre would fully protect Perry. Owen duly tendered his deed but Perry refused to close. Perry brought an appropriate action to recover the $2,000 earnest money promptly after the specified closing date. Owen counterclaimed for specific performance, tendering a deed from himself and Alice, who had by then returned. The court will hold for
2144	Due to complaints about the "secondary effects" of adult book stores, such as increases in petty crimes, a city council passed an ordinance banning the operation of adult-oriented businesses in any "residential" or "commercial" zone of the city. Such businesses were allowed to operate only in areas zoned "industrial. The owner of a profitable adult bookstore and video-rental operation located in a commercially zoned area of the city filed suit in federal court to prevent enforcement of the statute against him and others in adult-oriented businesses, claiming violation of his free speech rights. The court's ruling is likely to favor:
2145	A woman owed her auto mechanic $2,000. The debt remained unpaid until any claim for its repayment became barred by the statute of limitations. The woman then agreed in writing to pay the mechanic $1,500, but failed to pay him. If the mechanic sues the woman for the $1,500, will the court rule in his favor?
2146	After months of bilateral talks, the President entered into a treaty with a foreign nation previously designated by the President as a terrorist state. Under the treaty, the foreign nation agreed to curtail its nuclear testing program and the United States agreed to lift trading sanctions against the foreign country. The treaty was approved by a vote of more than two-thirds of the Senate. Subsequently, it was revealed that the government of the foreign nation had been sponsoring the copying and black market trade of products patented in the United States and protected by international law. Outraged, Congress approved a bill purporting to repeal the treaty. When the bill was presented to the President, he vetoed it, citing national security interests. Both houses of Congress then repassed the bill by a more than two-thirds vote. As a result of the foregoing, which of the following statements is correct?
2147	A police officer spent several hours using binoculars to observe an older man loitering on a college campus. The man, who was shabbily dressed and carrying a backpack, would approach certain students as they walked by him, and after a brief conversation with them, discreetly pass the students a small envelope in exchange for cash. The officer stopped the man under suspicion that he was dealing drugs. The man was not dealing drugs, but instead had been soliciting donations for a radical political group. The man grew irate when the officer opened one of the envelopes in question and discovered that they only contained literature about the group. The officer then frisked the man and discovered an illegal weapon taped to his leg. The officer immediately arrested the man. Which of the following best describes the situation?
2148	A seller entered into a written contract to sell a tract of land to a buyer. The buyer was to pay $1,500 per month for five years, at which time the seller would deliver a warranty deed. The contract was silent as to the quality of title to be conveyed. After making 12 payments, the buyer discovered that a neighbor had an easement of way over the land, which was not discussed at the time the seller and buyer entered into the contract. The neighbor had not used the easement over the previous year because she had been out of the country. On the basis of the easement, the buyer wishes to cancel the contract. Which party is more likely to prevail?
2149	The President of the United States accepted an invitation to give a commencement address at a small, Midwestern university in its auditorium. Pursuant to school rules, no one is permitted to bring posters, banners, or signs of any kind larger than the size of a piece of notebook paper into any event at the auditorium. The main purpose of the rule is to prevent obstruction of the view within the auditorium. Nevertheless, at the commencement ceremony, a student in a front row balcony seat unfurled a banner that he had hidden in his coat with a message supporting the President. The student was promptly arrested and charged in municipal court with trespassing. The student filed suit in federal court to enjoin the municipal prosecution and to have the trespass ordinance declared unconstitutional as applied to him. Will the federal court likely hear the student's case?
2150	Ortega owned Blackacre in fee simple and by his will specifically devised Blackacre as follows: "To my daughter, Eugenia, her heirs and assigns, but if Eugenia dies survived by a husband and a child or children, then to Eugenia's husband during his lifetime with remainder to Eugenia's children, their heirs and assigns. Specifically provided, however, that if Eugenia dies survived by a husband and no child, Blackacre is specifically devised to my nephew, Luis, his heirs and assigns." While Ortega's will was in probate, Luis quitclaimed all interest in Blackacre to Eugenia's husband, Jos&. Three years later, Eugenia died, survived by Jos& but no children. Eugenia left a will devising her interest in Blackacre to Jos&. The only applicable statute provides that any interest in land is freely alienable. Luis instituted an appropriate action against Jos& to establish title to Blackacre. Judgment should be for
2151	An amusement park entered into a contract with an engineering firm to construct a new roller coaster for the park. The contract provided that the amusement park would make monthly payments to the engineering firm and that the engineering firm would submit a monthly report from an independent safety inspector that all state-mandated safety guidelines were being met during construction. Construction began and the amusement park made three monthly payments, but the engineering firm failed to provide any monthly safety reports. The amusement park did not object. Construction was then halted for two months during hurricane season, and the amusement park made no payments during that period. The engineering firm did not object. On the day construction was set to resume, the engineering firm demanded a monthly payment. The amusement park refused on the grounds that no progress on the project had been made in two months and no safety reports had been submitted. The engineering firm thereupon abandoned work and repudiated the agreement. What was the probable legal effect of (i) the engineering firm's failure to object to the amusement park's failure to make payments during the hurricane season and (ii) the amusement park's making three monthly payments without requiring submission of a safety report?
2152	A homeowner born on the fourth of July celebrated his birthday in his backyard with an assortment of fireworks and skyrockets, despite a severe drought and watering ban that left the grass extremely dry. One of the fireworks landed in a pile of dry grass clippings behind his garage, but the homeowner neglected to check whether it was extinguished. The grass clippings ignited, and the fire eventually spread to the rear wall of the garage. By the time the homeowner discovered the fire and called the fire department, the flames were reaching as high as the vacant apartment on the second floor of the garage. The first firefighter to arrive rushed with a hose to the back of the garage. As he went up the outside stairs leading to the back door of the apartment, one of the steps broke, causing him to fall to the ground and break his leg. Unbeknownst to the homeowner, the wood on the underside of the step had rotted away. In a suit by the firefighter against the homeowner, the firefighter will:
2153	A wife discovered that her husband was having an affair with his assistant and decided to seek revenge. One night, the wife drove to the assistant's house, drove onto her lawn, and began blowing her horn and yelling obscenities out her window. The wife was so loud that the assistant's family and all of her neighbors were awakened and heard the wife's accusations. If the assistant asserts a claim based on intentional infliction of emotional distress against the wife, will the assistant prevail?
2154	Several years ago, a lender lent a borrower $1,000, and the parties agreed in writing that the borrower would repay the lender within one year. The borrower failed to repay the lender, but the lender took no action prior to the expiration of the five-year statute of limitations on suits for debt. Some time after that, the lender phoned the borrower and told him, "If you'll pay me $600 now, I'll forget all about that unpaid $1,000 debt." The borrower agreed orally and then sent the lender a signed letter, which stated, "I, the borrower, agree to pay the lender $600." The borrower never paid the lender the $600 and the lender sued the borrower shortly thereafter. The lender is entitled to recover:
2155	A construction company that was putting in a swimming pool for a homeowner left a couple of large pieces of equipment in the backyard overnight. The equipment was not owned by the construction company but was leased from an equipment company, which was responsible for its repair and maintenance. After the workers had left, a seven-year-old boy came onto the homeowner's property to play. The homeowner was aware that the boy often came onto his property to play with his dog. The boy climbed up on one of the pieces of equipment and began pushing buttons and moving levers. The engine started and the equipment began to move because the equipment company had not replaced a defective safety locking device on the ignition. The boy became frightened and jumped off, falling into the hole that had been dug that day, and was injured. The boy's parents brought suit against the homeowner and the construction company. If the construction company is held liable for the boy's injuries, the construction company could:
2156	Maple City has an ordinance that prohibits the location of "adult theaters and bookstores" (theaters and bookstores presenting sexually explicit performances or materials) in residential or commercial zones within the city. The ordinance was intended to protect surrounding property from the likely adverse secondary effects of such establishments. "Adult theaters and bookstores" are freely permitted in the areas of the city zoned industrial, where those adverse secondary effects are not as likely. Storekeeper is denied a zoning permit to open an adult theater and bookstore in a building owned by him in an area zoned commercial. As a result, Storekeeper brings suit in an appropriate court challenging the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance. Which of the following statements regarding the constitutionality of this Maple City ordinance is most accurate?
2157	A defendant was visiting with his girlfriend in his apartment when a visitor came to see him. The defendant and the visitor engaged in a conversation relating to the distribution of illegal narcotics in the girlfriend's presence. Two months later, the defendant and his girlfriend married. Subsequent to the marriage, the defendant was arrested and charged under federal law with the sale and distribution of drugs. The prosecutor wants the defendant's wife to testify about the conversation between the defendant and the visitor, but the defendant forbids it. May she so testify?
2158	A homeowner is suing a motorcyclist, alleging that the motorcyclist destroyed her rose garden by riding his motorcycle through her yard. The homeowner seeks to introduce in evidence a photograph of her garden to depict the nature and extent of the damage done. The photograph was taken by an insurance adjuster, who was not called as a witness, four days after the alleged incident. The judge should rule the photograph:
2159	When Parents were told that their child, Son, should repeat second grade, they sought to have him evaluated by a psychologist. The psychologist, who charged $300, determined that Son had a learning disability. Based upon the report, the school board placed Son in special classes. At an open meeting of the school board, Parents asked that the $300 they had paid to the psychologist be reimbursed by the school district. A reporter attending the meeting wrote a newspaper article about this request, mentioning Son by name. In a privacy action brought by Son's legal representative against the newspaper, the plaintiff will
2160	The defendant was at work when her husband called her and said, "The neighbor just tripped over those roots I told you to take out. He's badly hurt and I'll bet he sues us for all we're worth." The defendant then told her secretary, "The neighbor just got hurt because I forgot to do my yard work." On returning home, however, the defendant discovered that the neighbor had actually tripped over roots from his own tree in his own yard. The neighbor disagreed and sued the defendant and her husband. At trial, the neighbor called the defendant's secretary to testify as to the defendant's statement to him. The secretary's testimony will be:
2161	Ohner owns the Acme Hotel. When the International Order of Badgers came to town for its convention, its members rented 400 of the 500 rooms, and the hotel opened its convention facilities to them. Badgers are a rowdy group, and during their convention they littered both the inside and the outside of the hotel with debris and bottles. The hotel manager knew that objects were being thrown out of the hotel windows. At his direction, hotel employees patrolled the hallways telling the guests to refrain from such conduct. Ohner was out of town and was not aware of the problems which were occurring. During the convention, as Smith walked past the Acme Hotel on the sidewalk, he was hit and injured by an ashtray thrown out of a window in the hotel. Smith sued Ohner for damages for his injuries. Will Smith prevail in his claim against Ohner?
2162	Olwen owned 80 acres of land, fronting on a town road. Two years ago, Olwen sold to Buck the back 40 acres. The 40 acres sold to Buck did not adjoin any public road. Olwen's deed to Buck expressly granted a right-of-way over a specified strip of Olwen's retained 40 acres, so Buck could reach the town road. The deed was promptly and properly recorded. Last year, Buck conveyed the back 40 acres to Sam. They had discussed the right-of-way over Olwen's land to the road, but Buck's deed to Sam made no mention of it. Sam began to use the right-of-way as Buck had, but Olwen sued to enjoin such use by Sam. The court should decide for
2163	Which of the following items of evidence is LEAST likely to be admitted without a supporting witness?
2164	The owner of a gardening service looking to purchase a lawnmower for his business asked a retailer if he would install a lightweight blade on a particular lawnmower that he liked, but which had a heavy duty blade on it designed for cutting thick weeds. The retailer agreed and installed a lightweight blade designed for lawn cutting, but the blade was not designed to be used on that style of lawnmower. Two weeks later, while a worker for the gardening service was using the lawnmower to cut through a patch of heavy weeds, the blade broke and a piece of it flew off the lawnmower and severely cut the worker's leg. Assume that the jurisdiction follows traditional contributory negligence rules. If the worker asserts a claim based on strict liability in tort against the lightweight blade's manufacturer, the strongest defense is:
2165	A plaintiff sued a defendant in a contract dispute. The plaintiff calls a witness to testify as to his personal knowledge of the agreement. The plaintiff now wants a second witness to testify as to her knowledge of the first witness's honesty. The defendant objects and the court sustains the objection. The plaintiff may not bring the second witness to testify because:
2166	Professor Merrill, in a lecture in her psychology course at a private university, described an experiment in which a group of college students in a neighboring city rushed out and washed cars stopped at traffic lights during the rush hour. She described how people reacted differently-with shock, joy, and surprise. At the conclusion of her report, she said, "You understand, of course, that you are not to undertake this or any other experiment unless you first clear with me." Four of Merrill's students decided to try the same experiment but did not clear with Merrill. One subject of their experiment, Carr, said, "I was shocked. There were two people on each side of the car. At first I thought negatively. I thought they were going to attack me and thought of driving away. Then I quieted down and decided there were too many dirty cars in the city anyway." Charitable immunity has been abolished in the jurisdiction. If Carr asserts a claim against the students who washed his car, his best theory is
2167	Pam and Dora own adjoining lots in the central portion of a city. Each of their lots had an office building. Dora decided to raze the existing building on her lot and to erect a building of greater height. Dora has received all governmental approvals required to pursue her project. There is no applicable statute or ordinance (other than those dealing with various approvals for zoning, building, etc.). Assume that no problems with subsidence or other misadventures occurred during construction of Dora's new building. However, when it was completed, Pam discovered that the shadow created by the new higher building placed her building in such deep shade that her ability to lease space was diminished and that the rent she could charge and the occupancy rate were substantially lower. Assume that these facts are proved in an appropriate action Pam instituted against Dora for all and any relief available. Which of the following is the most appropriate comment concerning this lawsuit?
2168	A college student owned a very popular video game system that was out of stock in most stores. He agreed to let his friend use the system for a few days, on condition that he return the system by the weekend because the student was hosting a small party. On the morning of the party, the friend still had not returned the game system, so the student went to the friend's apartment and demanded it back. The friend refused, so the student grabbed the system and wrestled it out of the friend's hands. If the friend sues the student for battery, will he recover on this claim?
2169	Congress enacts a criminal statute prohibiting "any person from interfering in any way with any right conferred on another person by the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment." Application of this statute to Jones, a private citizen, would be most clearly constitutional if Jones with threats of violence coerces
2170	The Federal Family Film Enhancement Act assesses an excise tax of 10% on the price of admission to public movie theaters when they show films that contain actual or simulated scenes of human sexual intercourse. Which of the following is the strongest argument against the constitutionality of this federal act?
2171	A motorist who failed to stop at a stop sign was struck by a car being taken for a test drive by a mechanic who had repaired the car's brakes. The motorist sued the repair shop that employed the mechanic to recover for his injuries. At trial, he called a bystander to testify that when the mechanic saw that the motorist was injured, the mechanic ran over and told him, "I'm really sorry. I guess I didn't fix the brakes as well as I thought." The repair shop's objection to the bystander's testimony should be:
2172	Perkins and Morton were passengers sitting in adjoining seats on a flight on Delval Airline. There were many empty seats on the aircraft. During the flight, a flight attendant served Morton nine drinks. As Morton became more and more obviously intoxicated and attempted to engage Perkins in a conversation, Perkins chose to ignore Morton. This angered Morton, who suddenly struck Perkins in the face, giving her a black eye. If Perkins asserts a claim for damages against Delval Airline based on battery, she will
2173	In a prosecution of Dahle for assault, Wharton is called to testify that the victim, Valerian, had complained to Wharton that Dahle was the assailant. Wharton's testimony is most likely to be admitted if Wharton is
2174	A robber approached a newsstand, with her knife drawn, in an attempt to rob the attendant. The attendant gave the robber the small sum of money in his possession. As the robber turned away, the attendant grabbed a gun and fired several times. He intended only to wound the robber but instead killed her. If the attendant cannot be prosecuted for manslaughter, it will be because:
2175	A father purchased a tract of land, financing a large part of the purchase price by a loan from a bank that was secured by a mortgage on the land. A provision in the mortgage agreement, which had an acceleration clause, provided that a defaulting borrower waives his right to redeem once foreclosure proceedings have started. The bank properly recorded its mortgage. Several years later, the father needed money to send his twin daughters to college, so he obtained a loan from a credit union, also secured by a mortgage on the land. The credit union properly recorded its mortgage. The following year, the father became ill and was unable to make payments to either the bank or the credit union due to his high medical bills. The balance on the loan from the bank was $75,000, and the balance on the credit union loan was $25,000. The bank instituted foreclosure proceedings in a jurisdiction that provides a statutory right of redemption. The day before the judicial sale, the father inherited $100,000 from his aunt. He quickly contacted the bank and offered to pay off both loans in full. The bank refused because it was hoping to buy the now valuable property at the judicial sale. If the father seeks to force the bank to accept his offer, he will:
2176	Three states, East Winnetka, Midland, and West Hampton, are located next to one another in that order. The states of East Winnetka and West Hampton permit the hunting and trapping of snipe, but the state of Midland strictly forbids these activities in order to protect snipe, a rare species of animal, from extinction. The state of Midland has a state statute that provides, "Possession of snipe traps is prohibited. Any game warden finding a snipe trap within the state shall seize and destroy it." Snipe traps cost about $15 each. Prentis is a resident of West Hampton and an ardent snipe trapper. She drove her car to East Winnetka to purchase a new improved snipe trap from a manufacturer there. In the course of her trip back across Midland with the trap in her car, Prentis stopped in a Midland state park to camp for a few nights. While she was in that park, a Midland game warden saw the trap, which was visible on the front seat of her car. The warden seized the trap and destroyed it in accordance with the Midland statute after Prentis admitted that the seized item was a prohibited snipe trap. No federal statutes or federal administrative regulations apply. For this question only, assume that Prentis demonstrates that common carriers are permitted to transport snipe traps as cargo across Midland for delivery to another state and that in practice the Midland statute is enforced only against private individuals transporting those traps in private vehicles. If Prentis challenges the application of the Midland statute to her on the basis only of a denial of equal protection, the application of the statute will probably be found
2177	A defendant is charged with the burglary of a warehouse. At the request of the police investigating the burglary, the night watchman at the warehouse who had seen the thief leaving the premises wrote out a description of the thief, who bore a strong likeness to the defendant. However, the night watchman died of a heart attack before the defendant was arrested and brought to trial. The prosecution attempts to offer the description written out by the night watchman into evidence. The description is:
2178	Another driver and the defendant were racing along a two-lane road. While the other driver tried to pass in the lane to the left of the center line, the plaintiff's car came into view, heading directly at the driver's vehicle. The driver lost control of his vehicle and collided with the plaintiff's car. The defendant's car, having already passed the plaintiff's car, was not involved in the collision. The plaintiff brings suit against the defendant for damages suffered in the collision. Which of the following would be the defendant's best course of action?
2179	Two law students ranked high in their class were competing for one opening at a prestigious law firm. During the interview with the hiring partner, one student was asked what he thought of the other's work as an editor of the law review. The student responded that there was a rumor around the school that the editor got outside help on her law review comment. Based in large part on his statement, that student was chosen over the law review editor, who later accepted a less lucrative position with another firm. If the law review editor brings a slander action against the other student and establishes the above facts, will she prevail?
2180	A pedestrian walking on the sidewalk was struck by a car backing out of a driveway. The driver did not see the pedestrian because her neighbor's bushes obscured her view of the sidewalk. The pedestrian was seriously injured and brought suit against the driver and the neighbor. The pedestrian also included the city in his lawsuit, alleging that the city failed to enforce its ordinance requiring homeowners to provide a clear view of sidewalks where they intersect with driveways. The trier of fact determined that the driver was 60% at fault, the neighbor was 30% at fault, and the city was 10% at fault. The jurisdiction has adopted comparative contribution in cases applying joint and several liability. Which of the following is a correct statement regarding liability?
2181	A homeowner and a carpenter formed a valid oral contract in which the carpenter agreed to construct an extension to the homeowner's home, using materials supplied by the homeowner, in exchange for $2,000. After the work had been completed but before the homeowner had made any payment, the carpenter called the homeowner and instructed him to pay the $2,000 due on the extension work to a creditor of the carpenter. If the creditor thereafter brings an action against the homeowner for $2,000, will the creditor prevail?
2182	Airco operates an aircraft maintenance and repair business serving the needs of owners of private airplanes. Flyer contracted with Airco to replace the engine in his plane with a more powerful engine of foreign manufacture. Airco purchased the replacement engine through a representative of the manufacturer and installed it in Flyer's plane. A short time after it was put into use, the new engine failed, and the plane crashed into a warehouse owned by Landers, destroying the warehouse and its contents. Airco was guilty of no negligence in the procurement, inspection, or installation of the engine. The failure of the engine was caused by a defect that would not be disclosed by inspection and testing procedures available to an installer. There was no negligence on the part of Flyer, who escaped the disabled plane by parachute. Landers recovered a judgment for damages from Flyer for the destruction of his warehouse and its contents, and Flyer has asserted a claim against Airco to recover compensation on account of that liability. In that action, Flyer will recover
2183	Ohner holds title in fee simple to a tract of 1,500 acres. He desires to develop the entire tract as golf course, country club, and residential subdivision. He contemplates forming a corporation to own and to operate the golf course and country club: the stock in the corporation will be distributed to the owners of lots in the residential portions of the subdivision, but no obligation to issue the stock is to ripen until all the residential lots are sold. The price of the lots is intended to return enough money to compensate Ohner for the raw land, development costs (including the building of the golf course and the country club facilities), and developer's profit, if all of the lots are sold. Ohner's market analyses indicate that he must create a scheme of development that will offer prospective purchasers (and their lawyers) a very high order of assurance that several aspects will be clearly established: 1. Aside from the country club and golf course, there will be no land user other than for residential use and occupancy in the 1,500 acres. 2. The residents of the subdivision will have unambiguous right of access to the club and golf course facilities. 3. Each lot owner must have an unambiguous right to transfer his lot to a purchaser with all original benefits. 4. Each lot owner must be obligated to pay annual dues equal to a pro rata share (based on the number of lots) of the club's annual operating deficit (whether or not such owner desires to make use of club and course facilities). In the context of all aspects of the scheme, which of the following will offer the best chance of implementing the requirement that each lot owner pay annual dues to support the club and golf course?
2184	Bitz, an amateur computer whiz, agreed in writing to design for the Presskey Corporation, a distributor of TV game systems, three new games a year for a five-year period. The writing provided, in a clause separately signed by Bitz, that "No modification shall be binding on Presskey unless made in writing and signed by Presskey's authorized representative." Because of family problems, Bitz delivered and Presskey accepted only two game-designs a year for the first three years; but the games were a commercial success and Presskey made no objection. Accordingly, Bitz spent substantial sums on new computer equipment that would aid in speeding up future design work. In the first quarter of the fourth year, however, Presskey terminated the contract on the ground that Bitz had breached the annualquantity term. In Bitz's suit against Presskey for damages, the jury found that the contract had been modified by conduct and the trial court awarded Bitz substantial compensatory damages. Is this result likely to be reversed on appeal?
2185	Defendant is on trial for nighttime breaking and entering of a warehouse. The warehouse owner had set up a camera to take infrared pictures of any intruders. After an expert establishes the reliability of infrared photography, the prosecutor offers the authenticated infrared picture of the intruder to show the similarities to Defendant. The photograph is
2186	A widow wanting to give her daughter a special wedding gift entered into a written agreement with a contractor to build a house for $300,000 on property she owned. Detailed specifications regarding the layout and materials to be used were included in the written agreement between the widow and the contractor. Just as the contractor was about to begin construction of the house, he discovered that an underground river bisected the widow's property, leaving insufficient subterranean support to construct the house as planned. Given this discovery, the contractor refused to build the house for $300,000. If the widow files suit demanding specific performance or damages from the contractor, which of the following additional facts, if proven, would most favor her case?
2187	In response to the latest energy crisis, an oil company began testing a new method of extracting oil from certain types of subsurface rock. The process used concentrated sound waves to pulverize the rock and draw out the oil. The tests, conducted in a sparsely populated area, caused heavy vibrations in the ground and the slumping of subsurface earth structures surrounding the test site. This led to the collapse of a water well on a rancher's property. If the rancher brings a negligence action against the oil company, which of the following would be most helpful to the oil company in avoiding liability?
2188	A state statute provides that only citizens of the United States may be employed by that state. In an action brought in a federal court, a resident alien who was prevented from obtaining state employment as a garbage collector solely because of his alien status challenged the statute's constitutionality as applied to his circumstances. Which of the following statements concerning the burden of persuasion applicable to this suit is correct?
2189	Bill and Chuck hated Vic and agreed to start a fight with Vic and, if the opportunity arose, to kill him. Bill and Chuck met Vic in the street outside a bar and began to push him around. Ray, Sam, and Tom. who also hated Vic, stopped to watch. Ray threw Bill a knife. Sam told Bill, ''Kill him." Tom. who made no move and said nothing, hoped that Bill would kill Vic with the knife. Chuck held Vic while Bill stabbed and killed him. On a charge of murdering Vic, Tom is
2190	A driver was driving north on a local road when his car went out of control, crossed the center line, and struck the vehicle of another driver who was driving south on the same road. Immediately after the accident, an off-duty officer came by and photographed the accident scene for the police report. In a suit between the drivers, the plaintiff seeks to introduce the photograph taken by the officer. The officer is present in court but has not been called as a witness. Is the photograph of the scene of the accident admissible?
2191	Suspecting criminal activity, a police officer acting without a warrant peeked through a small opening in the shutters of an apartment. The officer observed the apartment's tenant and the defendant making methamphetamine. The officer immediately entered the apartment and arrested the tenant and the defendant, and he confiscated the ingredients for the methamphetamine, the tools used for methamphetamine production, and any completed methamphetamine for evidence. The search is later ruled invalid at a suppression hearing. May the defendant now claim that her Fourth Amendment rights have been violated by the seizure of the ingredients, tools, and methamphetamine from the apartment?
2192	Cycle Company manufactured a bicycle that it sold to Bike Shop, a retail bicycle dealer, which in turn sold it to Roth. Shortly thereafter, while Roth was riding the bicycle along a city street, he saw a traffic light facing him turn from green to yellow. He sped up, hoping to cross the intersection before the light turned red. However, Roth quickly realized that he could not do so and applied the brake, which failed. To avoid the traffic that was then crossing in front of him, Roth turned sharply to his right and onto the sidewalk, where he struck Perez, a pedestrian. Both Perez and Roth sustained injuries. If Perez asserts a claim based on negligence against Cycle Company and if it is found that the brake failure resulted from a manufacturing defect in the bicycle, will Perez prevail?
2193	Debtor's $1,000 contractual obligation to Aunt was due on July 1. On the preceding June 15, Aunt called Niece and said, "As my birthday gift to you, you may collect on July 1 the $1,000 Debtor owes me." Aunt also called Debtor and told him to pay the $1,000 to Niece on July 1. On July 1, Debtor, saying that he did not like Niece and wouldn't pay anything to her, paid the $1,000 to Aunt, who accepted it without objection. Will Niece succeed in an action for $1,000 against Debtor?
2194	Poole sued Darrel for unlawfully using Poole's idea for an animal robot as a character in Darrel's science fiction movie. Darrel admitted that he had received a model of an animal robot from Poole, but he denied that it had any substantial similarity to the movie character. After the model had been returned to Poole, Poole destroyed it. In order for Poole to testify to the appearance of the model, Poole
2195	A tenant agreed in writing to lease a retail site in a shopping mall from the owner of the property. The term of the tenancy was two years, and rent was payable in monthly installments at the beginning of each month. At the end of the second year, there had been no discussions between the tenant and the owner regarding renewal or termination. The tenant did not vacate the premises at the end of the term; instead, she sent a check for the next month's rent to the owner. The owner cashed the check and then informed the tenant that he was holding her to a new tenancy and a rent increase of 10%. What is the status of the tenancy that the owner created?
2196	Congress established a vaccination review commission to supervise the manufacturing and administration of childhood vaccinations. An administrative law judge had been appointed to his position by the commission chairperson. When a new administration came into office, the new commission chairperson removed the judge from his position as the ALJ, but offered the judge a position as an attorney in the enforcement division. The judge brought suit in federal court to enjoin the commission chairperson from removing him from his position. The judge should:
2197	A landowner was declared insane and committed to a state mental hospital 30 years ago. Five years after that, a trespasser entered onto the landowner's 200-acre parcel of land, which was enclosed by a barbed wire fence. A solid wood fence ran through the middle of the land, separating the property into approximately equal east and west parcels. The trespasser began grazing cattle on the west parcel; no one else has been in possession of any part of the 200 acres. The period of time to acquire title by adverse possession is 15 years. Thirteen years ago, the landowner was declared competent and released from the hospital, but he did nothing until this year, when he brought an action to eject the trespasser. The trespasser counterclaimed to quiet title in him. In this action, the trespasser will:
2198	A publisher entered into a contract with a paper manufacturer who used very fine materials, whereby the publisher was given the right to purchase all paper refined by the paper manufacturer for the next five years at a price set at 95% of the domestic market price at the time of delivery. The publisher agreed to purchase no less than 1,000 pounds of paper a week. At the time this contract was signed, the publisher gave written notice to the paper manufacturer that it intended to buy all paper produced by the paper manufacturer until further notice. The paper manufacturer then sold its business to a lumberprocessing company. What is the effect of this sale on the paper manufacturer's obligation to the publisher?
2199	A woman whose car was in the shop wanted to meet her friend at a restaurant a mile away from the woman's home. She noticed that her neighbor had forgotten to lock his bicycle upon returning home. The woman took her neighbor's bicycle and began riding it to the restaurant, intending to bring it back in the trunk of her friend's car after her dinner. She had ridden the bicycle a distance of two blocks when she was hit by a car that had gone through a red light. The bicycle was destroyed in the collision. If charged with larceny of the bicycle, the woman will most likely be found:
2200	Brown owned Blackacre, a tract of undeveloped land. Blackacre abuts Whiteacre, a tract of land owned by Agency, the state's governmental energy agency. At Whiteacre, Agency has operated a waste-to-electricity recycling facility for 12 years. Blackacre and Whiteacre are in a remote area and Whiteacre is the only developed parcel of real estate within a ten-mile radius. The boundary line between Blackacre and Whiteacre had never been surveyed or marked on the face of the earth. During the past 12 years, some of the trucks bringing waste to the Agency facility have dumped their loads so that the piles of waste extend from Whiteacre onto a portion of Blackacre. However, prior to the four-week period during each calendar year when the Agency facility is closed for inspection and repairs, the waste piles are reduced to minimal levels so that during each of the four-week closures no waste was, in fact, piled on Blackacre. Neither Brown nor any representative of Agency knew the facts about the relation of the boundary line to the waste piles. The time for acquiring title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is ten years. Last year, Brown died, and his son, Silas, succeeded him as the owner of Blackacre. Silas became aware of the facts, demanded that Agency stop using Blackacre for the piling of waste, and, when Agency refused his demand, brought an appropriate action to enjoin any such use of Blackacre in the future. If Agency prevails in that action, it will be because
2201	While fleeing from an armed robbery he had just committed, a man struck a pedestrian with his car, seriously injuring the pedestrian. The robber was soon apprehended and charged with armed robbery and reckless driving, both felonies. Just prior to trial, the pedestrian died from his injuries. The trial on the robbery and driving charges proceeded, and the robber was convicted of the armed robbery charge and acquitted of the reckless driving charge. The robber was then indicted under the jurisdiction's felony murder statute for causing the death of the pedestrian during the course of committing an armed robbery. The robber moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that a second trial would violate double jeopardy. The robber's claim is:
2202	The State of Aurora requires licenses of persons "who are engaged in the trade of barbering." It will grant such licenses only to those who are graduates of barber schools located in Aurora, who have resided in the state for two years, and who are citizens of the United States. Which of the following is the strongest ground on which to challenge the requirement that candidates for barber licenses must have been residents of the state for at least two years?
2203	The plaintiff sued the defendant for damages and injuries after the defendant's car struck the plaintiff's car in an intersection. The plaintiff wanted a witness who lived on the corner and had seen the accident to testify on his behalf. However, the witness's recollection of the accident was very fuzzy because the trial did not take place until almost three years after the accident. The night before she was scheduled to testify, the witness consulted her diary, in which she had noted at the time that the defendant's car did not come to a complete stop at the stop sign and entered the intersection, striking the car driven by the plaintiff after the plaintiff's car had already entered the intersection. The plaintiff's attorney called the witness to the stand, and she testified to those details. On cross-examination, the defendant's attorney asked the witness if she had consulted any materials to prepare for her testimony. The witness admitted that her recollection of the accident had been fuzzy and that she had consulted her diary the night before her testimony. The defendant's attorney immediately moved that the witness's testimony be stricken from the record. The court should rule that:
2204	A statute of the state of Wasminia prohibits the use of state-owned or state-operated facilities for the performance of abortions that are not "necessary to save the life of the mother." That statute also prohibits state employees from performing any such abortions during the hours they are employed by the state. Citizen was in her second month of pregnancy. She sought an abortion at the Wasminia State Hospital, a state-owned and state-operated facility. Citizen did not claim that the requested abortion was necessary to save her life. The officials in charge of the hospital refused to perform the requested abortion solely on the basis of the state statute. Citizen immediately filed suit against those officials in an appropriate federal district court. She challenged the constitutionality of the Wasminia statute and requested the court to order the hospital to perform the abortion she sought. In this case, the court will probably hold that the Wasminia statute is
2205	The criminal law of the state uses the common law elements to define the crime of burglary. The state also has a statute making "flashing" (exposing of sexual parts) a felony. One night, the defendant broke into the home of the victim, a young woman who lived in the defendant's neighborhood. He entered the victim's bedroom and opened his trench coat to "flash" at her. The victim screamed, and the defendant fled, taking nothing with him from the victim's home. At the time of the "flashing," the defendant was wearing long underwear, which was extremely difficult to remove and which the defendant knew he would not have time to remove. Thus, he did not in fact actually expose his sexual organs to the victim. The defendant knew about the "flashing" statute, but did not know that actual exposure of sexual organs is an element of the crime of "flashing," as defined in the statute. Can the defendant be convicted of burglary?
2206	A wealthy sportsman purchased a large old wooden sailing ship for $200,000. Although the boat was a classic, the sportsman wanted it to be modernized and made more comfortable. To that end, the sportsman entered into a written contract with a marine architect-engineer to draw up and then execute the modernization plans, for $7,500. At the time the parties entered into the agreement, the sportsman told the architect-engineer that his modernization plan would be subject to the approval of the sportsman's sister, that they would, in fact, have no deal unless the plans meet with her approval. The architect-engineer agreed to this. He finished his drawings and submitted them to the sportsman, who was enthusiastic about the designs. The sportsman's sister, a famous yachtswoman, was engaged ina trans-Pacific yacht race at the time and was not expected home for a number of weeks. Cheered by the sportsman's enthusiasm, the architectengineer went ahead and modernized the ship according to his designs. When he finished the work, he submitted a bill to the sportsman, who refused to pay, pointing out that his sister had never approved the designs. If the architect-engineer sues the sportsman, which of the following issues of contract law is most likely to be decisive in determining the outcome of the case?
2207	A mechanic ran a car repair shop that specialized in repairing antique cars, and he also sold antique cars from time to time that he had repaired in the shop. Right before the shop closed, a customer brought him an antique car for repair. Although he knew that he would be unable to repair the car, the mechanic nonetheless wanted to inspect the car and see if there would be any usable parts should the customer decide to sell the car. He lied to the customer that he would work on it the first thing in the morning. That night, one of the mechanic's creditors walked by the shop and saw the antique car standing in the shop's parking lot. Remembering that the mechanic had fallen behind on his loan payments, the creditor decided to take the car, believing it to be one that the mechanic was going to sell. Finding the car keys in the visor, the creditor tried to start the car, initially to no avail. However, the car finally started, but it moved only a couple of feet before it stalled again, permanently. If the creditor is accused of grand larceny, his most promising defense would be:
2208	A homeowner heard a strange noise one night. She took a handgun from her nightstand and began to inspect her home. The homeowner's neighbor had also heard the strange noise. He walked out of his house and onto the homeowner's front lawn, thinking that the sound came from the homeowner's home. He stood silently on her lawn, listening. When the homeowner was near the front door, her cat playfully charged into her, causing her to drop the gun. The gun hit the floor and discharged. The bullet went through the homeowner's front window and struck the neighbor in the shoulder. If the neighbor sues the homeowner on a battery theory, he will:
2209	Smith and Penn were charged with murder. Each gave a confession to the police that implicated both of them. Smith later retracted her confession, claiming that it was coerced. Smith and Penn were tried together. The prosecutor offered both confessions into evidence. Smith and Penn objected. After a hearing, the trial judge found that both confessions were voluntary and admitted both into evidence. Smith testified at trial. She denied any involvement in the crime and claimed that her confession was false and the result of coercion. Both defendants were convicted. On appeal, Smith contends her conviction should be reversed because of the admission into evidence of Penn's confession. Smith's contention is
2210	The plaintiff, who was formerly married to the defendant's wife, sued the defendant, claiming that they had entered into an oral agreement whereby the defendant agreed to hire the plaintiff as chief engineer and the plaintiff agreed to take the job at a specified salary, and that the defendant had subsequently breached their employment contract by refusing to hire the plaintiff. At the trial of the plaintiff's suit, the defendant took the stand and denied having any contract with the plaintiff for employment or otherwise. In response, the plaintiff offers into evidence a properly authenticated phone message to the defendant's wife that the defendant had left with the switchboard operator at her office soon after the agreement. The message stated, "I know you won't be happy, but I've offered the chief engineer position to your ex-husband and he's accepted." The defendant's attorney objects. The phone message should be ruled:
2211	In March, when Ohm was 17, Stereo delivered to Ohm a television set. At that time Ohm agreed in writing to pay $400 for the set on July 1 when he would reach his 18th birthday. Eighteen is the applicable statutory age of majority, and on that date Ohm was to receive the proceeds of a trust. On July 1, when the reasonable value of the television set was $250, Ohm sent Stereo a signed letter stating, "I'll only pay you $300; that is all the set is worth." In an action against Ohm for money damages on July 2, what is the maximum amount that Stereo will be entitled to recover?
2212	A store selling secondhand office equipment advertised used Regal Typewriters for sale at its store, for $100 each. The administrator of a college dormitory whose residents included a number of computer-phobic students mailed the store a check for $500 with a note ordering five used Regal Typewriters, as advertised. Upon checking his stock, the store owner found that he had only two Regals left, but he had plenty of Overwoods, and therefore he sent the administrator two Regals and three Overwoods by common carrier. The legal effect of the store owner's shipment of the two Regals and three Overwoods in response to the administrator's order for five Regals was:
2213	A state law grants each county great autonomy in setting the health standards governing the preparation, packaging, transportation, and sale of food items. A county council recently enacted an ordinance, valid under the constitution and statutes of the state, prohibiting the packaging and sale of any food item in any non-biodegradable material; the ordinance defines non-biodegradable and specifically lists as prohibited all forms of plastics, cellophane, or similar materials. The ordinance specifically exempts from its terms sales of food to public institutions such as hospitals, jails, and schools. A retail food seller in the county files an appropriate court action attacking the county ordinance on the grounds that it violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court should rule:
2214	The owner in fee simple of a tract of land told his favorite nephew, "I've always liked you, so I'm going to leave you my land when I die." The nephew, who was being pressured by his friend to pay off an old debt, executed and delivered to her a general warranty deed to the tract of land. The friend immediately recorded the deed. The owner died shortly thereafter. His will left the tract of land to his nephew. Which of the following best describes the effect of the nephew's deed to the friend at the time it was recorded?
2215	An attorney won a large medical malpractice verdict against a doctor for a botched liposuction procedure performed on a patient. The patient was unaware that the doctor was board-certified only in dermatology but not in plastic surgery. In a televised interview in which he discussed the trial, the attorney stated that "doctors who are not board-certified need to notify their patients regarding their true qualifications." The doctor brought a defamation action against the attorney based on the statement. Who will prevail?
2216	A boy and his parents sued a driver for $75,000 for injuries they claim were caused when the driver's car hit the boy one night when the boy was out delivering papers. The boy was knocked unconscious in the accident, and the driver claims that it was not his car that hit the boy. Except for damages, the main issue in the suit is whether it was the driver's car that hit the boy. The driver's own attorney asks him, "Could the boy have mistaken your car for another?" This question is:
2217	To reduce deer overpopulation in state forests, state Blue adopted a statute allowing anyone with a valid deer hunting license from any state to hunt deer within state Blue. The act also imposed a $0.25 per pound tax on each deer killed within the state. Funds from the tax were earmarked to support state forest land. State Red is adjacent to state Blue and also has an overabundance of deer. To encourage hunting, state Red does not impose a tax on deer taken from its forests. A hunter who is a resident of state Red and who is licensed to hunt there earns his living by supplying wild game to several high-end restaurants in state Red. While legally hunting deer within state Red, the hunter inadvertently crossed the state line and killed a deer in state Blue. Upon hearing the hunter's shot, a state Blue game warden arrived at the scene, approximated the weight of the kill, and handed the hunter a tax bill based on the approximation. The bill provided a method for challenging the approximated weight of the deer, but the hunter refused to pay any tax on his kill. He instead filed suit in federal court to enjoin collection of the state Blue tax on constitutional grounds. Which of the following results is most likely?
2218	The plaintiff sued the defendant for bodily injuries suffered by the plaintiff as a result of a collision between the cars they were driving. The accident occurred on a rainy day, when the defendant's car skidded across the center line and struck the plaintiff's car. A principal issue is whether the defendant was driving too fast for the wet conditions. At trial, the plaintiff calls a witness who is prepared to testify that he has lived next door to the defendant for 15 years, and that the defendant is notorious in the neighborhood for driving his car at excessive rates of speed. The defendant's attorney objects. May the witness's testimony be allowed?
2219	A buyer entered into a written contract with a farmer to purchase the farmer's dairy farm. The contract contained a provision that the farmer's "land and inventory are valued at $175,000." The contract also contained a provision that stated, "This contract represents the entire agreement between the parties. No other promises or representations have been made." In a fraud action against the farmer, the buyer alleges that he purchased the farm only because the farmer had assured him that the land and inventory were worth $350,000, when they were in fact worth only $175,000. The buyer seeks to testify that during negotiations the farmer had said repeatedly that the value of the land and the inventory was $350,000, but at the advice of the farmer's attorney, he was going to list the value at $175,000 in the contract for tax purposes. The farmer's attorney objects. The evidence is:
2220	Paul sued Dyer for personal injuries sustained when Dyer's car hit Paul, a pedestrian. Immediately after the accident, Dyer got out of his car, raced over to Paul, and said, "Don't worry, I'll pay your hospital bill." Paul's testimony concerning Dyer's statement is
2221	While at a party, a wife came up behind a younger woman, grabbed her by her arm, and accused her of having an affair with the wife's husband. The wife knew that her accusation was not true. Of the following facts, which would be most helpful to the younger woman in a suit against the wife for intentional infliction of emotional distress?
2222	During the defendant's trial for battery, a witness testified that he did not see the altercation but that he heard an eyewitness shout, "A fight! The man in the red shirt just punched the man in the yellow shirt in the face!" Previous evidence has established that the defendant was wearing a red shirt. The defendant offers to call a witness who will testify that he spoke with the eyewitness the day after the altercation and that the eyewitness said, "The man in the yellow shirt was punching the man in the red shirt." The eyewitness cannot be found to testify. Should this evidence be admitted?
2223	In an arson prosecution the government seeks to rebut Defendant's alibi that he was in a jail in another state at the time of the fire. The government calls Witness to testify that he diligently searched through all the records of the jail and found no record of Defendant's having been incarcerated there during the time Defendant specified. The testimony of Witness is
2224	An officer on routine patrol noticed a flashlight moving within a darkened house and stopped to investigate. The suspect, who had broken into the home to steal valuables, caught sight of the patrol car, dropped the bag of valuables as he was about to carry them out of the house, and tried to sneak out the back way. The officer saw him sneaking out and seized him. The suspect, who had a lock-picking device in his possession, pulled out two $100 bills from his wallet, stating that he did not take anything and would like to forget the whole thing. The officer took the money, stating that she would give him a break this time around, and let the suspect go. The officer is:
2225	Lawyers Abel and Baker are the members of the law partnership of Abel and Baker in a small town that has only one other lawyer in it. Abel and Baker do a substantial amount of personal injury work. Client was severely and permanently injured in an automobile collision when struck by an automobile driven by Motorist. Client employed the Abel and Baker firm to represent her in obtaining damages for her injuries. At the time Client employed Abel and Baker, the statute of limitations had six weeks to run on her claim. The complaint was prepared but not filed. Abel and Baker each thought chat the other would file the complaint. The statute of limitations ran on Client's claim against Motorist. Client has filed suit against Abel and Baker for negligence. That case is on trial with a jury in a court of general jurisdiction. In addition to proving that Abel and Baker were negligent, Client must establish, as a minimum, that she
2226	Test owned Blackacre, a vacant one-acre tract of land in State. Five years ago, he executed a deed conveying Blackacre to "Church for the purpose of erecting a church building thereon." Three years ago, Test died leaving Sonny as his sole heir at law. His duly probated will left "all my Estate, both real and personal, to my friend Fanny." Church never constructed a church building on Blackacre and last month Church, for a valid consideration, conveyed Blackacre to Developer. Developer brought an appropriate action to quiet title against Sonny, Fanny, and Church, and joined the appropriate state official. Such official asserted that a charitable trust was created which has not terminated. In such action, the court should find that title is now in
2227	A building contractor entered into a contract with the local college to remodel a residence hall during the summer. As specified by the contract, the work had to be completed before the fall semester began at the beginning of September. Because the contractor received a great deal of other maintenance business from the college, his price of $400,000 was significantly lower than other contractors and he was not going to demand payment until the work was completed. By the end of the first week in August, the contractor had completed 75% of the project and had expended $350,000 in labor and materials. At that time, however, a labor dispute between the contractor and his employees prompted most of the workers to walk off the job. Because prospects for a quick settlement of the dispute were doubtful, the contractor informed the college that he would not be able to meet the completion deadline. A week later, the college obtained another contractor who was able to finish the project by the end of August. The college paid him $150,000, which included a substantial amount of overtime for his workers. The increase in value of the residence hall due to the remodeling was $425,000. The original contractor, who had not been paid, files suit against the college, which files a counterclaim against him. What should the contractor recover from the college?
2228	A thief bribed the doorman of an apartment complex to provide him with the key to the apartment of a wealthy widow. The doorman believed that the thief planned to use the key to sneak into the widow's apartment and take valuables. Instead, the thief pretended to be a "good Samaritan" and returned the key to the widow. The thief felt that this ploy would gain him access to the widow's apartment, where he planned to sell her a "real estate limited partnership share" in nonexistent Florida property. The plan worked to a point. The doorman snuck into the security office and grabbed the key, which he then gave to the thief. The thief brought the key to the widow, who thanked him and invited him into her apartment. The thief attempted to sell the "limited partnership share" totthe widow, but she quickly surmised that the limited partnership was bogus and politely asked him to leave. On his way out, the thief decided to compensate himself for the money he spent on the bribe and secretly pocketed a small, but valuable, bronze statuette. If the doorman is arrested, of what crime or crimes could he be charged and convicted?
2229	Ventnor and Perk entered into a written contract under which Ventnor agreed to sell and Perk agreed to buy Blackacre, a tract of land. The contract expressly stipulated purchase price and financing arrangements, described the land, and provided that Ventnor, on payment of purchase price by Perk, would deliver a general warranty deed conveying marketable title in fee simple. A date one year after the date of the agreement was specified as the date for closing. One week later, Ventnor orally assented to Perk's entering into possession, pending closing approximately one year later. Perk took possession and, without Ventnor's knowledge, had a builder, at a cost of $8,000, build an addition to the dwelling house situated on Blackacre. Perk paid the builder in full. As of the date of closing, the addition enhanced the market value of the premises by $5,000. For this question only, assume that Perk did not quit possession and desired to close, but, at the time set for closing, it was discovered that Ventnor owned only an undivided three-fourths interest in Blackacre. Ventnor indicated an inability to acquire the outstanding one-fourth interest. Perk declined Ventnor's offer to convey all interest held for three-fourths of the agreed purchase price. Perk demanded reimbursement for permanent improvements and Ventnor refused. In an appropriate action to recover reimbursement, Perk should recover
2230	The defendant was on trial for murder. The defendant called a witness to testify to an alibi. On cross-examination of the witness, the prosecutor asked, "Weren't you on the jury that acquitted the defendant of another criminal charge?" The best reason for sustaining an objection to this question is that:
2231	One of the employees of a department store informed the chief of security that he suspected a customer of shoplifting. The employee pointed out the suspected shoplifter, but the security chief thought that the employee was pointing at a different woman. He waited until the woman had left the store and then followed her outside. He went up to the woman, pointed a gun at her, and told her she needed to return with him to the department store's security office. The woman did so, even though she insisted that she had not done anything wrong. The woman was kept waiting in the office for a few minutes until the employee informed the security chief that he had arrested the wrong woman. If the woman sues the department store on the theory of false imprisonment, she will:
2232	The State of Aurora requires licenses of persons "who are engaged in the trade of barbering." It will grant such licenses only to those who are graduates of barber schools located in Aurora, who have resided in the state for two years, and who are citizens of the United States. The requirement that candidates for licenses must be graduates of barber schools in Aurora is probably
2233	Peavey was walking peacefully along a public street when he encountered Dorwin, whom he had never seen before. Without provocation or warning, Dorwin picked up a rock and struck Peavey with it. It was later established that Dorwin was mentally ill and suffered recurrent hallucinations. If Peavey asserts a claim against Dorwin based on battery, which of the following, if supported by evidence, will be Dorwin's best defense?
2234	Two robbers planned to rob a local convenience store, with one using a gun to force the clerk to turn over all of the money in the cash register while the other stood lookout near the door. The robbery did not go as planned. Instead of turning over any cash, the store clerk tried to disarm the gunman. During their struggle for the gun, the lookout decided that her best course of action was to grab what she could and flee the scene. The lookout took a newspaper and a bag of potato chips and ran out of the store. On her way out, she heard a gunshot. Later that day, she learned from news accounts that the gun accidentally discharged, killing the gunman. After an investigation, the lookout was arrested. If the lookout is charged with felony murder, her most promising defense would be:
2235	Johnson took a diamond ring to a pawnshop and borrowed $20 on it. It was agreed that the loan was to be repaid within 60 days and if it was not, the pawnshop owner. Defendant, could sell the ring A week before expiration of the 60 days. Defendant had an opportunity to sell the ring to a customer for S125. He did so, thinking it unlikely that Johnson would repay the loan and if he did, Defendant would be able to handle him somehow, even by paying him for the ring if necessary. Two days later. Johnson came in with the money to reclaim his ring. Defendant told him that it had been stolen when his shop was burglarized one night and that therefore he was not responsible for its loss. Larceny, embezzlement, and false pretenses are separate crimes in the jurisdiction. It is most likely that Defendant has committed which of the following crimes?.
2236	The Daily Sun, a newspaper, printed an article that stated: Kitchen, the popular restaurant on the town square, has closed its doors. Kitchen employees have told the Daily Sun that the closing resulted from the owner's belief that Kitchen's general manager has embezzled thousands of dollars from the restaurant over the last several years. A decision on reopening the restaurant will be made after the completion of an audit of Kitchen's books. Plaintiff, who is Kitchen's general manager, brought a libel action against the Daily Sun based on the publication of this article. The parties stipulated that Plaintiff never embezzled any funds from Kitchen. They also stipulated that Plaintiff is well known among many people in the community because of his job with Kitchen. The case went to trial before a jury. The defendant's motion for a directed verdict in its favor, made at the close of the evidence, should be granted if the
2237	In recent years, several large corporations incorporated and headquartered in State A have suddenly been acquired by out-of-state corporations that have moved all of their operations out of State A. Other corporations incorporated and headquartered in State A have successfully resisted such attempts at acquisition by out-of-state corporations, but they have suffered severe economic injury during those acquisition attempts. In an effort to preserve jobs in State A and to protect its domestic corporations against their sudden acquisition by out-of-state purchasers, the legislature of State A enacts a statute governing acquisitions of shares in all corporations incorporated in State A. This statute requires that any acquisition of more than 25% of the voting shares of a corporation incorporated in State A that occurs over a period of less than one year must be approved by the holders of record of a majority of the shares of the corporation as of the day before the commencement of the acquisition of those shares. The statute expressly applies to acquisitions of State A corporations by both in-state and out-of-state entities. Is this statute of State A constitutional?
2238	A defendant is on trial for manslaughter after he hit a victim in a bar, causing the victim to fall and hit his head on the marble bar top. The defendant claims that he hit the victim in selfdefense after the victim lunged at him with a knife. During the prosecution's case, a witness testifies that she heard the victim's friend shout at the defendant, "You just killed a helpless man!" A defense witness is called to testify that he was there and does not remember hearing the victim's friend say anything. The defense witness's testimony is:
2239	For a valuable consideration, Amato, the owner of Riveracre, signed and gave to Barton a duly executed instrument that provided as follows: "The grantor may or may not sell Riveracre during her lifetime, but at her death, or if she earlier decides to sell, the property will be offered to Barton at $500 per acre. Barton shall exercise this right, if at all, within 60 days of receipt of said offer to sell." Barton recorded the instrument. The instrument was not valid as a will. Is Barton's right under the instrument valid?
2240	The plaintiff sued a local restaurant, claiming that she injured her teeth, gums, and mouth when she bit into a hamburger that contained a large, jagged piece of glass. The plaintiff called to the stand a waiter for the restaurant, who testified that, when he heard the plaintiff scream, he looked in her direction and saw her remove a piece of glass from her bleeding mouth. On cross-examination, the defense asked the waiter, "Isn't it a fact that three months ago you were fired by the restaurant for serving drinks to your friends and not charging for them?" The waiter responded, "Yes, but I wasn't trying to steal anything. I just forgot to charge them." The defense then asked, "Isn't it a fact that last month you threw a rock through the plate glass window at the restaurant?" The waiter replied, "That's not true; I was there but I didn't throw the rock." The defense then offered the testimony of a witness who was prepared to testify that she saw the waiter throw the rock through the restaurant's window. Assuming that there have been no criminal charges filed as a result of the broken window, the witness's testimony is:
2241	After a power outage, the stoplights at a busy intersection were blinking red for traffic going in every direction. By statute, motorists must come to a full stop at a blinking red traffic signal before proceeding through the intersection. Cars driven by the plaintiff and by the defendant arrived at the intersection at the same time. Due to inattention, neither one stopped for the signal and the cars collided in the intersection. The plaintiff sued the defendant for his injuries. The trier of fact determined that the plaintiff was more at fault than the defendant. The plaintiff will:
2242	An astronomer who had studied the moon for more than 20 years became convinced that the moon began sending him messages revealing how to achieve an afterlife. The astronomer created a website where he shared the secrets that the moon had revealed. He gained a sizeable following. A wealthy follower convinced the astronomer that they should build an observatory to serve as the national headquarters for the astronomer and his followers. The observatory was built, and the astronomer continued to study the moon from the observatory. He also held weekly meetings at the observatory at which he revealed the continuing messages that he received from the moon. Some followers attended the meetings regularly, and some watched the meetings via an Internet feed. After receiving his first state property tax bill for the observatory, the astronomer applied for a state property tax exemption that was available for houses of worship. After conducting an investigation, the state denied the observatory tax exempt status. The astronomer filed suit to overturn the denial. The state moved for a summary judgment, arguing that the exemption is available only for houses of worship and that, because the astronomer and his followers do not belong to a recognized religion, the observatory is not eligible for the exemption as a matter of law. How should the court rule on the motion?
2243	Devlin was the owner of a large subdivision. Parnell became interested in purchasing a Lot but could not decide between Lot 40 and Lot 41. The price and fair market value of each of those two lots was $5,000. Parnell paid Devlin $5,000, which Devlin accepted, and Devlin delivered to Parnell a deed which was properly executed, complete, and ready for recording in every detail except that the space in the deed for the lot number was left blank. Devlin told Parnell to fill in either Lot 40 or Lot 41 according to his decision and then to record the deed. Parnell visited the development the next day and completely changed his mind, selecting Lot 25. He filled in Lot 25 and duly recorded the deed. The price of Lot 25 and its fair market value was $7,500. Immediately upon learning what Parnell had done, Devlin brought an appropriate action against Parnell to rescind the transaction. If Devlin loses, the most likely basis for the judgment is that
2244	Victim, injured by Driver in an auto accident, employed attorney First to represent him in the matter. Victim was chronically insolvent and expressed doubt whether he could promptly get necessary medical treatment. Accordingly, First wrote into their contract his promise to Victim "to pay from any settlementtwith Driver compensation to any physician who provides professional services for Victim's injuries." The contract also provided that First's duties were "'nonassignable." First immediately filed suit against Driver. Victim then sought and received medical treatment, reasonably valued at S1,000, from Doctor, but failed to inform Doctor of First's promise. After receiving a bill from Doctor for $1,000, Victim immediately wrote Doctor explaining that he was unable to pay and enclosing a copy of his contract with First. Victim then asked First about payment of this bill, but First requested a release from their employment contract. stating that he would like to refer Victim's claim to attorney Second and that Second was willing to represent Victim in the pending lawsuit. Victim wrote a letter to First releasing him from their contract and agreeing to Second's representation. A copy of this letter was sent to Doctor. Second subsequently promised First to represent Victim and soon negotiated a settlement of Victim's claim against Driver which netted $1,000, all of which was paid by Victim to creditors other than Doctor. Victim remains insolvent. In an action by Doctor against First upon First's employment contract with Victim, if First attempted to use Victim's release as a defense, Doctor is likely to argue that
2245	Alice was held up at the point of a gun, an unusual revolver with a red-painted barrel, while she was clerking in a neighborhood grocery store. Dennis is charged with armed robbery of Alice. The prosecutor calls Winthrop to testify that, a week after the robbery of Alice, he was robbed by Dennis with a pistol that had red paint on the barrel. Winthrop's testimony is
2246	A grandfather told his granddaughter that she could have his house because he was moving to a retirement home, and entered into a valid contract to convey it to her. He promised her that he would have another wing added to the house in the back before turning it over to her, and entered into a written contract with a builder to construct the addition for his granddaughter. Before the grandfather had entered into the contract with the builder, the granddaughter had paid $5,000 for a 60-day option to purchase another house because she was not sure she would like the addition. However, when her grandfather showed her the plans for his house prepared by the builder, she liked it very much and decided to let her option to purchase the other house lapse. Shortly thereafter, the local zoning authority increased the minimum lot line setbacks, making it impracticable to put the addition on the back of the house. The builder offered to put an addition above the existing floor rather than in the back, and the grandfather agreed. After the granddaughter's option had lapsed, she discovered that the addition was now going up rather than in the back. She angrily demanded that the builder either build the addition according to the original specifications that she approved or pay her damages. The builder refused and the granddaughter filed suit. Who is more likely to prevail?
2247	A motorist was driving along a narrow, winding road when his car ran out of gas. Because the road had no shoulders, the motorist pushed his car onto the driveway of a landowner. Finding no one home at the house, the motorist started walking toward a gas station he had passed a mile back. While he was gone, the landowner returned and found the car in his driveway, with two of its wheels partially on his flower garden. Although the landowner had not posted any "no trespassing" signs, he believed he had the right to remove the car from his property. The car was unlocked, so he released the parking brake and pushed the car back onto the edge of the road, and then reset the brake. Before the motorist could return, a truck had sideswiped the car, damaging it. Can the motorist recover against the landowner for the damage to his car?
2248	Defendant is on trial for extorting $10,000 from Victim. An issue is the identification of the person who made a telephone call to Victim. Victim is prepared to testify that the caller had a distinctive accent like Defendant's, but that he cannot positively identify the voice as Defendant's. Victim recorded the call but has not brought the tape to court, although its existence is known to Defendant. Victim's testimony is
2249	State legislation established family counseling centers throughout the state targeting poor single-parent households, which were typically headed by a woman. Accordingly, the legislation provided that all counseling would be free for single mothers with an income of less than $20,000 per year. Others would have to pay fees for the counseling on a sliding scale depending on income. A single father raising two children on an income of approximately $7,000 per year objected to paying the sliding scale fee. A public interest law firm files suit in federal court on his behalf, alleging discrimination. Which of the following statements is most accurate?
2250	On April 10, the owner of a small farm mailed a letter to a new resident of the area who had expressed an interest in buying the farm. In this letter, the farm owner offered to sell the farm to the resident for $100,000. The offer expressly stated that the offer expires on June 1, "if acceptance by the offeree has not been received by the offeror on or before that date." On the morning of June 1, the resident sent a written acceptance to the farm owner by messenger. However, through negligence of the messenger company, the acceptance was not delivered to the farm owner until June 2. On June 4, the farm owner entered into a contract to sell the farm to another buyer for more money but did not inform the resident of the transaction. When the resident followed up by phone on June 10, the farm owner told him that he had sold the farm to another buyer. Which of the following is the most correct statement?
2251	Professor Merrill, in a lecture in her psychology course at a private university, described an experiment in which a group of college students in a neighboring city rushed out and washed cars stopped at traffic lights during the rush hour. She described how people reacted differently-with shock, joy, and surprise. At the conclusion of her report, she said, "You understand, of course, that you are not to undertake this or any other experiment unless you first clear with me." Four of Merrill's students decided to try the same experiment but did not clear with Merrill. One subject of their experiment, Carr, said, "I was shocked. There were two people on each side of the car. At first I thought negatively. I thought they were going to attack me and thought of driving away. Then I quieted down and decided there were too many dirty cars in the city anyway." Charitable immunity has been abolished in the jurisdiction. If Carr has a valid claim against the students, will he also prevail against the university?
2252	Jones, a marijuana farmer, had been missing for several months. The sheriffs department received an anonymous tip that Miller, a rival marijuana farmer, had buried Jones in a hillside about 200 yards from Miller's farmhouse. Sheriffs deputies went to Miller's farm. They cut the barbed wire that surrounded the hillside and entered, looking for the grave. They also searched the adjacent fields on Miller's farm that were within the area enclosed by the barbed wire and discovered clothing that belonged to Jones hanging on a scarecrow. Miller observed their discovery and began shooting. The deputies returned the fire. Miller dashed to his pickup truck to escape. Unable to start the truck, he fled across a field toward the barn. A deputy tackled him just as he entered the barn. As Miller attempted to get up, the deputy pinned his arms behind his back. Another deputy threatened, "Tell us what you did with Jones or we will shut you down and see your family on relief." Miller responded that he had killed Jones in a fight but did not report the incident because he did not want authorities to enter his land and discover his marijuana crop. Instead, he buried him behind the barn. Miller was thereafter charged with murder. If Miller moves to suppress his admission about killing his neighbor, the court should
2253	While walking on patrol in a commercial district in the early evening, a police officer noticed that a light was on in the back window of a machine shop. Curious about what was going on inside, the officer went to the back of the building and tried to look through the window of the shop, but it had been painted on the inside so that only a strip about three inches at the top, eight feet above ground level, was still transparent. The officer quietly brought two trash cans from a neighboring business over to the window, stood on them and saw, through the strip of unpainted window, that the shop owner's son was inside with a friend, sucking white powder into his nose through a rolled-up tube of paper from off a small mirror. Recognizing that the shop owner's son was snorting cocaine, the officer knocked at the front door to the shop, and the son let him in. The officer immediately arrested the owner's son and his friend. In the back room of the shop through whose window he had peered, the officer found and seized several grams of cocaine, a razor blade, and a mirror. In the subsequent prosecution of the shop owner's son for possession of cocaine, the owner's son seeks to bar introduction of the cocaine, mirror, and razor blade into evidence. His motion will probably be:
2254	Johnston bought 100 bolts of standard blue wool, No. I quality, from McHugh. The sale contract provided that Johnston would make payment prior to inspection. The 100 bolts were shipped, and Johnston paid McHugh. Upon inspection, however, Johnston discovered that the wool was No. 2 quality. Johnston thereupon tendered back the Wool to Mc Hugh and demanded return of his payment. Mc Hugh refused on the ground that there is no difference between No. 1 quality wool and No. 2 quality wool. What is Johnston's remedy because the wool was nonconforming?
2255	An employee of a garden supply store recently moved from an apartment to a house with a large yard, and he needed a mower. He could not afford the one he wanted, even with his employee discount, so one day at work he took the mower from the mower department and hid it behind some crates on the loading dock. He planned to take the mower home with him that night. At the end of the day, however, the employee became afraid that he would be caught, so he returned the mower to the mower department and went home as usual. The employee has most likely committed:
2256	A physician who was photographically documenting the deterioration of a terminally ill patient came into his room to take more photos as the patient's wife was saying her final goodbye. Ignoring the wife's protests, the physician lifted the patient's head and slid a sheet of blue cardboard underneath for a better background, and then took some photos as the patient expired. The wife is the patient's sole heir. The wife can recover against the physician for:
2257	Ventnor and Perk entered into a written contract under which Ventnor agreed to sell and Perk agreed to buy Blackacre, a tract of land. The contract expressly stipulated purchase price and financing arrangements, described the land, and provided that Ventnor, on payment of purchase price by Perk, would deliver a general warranty deed conveying marketable title in fee simple. A date one year after the date of the agreement was specified as the date for closing. One week later, Ventnor orally assented to Perk's entering into possession, pending closing approximately one year later. Perk took possession and, without Ventnor's knowledge, had a builder, at a cost of $8,000, build an addition to the dwelling house situated on Blackacre. Perk paid the builder in full. As of the date of closing, the addition enhanced the market value of the premises by $5,000. For this question only, assume that four months before the date for closing Perk quit possession and notified Ventnor that because of a change in location of employment Perk would not complete the transaction. Perk demanded that Ventnor pay $8,000 to Perk to reimburse the cost of permanent improvements. Ventnor declined. In an appropriate action to recover reimbursement, Perk should recover
2258	Tess Traviata owed Dr. Paula Pulmonary, a physician, $25,000 for professional services. Dr. Pulmonary orally assigned this claim to her adult daughter, Bridey, as a wedding gift. Shortly thereafter, on suffering sudden, severe losses in the stock market, Dr. Pulmonary assigned by a signed writing the same claim to her stockbroker, Margin, in partial satisfaction of advances legally made by Margin in Dr. Pulmonary's previous stock-market transactions. Subsequently, Traviata, without knowledge of either assignment, paid Dr. Pulmonary the $25,000 then due, which Dr. Pulmonary promptly lost at a horse track, although she remains solvent. Assuming that Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code does NOT apply to either of the assignments in this situation, which of the following is a correct statement of the parties' rights and liabilities?
2259	Congress passes a law regulating the wholesale and retail prices of "every purchase or sale of oil, natural gas, and electric power made in the United States." The strongest argument in support of the constitutionality of this statute is that
2260	A manufacturer of men's neckties received the following order from a retail store: "Ship 500 two-inch ties, assorted stripes, your catalogue No. V34." The tie manufacturer instead shipped 500 three-inch ties. The store manager immediately faxed the tie manufacturer: "Reject your shipment. Order was for two-inch ties." The store, however, did not ship the ties back to the tie manufacturer. Did the store properly reject the ties?
2261	Walker, a pedestrian, started north across the street in a clearly marked north-south crosswalk with the green traffic light in her favor. Walker was in a hurry, and so before reaching the north curb of the street, she cut to her left diagonally across the street to the east-west crosswalk and started across it. Just after reaching the east-west crosswalk, the traffic light turned green in her favor. She proceeded about five steps farther across the street to the west in the crosswalk when she was struck by a car approaching from her right that she thought would stop, but did not. The car driven by Driver, 81 years of age, who failed to stop his car after seeing that the traffic light was red against him. Walker had a bone disease, resulting in very brittle bones, that is prevalent in only 0.02 percent of the population. As a result of the impact Walker suffered a broken leg and the destruction of her family heirloom, a Picasso original painting that she was taking to her bank for safe-keeping. The painting had been purchased by Walker's grandmother for $750 but was valued at $500,000 at the time of the accident. Walker has filed suit against Driver. Driver's attorney has alleged that Walker violated a state statute requiring that pedestrians stay in the crosswalks, and that if Walker had not violated the statute she would have had to walk 25 feet more to reach the impact point and therefore would not have been at a place where she could have been hit by Driver. Walker's attorney ascertains that there is a statute as alleged by Driver, that his measurements are correct, that there is a state statute requiring observance of traffic lights, and that Driver's license expired two years prior to the collision. The violation of the crosswalk statute by Walker should not defeat her cause of action against Driver because
2262	Powers sued Debbs for battery. At trial, Powers' witness Wilson testified that Debbs had made an unprovoked attack on Powers. On cross-examination, Debbs asks Wilson about a false claim that Wilson had once filed on an insurance policy. The question is
2263	A tenant rented an apartment in a large multi-unit building. One day vandals broke into several of the building's apartments, including the tenant's, and smeared excrement into the carpets and on the walls, and broke out all of the windows. The jurisdiction provides by statute that if a tenant notifies her landlord in writing of a repair that is needed to keep the premises in a habitable condition and the landlord does not repair it within 15 days, the tenant may, at her option, either repair it herself and withhold the expenses from rent, or consider herself constructively evicted and terminate her tenancy. The tenant wrote a letter to the landlord informing him that her walls, carpets, and windows had been damaged and needed repair, and after eight days she received a letter in reply stating that such damages to her apartment were her responsibility to repair. After waiting another week, the tenant paid to have her carpets and walls cleaned and to have her windows replaced. She then withheld the entire next month's rent of $400, because the cleaning and repair bills had totaled $750. After sending her the required statutory notices, the landlord commenced unlawful detainer litigation, seeking to have the tenant evicted for nonpayment of rent. How should the court rule?
2264	A state passes a law allowing terminally ill patients to use marijuana under limited circumstances. Federal law, however, provides that marijuana may not be used under any circumstances. The state sues in federal district court, arguing that marijuana is beneficial for the terminally ill and should be permitted under these circumstances, despite the federal prohibition of marijuana use throughout the United States. The federal district court should rule that:
2265	A corporation whose subsidiaries include a major hotel chain planned to build a new hotel and advertised for bids to build the hotel within the next six months. Four bids were received, for $17 million, $17.2 million, $17.4 million, and $15 million. The corporation's chief financial officer reviewed the bids, then emphatically told the corporation's chief executive officer ("CEO") that there was "no way" the low bidder could make a profit on the $15 million bid. The CEO made no response. In fact, the builder had stayed up for 72 hours without sleep preparing the bid for the hotel project and had neglected to include the plumbing expenses in the bid. Typically, the cost of plumbing, including the shop's profit, would have been about $2 million. Shortly after the $15 million contract was signed by the CEO and the builder, the builder discovered his mistake and telephoned the CEO to tell her that he had forgotten to include the cost of plumbing, adding that he would normally charge $2 million for plumbing. The CEO agreed to pay the additional $2 million, but this arrangement was never reduced to writing. After the builder completed the project on time, the CEO sent him a check for only $15 million. Can the builder compel the CEO to tender the additional $2 million?
2266	Adam's car sustained moderate damage in a collision with a car driven by Basher. The accident was caused solely by Basher's negligence. Adam's car was still drivable after the accident. Examining the car the next morning, Adam could see that a rear fender had to be replaced. He also noticed that gasoline had dripped onto the garage floor. The collision had caused a small leak in the gasoline tank. Adam then took the car to Mechanic, who owns and operates a body shop, and arranged with Mechanic to repair the damage. During their discussion Adam neglected to mention the gasoline leakage. Thereafter, while Mechanic was loosening some of the damaged material with a hammer, he caused a spark, igniting vapor and gasoline that had leaked from the fuel tank. Mechanic was severely burned. Mechanic has brought an action to recover damages against Adam and Basher. The jurisdiction has adopted a pure comparative negligence rule in place of the traditional common-law rule of contributory negligence. In this action, will Mechanic obtain a judgment against Basher?
2267	In response to a telephone call, a report went out over the police radio requesting an ambulance because of a shooting. Several officers who heard the broadcast arrived at the subject residence and knocked on the front door, identifying themselves as police officers. Believing that someone inside the house had been shot, one of the officers entered the building through an unlocked window and opened the front door for the other officers to enter. While searching for victims, the officers saw, in plain view, several containers of cocaine. An occupant of the house was arrested and charged with possession of narcotics. At his trial, the occupant moved to suppress the evidence of the narcotics on the ground that the police officers' warrantless entry into his residence was improper. Did the police officers have a right to enter the building without a warrant?
2268	A tenant remained in possession of the house she was renting after her lease term had expired, prompting the landlord to begin eviction proceedings. While the tenant was still in the house, a heavy snowfall covered the driveway, requiring her to shovel the driveway so she could get her car out of the garage. Shortly after she finished shoveling, the tenant's neighbor used a snowblower to blow all of the snow from his driveway onto the tenant's driveway. Consequently, the tenant had to shovel it again before she could get her car out. A trespass action against the neighbor can be brought by:
2269	Construction Company contracted to build a laundry for Wash Company on the latter's vacant lot in a residential area. As a part of its work, Construction Company dug a trench from the partially completed laundry to the edge of a public sidewalk: waterlines were to be installed in the trench. Because of the contour of the land, the trench was dug to a depth ranging from 7 to 9 feet. Construction Company did not place any barriers around the trench and permitted it to lie open for almost a week while waiting for the delivery of water pipes. This was known to Wash Company, but it raised no objection. During the time the trench was open, a series of heavy rains fell, causing 5 feet of surface water to gather in the bottom of the trench. While this condition existed, 5-year-old Tommy, who was playing on the vacant lot with friends, stumbled and fell into the trench. Robert, an adult passerby, saw this and immediately lowered himself into the trench to rescue Tommy. However, his doing so caused the rain-soaked walls of the trench to collapse, killing both him and Tommy. In a claim for wrongful death by Tommy's administrator against Construction Company, the most likely result is that the plaintiff will
2270	An investor entered into a written agreement to purchase a parcel of land from a seller for $50,000, with closing to take place on July 1. Two weeks before the date set for closing, the investor entered into a written agreement to sell the same parcel of land to a buyer for $100,000, with closing to occur on August 1. On July 1, the investor received a deed to the land and informed the buyer that she would not be proceeding with their deal because she had received a better offer. If the buyer sues for specific performance, judgment will likely be for:

Walker's attorney ascertains that there is a statute as alleged by Driver, that his measurements are correct, that there is a state statute requiring observance of traffic lights, and that Driver's license expired two years prior to the collision. If Walker establishes liability on the part of Driver for her physical injuries, should Walker's recovery include damages for a broken leg?
2272	Peri sues Denucci for a libelous letter received by Investigator. The authenticity and contents of the letter are disputed. Investigator, if permitted, will testify that, "I received a letter that I cannot now find, which read: Dear Investigator, You inquired about Peri. We fired him last month when we discovered that he had been stealing from the stockroom. Denucci" The testimony should be admitted in evidence only if the
2273	Miller's, a department store, had experienced a growing incidence of shoplifting. At the store's request, the police concealed Best, a woman who was a detective, at a vantage point above the women's apparel fitting rooms where she could see into these rooms, where customers tried on clothes. Detective Best saw Davis enter a fitting room, stuff a dress into her pocketbook, leave the fitting room, and start for the street door. By prearranged signal, Best notified another police officer near the door, who detained Davis as Davis started to go out into the street. Davis was placed under arrest, and the dress was retrieved from her purse. Davis is charged with shoplifting. Her motion to prevent the introduction of the dress into evidence will be
2274	Morris was driving north on an interstate highway at about 50 miles per hour when a tractor-trailer rig, owned and driven by Dixon, passed her. The tractor was pulling a refrigerated meat trailer fully loaded with beef carcasses hanging freely from the trailer ceiling. When Dixon cut back in front of Morris, the shifting weight of the beef caused the trailer to overturn. Morris was unable to avoid a collision with the overturned trailer and was injured. The trailer had been manufactured by Trailco. A number of truckers had complained to Trailco that the design of the trailer, which allowed the load to swing freely, was dangerous. Dixon knew of the dangerous propensity of the trailer. A restraining device that could be installed in the trailer would prevent the load from shifting and was available at nominal cost. Dixon knew of the restraining device but had not installed it. If Morris asserts a claim based on strict liability tort against Trailco, she will
2275	A sailing enthusiast went to a boat builder and told him that he wanted a yacht built to his specifications. They agreed that the price would be $400,000, and that the sailing enthusiast was to make payment in full within 30 days after he had accepted delivery of the yacht. They further agreed that the boat builder would not subcontract any of the work. The boat builder, however, contacted a master sail maker and subcontracted the sails for the yacht to him. They agreed orally that the boat builder would pay the sail maker $25,000 for the sails within 20 days of receiving them. The boat builder did not tell the sail maker of his agreement with the sailing enthusiast regarding subcontracting. The sail maker made the sails and delivered them to the boat builder, who then completed the yacht and delivered the boat to the sailing enthusiast. Although the yacht was built to his specifications, the sailing enthusiast refused to accept it after he learned that the boat builder had subcontracted for the sails. When the 20-day payment period for the sails had expired, the sail maker went to the boat builder and demanded the $25,000. The boat builder told the sail maker that he could not pay the $25,000 unless the sailing enthusiast paid him for the yacht. Is there an enforceable contract between the sail maker and the boat builder?
2276	A buyer and seller entered into a written contract on March 31 for the sale of a beach house. Under the terms of the agreement, the buyer would purchase the house for $275,000, with 10% due at closing on May 1 and a 15-year mortgage. At the time the contract was entered into, the parties agreed orally that the written agreement would not become binding unless the buyer notified the homeowner, in writing, by the end of the day on April 15, that she had secured the proper financing. With the summer season approaching, the seller did not wish to risk any delay in selling the house if the buyer was not in a position to buy it. On the morning of April 15, the buyer's financing was approved. On April 16, the buyer telephoned the seller and told him that her financing had been approved. The buyer also told the seller that she was not able to get written confirmation to him by April 15 because of the postal workers' slowdown and because her fax machine just broke down. The seller assured the buyer that this was not a problem. However, before closing, the seller had a change of heart and decided not to sell the beach house after all. The buyer files an action for breach. The buyer's best argument would be based on:
2277	A state legislature adopted a statute requiring that state school districts be funded equally on a per capita basis, because the previous method of funding school districts based on the amount of taxes paid by residents of the district resulted in schools in the state's wealthiest district receiving twice as much funding per pupil as did schools located in poorer districts. A resident of the wealthy district whose children attend public schools brought an action in state court to have the new statute declared invalid. He established at trial that the disparities in the previous funding system were not based in any way on racial or ethnic discrimination. Nevertheless, when the case reached the state supreme court, it ruled that, based on a provision in the state constitution similar to the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution, all school districts in the state must be funded equally on a per capita basis. Subsequent to this decision, a taxpayer in a neighboring state sued in federal court, demanding equal per capita funding in his state's school districts. The taxpayer's case eventually reached the United States Supreme Court, which ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment does not compel equal funding, provided there is no probable racial discrimination in the funding. After that decision, the resident of the wealthy district who had lost his state court case filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to have the decision by his state supreme court overturned. The resident is most likely to:
2278	A music promoter planned to open a discotheque and bar on the outskirts of town. He hired a builder to build it, with a completion date of September 15. Although the promoter was very optimistic that the disco would be a big success, its profitability could not be determined with certainty. First year profits were estimated to be about $1,000 per day. To encourage the builder to work in a timely manner, the contract included a liquidated damages clause, providing that the builder would pay the promoter $10,000 per day for each day the contract ran over its completion date. The builder's work progressed smoothly and would have been finished on time, except that the builder failed to place in a timely manner his order for the disco's specially manufactured dance floor lighting. Consequently, the work was not completed until October 15. The promoter sued the builder for breach of contract. The builder called a witness who testified that the disco would have received $30,000 in income during that 30-day period and would have expended $20,000, leaving a profit of $10,000. How much should the builder be required to pay to the promoter in damages?
2279	Dorfman's dog ran into the street in front of Dorfman's home and began chasing cars. Peterson, who was driving a car on the street, swerved to avoid hitting the dog, struck a telephone pole, and was injured. If Peterson asserts a claim against Dorfman, will Peterson prevail?
2280	A water pipe burst in the basement of Supermart, a grocery store, flooding the basement and damaging cases of canned goods on the floor. The Plumbing contractor's workmen, in repairing the leak, knocked over several stacks of canned goods in cases, denting the cans. After settling its claims against the landlord for the water leak and against the plumbing contractor for the damage done by his workmen, Supermart put the goods on special sale. Four weeks later Dotty was shopping in Supermart. Several tables in the market were covered with assorted canned foods, all of which were dirty and dented. A sign on each of the tables read: "Damaged Cans-Half Price." Dotty was having Guest for dinner that evening and purchased two dented cans of tuna, packed by Canco, from one of the tables displaying the damaged cans. Before Guest arrived, Dotty prepared a tuna casserole which she and Guest ate. Both became ill and the medical testimony established that the illness was caused by the tuna's being unfit for consumption. The tuna consumed by Dotty and Guest came from the case that was at the top of one of the stacks knocked over by the workmen. The tuna in undamaged cans from the same Canco shipment was fit for consumption. If Guest asserts a claim against Dotty, Dotty most likely will
2281	A professional athlete was involved in a car accident after leaving his team's stadium following a game, and a child was killed. The child's parents brought a wrongful death lawsuit against the athlete, which eventually was settled. A reporter for a sports gossip website accurately reported that, as part of the legal settlement, the athlete was required to seek counseling for alcoholism. The website reporter incorrectly believed that she had received this information from a press release by the athlete's agent, but in fact it had been supplied by an unauthorized source, and no public information was released of the terms of the settlement. The athlete brought a privacy action against the website reporter based on the public disclosure of private facts. If the website reporter prevails, it will be because:
2282	A plaintiff has brought an action for personal injuries against a store, in connection with an incident in which he slipped and fell after the store's linoleum floors had been mopped. A major issue at trial is the degree of moisture that remained on the floor, because it had been mopped 45 minutes before the plaintiff walked on it. The store offers the testimony of an expert, who will testify about an experiment he conducted measuring the amount of time necessary for a linoleum floor to dry completely after having been mopped. Under what condition should the court admit this testimony?
2283	The state of Erehwon has a statute providing that an unsuccessful candidate in a primary election for a party's nomination for elected public office may not become a candidate for the same office at the following general election by nominating petition or by write-in votes. Sabel sought her party's nomination for governor in the May primary election. After losing in the primary, Sabel filed nominating petitions containing the requisite number of signatures to become a candidate for the office of governor in the following general election. The chief elections officer of Erehwon refused to certify Sabel's petitions solely because of the above statute. Sabel then filed suit in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of this Erehwon statute. As a matter of constitutional law, which of the following is the proper burden of persuasion in this suit?
2284	A group of doctors filed suit in federal court against the United States government to challenge a new statute that places caps on the amount that doctors, hospitals, clinics, and other medical facilities may charge patients to perform specifically enumerated procedures. The government filed a motion to dismiss the doctors' suit, arguing that the doctors lack standing to pursue their case. Which of the following is least relevant in determining whether the doctors have standing?
2285	At the trial of a lawsuit that arose out of a collision between the plaintiff's and the defendant's cars, the plaintiff's attorney calls an automobile mechanic as a witness, who testifies that he has 12 years' experience and was the only witness to the accident. The witness also testifies that he arrived at the scene immediately after the accident, which caused both cars to overturn, and saw the wheels on both cars still spinning. He testifies that the wheels of the defendant's car were spinning faster than the wheels of the plaintiff's car. The plaintiff's attorney asks the witness to testify as to what speed the respective cars were traveling at the time of the accident based upon his observations of the spinning wheels. The defendant's attorney objects. Should the testimony regarding the speed of the cars be admitted?
2286	A company that provided electrical and communication services to industries determined that its main trunk line of copper conduit needed to be replaced. The line ran through an industrial park, and the company had access to it by an easement. At the end of the workday on Friday, the copper conduit that had not yet been disconnected was left exposed in the trench. In accordance with the company's policy, intended to discourage theft of the copper, the conduit was still electrically charged. The next morning, a man was walking by the industrial park and saw the construction site. Ignoring the "no trespassing" signs, he came up to the trench and saw the copper conduit, which he decided to try to steal. He climbed over the barriers and climbed partway into the trench to try to pull out some of the conduit. He received an electric shock as he made contact with the conduit, causing him to fall into the trench and suffer severe electrical burns. If the man sues the company for his injuries, is he likely to prevail?
2287	Ben was the illegitimate, unacknowledged child of Fred. Fred died intestate, leaving neither spouse nor any children other than Ben. The state's law of intestate succession provides that an unacknowledged illegitimate child may not inherit his father's property. The spouse, all other blood relations, and the state are preferred as heirs over the unacknowledged illegitimate child. Ben filed suit in an appropriate court alleging that the state statute barring an illegitimate child from sharing in a parent s estate is invalid, and that he should be declared lawful heir to his father's estate. The state's strongest defense of the statute would be that
2288	In a suit attacking the validity of a deed executed fifteen years ago, Plaintiff alleges mental incompetency of Joe, the grantor, and offers in evidence a properly authenticated affidavit of Harry, Joe's brother. The affidavit, which was executed shortly after the deed, stated that Harry had observed Joe closely over a period of weeks, that Joe had engaged in instances of unusual behavior (which were described), and that Joe's appearance had changed from one of neatness and alertness to one of disorder and absentmindedness. The judge should rule Harry's affidavit
2289	Beth wanted to make some money, so she decided to sell cocaine. She asked Albert, who was reputed to have access to illegal drugs, to supply her with cocaine so she could resell it. Albert agreed and sold Beth a bag of white powder. Beth then repackaged the white powder into smaller containers and sold one to Carol, an undercover police officer, who promptly arrested Beth. Beth immediately confessed and said that Albert was her supplier. Upon examination, the white powder was found not to be cocaine or any type of illegal substance. If Albert knew the white powder was not cocaine but Beth believed it was, which of the following is correct?
2290	A businesswoman sold the resort hotel she owned to a speculator for $250,000. The speculator paid $100,000 down and agreed to pay the balance in equal monthly installments over the next 15 years. Two years later, the speculator sold the hotel to a conglomerate in exchange for the conglomerate's agreement to assume all of his obligations. The conglomerate agreed, and assumed the contract that the speculator had with the businesswoman. The following year, when her daughter decided to go to graduate school, the businesswoman wrote a letter to the speculator instructing him that the full payment should now go to her daughter until the businesswoman told him otherwise. The daughter was given a copy of this letter. Two years later, the conglomerate sold the hotel and all of the obligations back to the speculator. About this time, the daughter graduated and the businesswoman promised her niece that she would help her finance her studies in veterinary medicine, and she sent another letter to the speculator telling him to send the monthly installments to the niece. A year later, the businesswoman died, leaving all her cash (and the balance due on the note from the speculator) to her daughter. If the daughter were to sue the conglomerate to recover the sums paid to the niece, who would prevail?
2291	A state statute provided that directors of orphanages, homes for the developmentally disabled, and similar institutions stand in loco parentis to the children under their charge. A mentally disabled 11-year-old child lived in a state facility for the mentally disabled. The facility had no fence around it, because the children who lived there had been evaluated and judged not dangerous by behavioral health experts. One day, the child ran away from the premises. Despite the facility's prompt notification of the police, before the child was found he had beaten up a young boy he encountered on the street. The boy's parents filed suit against the director of the facility on the boy's beha If. Assuming that no other liability statute applies, who will prevail?
2292	A retailer and a supplier entered into a supply agreement. The supplier then assigned the agreement to a wholesaler for consideration. The retailer, unaware of the assignment, made payment to the original supplier. Which of the following is correct?
2293	A state statute makes it a felony for anyone in the corridors or on the grounds of any building in which a court may be in session to make a speech or carry a sign intended to improperly influence judicial proceedings. During a murder trial, a friend of the defendant was arrested under the statute for carrying a sign on the steps of the courthouse bearing the message: "Free the defendant or the judge will die." Can the friend constitutionally be convicted under the statute?
2294	After measuring skid marks and interviewing all eyewitnesses present at the scene of an automobile accident, an officer wrote out in longhand all the pertinent information on the standard police accident report form. The officer turned the report in to the department, where a police typist, according to the prescribed procedure, transcribed the officer's longhand record into a typed record which, after it was checked by the officer, was then placed on file in the police department. Two years later, the plaintiff sued the defendant for her injuries. The plaintiff called the officer to the stand to testify regarding the skid marks. The officer can remember nothing about the specific accident, as he has made at least 200 accident reports since the accident in question. After looking at the report, the officer can remember preparing the report but still cannot remember the accident scene. He wishes to read the information regarding the skid marks in the police report to the jury from the stand. The defense attorney objects. How should the court rule?
2295	Two men drinking at a local bar got into a heated argument. The small, slightly built man knew that the large burly man had a short fuse, yet continued to argue with him. The larger man insulted the smaller man's religion and national origin, whereupon the smaller man spat on the other, who responded by pouring a glass of beer over the smaller man's head. The smaller man then punched the larger man in the nose, catching him off guard and knocking him to the floor. The larger man got to his feet, pulled out a knife, and advanced toward the other, who was standing by the door. The smaller man reached inside his boot and drew out a small gun and shot the larger man, killing him instantly. The jurisdiction makes it a crime to carry a concealed weapon. The smaller man is charged with murder. If the smaller man claims the killing was in self-defense, which of the following is the most helpful to the prosecution?
2296	The owner of an old car parked it in front of his house with a "for sale" sign in the windshield. In response to an inquiry from his neighbor, the car owner said that he would take $400 for the car. The neighbor responded, "You've got a deal." Because it was a Sunday, and the banks were closed, the neighbor told the car owner that he would come to his house with the $400 the next day at about 6 p.m. The car owner said that was fine.At 9:15 the next morning, the car owner called his neighbor and told him that when they had talked the previous day, he forgot that he had just put two new tires on that car and that he would need an extra $50 to cover their cost. The neighbor agreed to bring $450 in cash to the car owner's house at about six o'clock. Is the neighbor legally bound to pay the car owner the additional $50?
2297	A boy was struck in the face by a metal bracket that flew off a lawnmower as he started it up. His mother was watching him from a window and became very upset when she saw the piece of metal strike him. She brought a lawsuit against a local mechanic who had recently repaired the mower, seeking recovery for her son's injury and the emotional distress she suffered. At trial, she presented evidence that the mechanic's negligent repair caused the bracket to fly off and hit her son. She also presented evidence that he suffered serious injuries when he was struck and testified that she suffered extreme distress when she saw him injured. At the close of her case, the mechanic moved for a directed verdict on the mother's emotional distress count. Should the court grant the motion?
2298	While dating, a man and woman purchased a parcel of land for $100,000, each contributing half the purchase price, and took title as joint tenants with right of survivorship. Two years after the couple were married, they separated. The man then quitclaimed all of his interest in the land to his brother, who duly recorded the deed. The jurisdiction has no applicable statute. The land is now held by:
2299	A woman was found strangled in the front seat of her car, and her friend was charged with her murder. At trial, the woman's sister testified that she had seen the friend riding in the front seat of the woman's car with the woman one hour before she was found dead. The friend testified in his defense that, two years ago, the woman had informed her sister and the friend that she had named the friend beneficiary of a $100,000 insurance policy issued on her life, and the sister became very angry. The friend was acquitted of the murder. The friend asked the insurance company to pay him the proceeds from the insurance policy on which he was named beneficiary. When the insurance company refused, the friend sued to force payment. The insurance company defended on the grounds that the friend had killed the woman. Because the sister had died by the time of the trial on the insurance policy, the insurance company offers into evidence a duly authenticated transcript of the sister's testimony from the murder trial. That transcript should be found to be:
2300	The driver of a tanker truck was transporting radioactive waste from a nuclear power plant to a permanent storage facility in a remote western region of the United States. After driving all night, the driver fell asleep at the wheel and the truck crossed over the center line, off the road, and onto a homeowner's property, coming to rest after crashing into several glass cases containing the homeowner's collection of poisonous snakes, the keeping of which was permitted by local ordinance. When the driver exited the truck, he was bitten on the leg by one of the poisonous snakes and became seriously ill. The driver brought an action against the homeowner for his injuries. The parties stipulated to the above facts, and that the driver violated a state statute by driving off of the road. Both parties moved for judgment as a matter of law on the liability issue. How should the court rule?
2301	A man spent the evening in the local bar and became inebriated. After leaving the bar, he got into a car that he thought was his, but was not. Because the keys were in the ignition, he was able to start the car and drive off. As he drove home, he pulled out his gun and fired randomly into a house, shooting and wounding a woman inside. In the resulting criminal trial, the man claims he was too drunk to know either that the car was not his or that there was anyone in the house. The man will be found:
2302	The owner of a factory that uses widgets in making its product and a widget maker entered into negotiations over the telephone and, after a time, reached a general understanding that the factory owner would buy widgets from the widget maker. Following their conversation, the widget maker sent the factory owner a contract, which he had already signed, agreeing to sell 1,000 widgets to the factory owner for a total contract price of $10,000. Upon receipt of the contract in the mail, the factory owner signed the contract and deposited an envelope containing the contract in the mailbox located in front of his workplace. Before the widget maker received the contract, the factory owner had a change of heart. He telephoned the widget maker and told him that he could not afford to buy the widgets he had ordered, and he was "not interested in that contract we talked about." The widget maker replied, "That's all right, I understand. Maybe we can do business some other time." The next day, the signed contract was delivered to the widget maker's office. The widget maker, also having had a change of mind, decided that he wanted to enforce the contract. Is the contract enforceable against the factory owner?
2303	Athlete, a professional football player, signed a written consent for his team's physician, Doctor, to perform a knee operation. After Athlete was under a general anesthetic, Doctor asked Surgeon, a world famous orthopedic surgeon, to perform the operation. Surgeon's skills were superior to Doctor's, and the operation was successful. In an action for battery by Athlete against Surgeon, Athlete will
2304	Dominique obtained a bid of $10,000 to tear down her old building and another bid of $90,000 to replace it with a new structure in which she planned to operate a sporting goods store. Having only limited cash available, Dominique asked Hardcash for a $100,000 loan. After reviewing the plans for the project, Hardcash in a signed writing promised to lend Dominique $100,000 secured by a mortgage on the property and repayable over ten years in equal monthly installments at 10% annual interest. Dominique promptly accepted the demolition bid and the old building was removed, but Hardcash thereafter refused to make the loan. Despite diligent efforts, Dominique was unable to obtain a loan from any other source. For this question only, assume that Dominique has a cause of action against Hardcash. If she sues him for monetary relief, what is the probable measure of her recovery?
2305	Mr. Denby was charged with the sale of narcotics. The federal prosecutor arranged with Mrs. Denby for her to testify against her husband in exchange for leniency in her case. At trial, the prosecution calls Mrs. Denby, who had been granted immunity from prosecution, to testify, among other things, that she saw her husband sell an ounce of heroin. Which of the following statements is most clearly correct in the federal courts?
2306	A motorist was negligently driving close to the shoulder of a highway when his vehicle skidded and hit a support column of a bridge that crossed over the highway. The impact from the car caused structural damage to the support column, which caused the bridge to drop 18 inches. The sag of the bridge was clearly visible from the highway. The motorist died in his heavily damaged car as a result of the accident. A rescuer, who had been five miles away at the time of the accident, came on the scene and pulled his car off the road to see if he could render assistance. Shortly thereafter, a trucker approached the scene of the accident. The trucker saw that an accident had occurred, and had adequate time to slow down or stop, but he proceeded ahead without reducing speed. Under ordinary circumstances, his truck could have passed easily under the bridge, but the 18-inch drop caused the top of the truck to strike the bridge. A chunk of concrete fell from the bridge, striking the rescuer in the head and seriously injuring him. If the rescuer sues the motorist's estate, who will prevail?
2307	A property owner owned a tract of land that he leased to a baker for 27 years. The baker built a large bakery on the property. The baker then sold the bakery building to a buyer, assigning the lease with the property owner's approval. The buyer has failed to make a rent payment for several months and has also failed to build the cafe that the baker had agreed to build in the original lease. The landlord of the property has a cause of action against:
2308	A large dairy regularly supplied milk to local grocery stores. A large grocery store located in the same city as the dairy had not previously done business with the dairy. It sent a written order to the dairy for 50 cases of homogenized whole milk at the wholesale market price of $10 per case for prompt shipment. The warehouse clerk at the dairy facility negligently shipped 50 cases of low-fat milk instead of the grade that was ordered. When the milk is delivered at the grocery store by a common carrier, which of the following is the most appropriate statement of the parties' rights and duties?
2309	A wholesale distributor of electronic poker games served the entire state in which it had its headquarters. There were no plants manufacturing the types of machines that the distributor sold within 1,000 miles of the state, and electronic poker games were in scarce supply. A retail seller sold mechanical and electronic games to taverns and convenience stores in the area. On August 3, the distributor sent a letter to the retail seller, which the retail seller received on August 5. The letter stated, in relevant part: "I now have in stock those 20 electronic poker games that you wanted for your business. I can guarantee delivery until September 2 at $2,000 per machine." On August 16, the distributor sold the 20 electronic poker games to an arcade owner at a price of $2,300 per machine. On August 17, the distributor faxed the retail seller: "Am revoking offer regarding poker machines; have already sold same at higher price." The retail seller received the fax the same day. During the month of August, a special session of the state legislature passed a bill declaring the sale of electronic gambling machines to be illegal in the state. The definition of electronic gambling machines included the electronic poker games distributed by the distributor. The governor signed the bill into law on August 28, and it became effective immediately. On August 30, the retail seller faxed the distributor: "Accept your offer to sell me 20 poker games at $2,000 per machine." The distributor received the fax the same day. If the distributor is not obliged to sell 20 electronic poker machines to the retail seller at $2,000 each, it will be because:
2310	On December 6, the owner of an electronics store sent a written request to a computer manufacturer asking for the price of a certain laptop computer. The manufacturer sent a written reply with a catalog listing the prices and descriptions of all of his available computers. The letter stated that the terms of sale were cash within 30 days of delivery. On December 14, by return letter, the store owner ordered the computer, enclosing a check for $4,000, the listed price. Immediately on receipt of the order and check, the manufacturer informed the store owner that there had been a pricing mistake in the catalog, which should have quoted the price as $4,300 for that computer. The store owner refused to pay the additional $300, arguing that his order of December 14 in which the $4,000 check was enclosed was a proper acceptance to the manufacturer's offer. In a suit for damages, will the manufacturer prevail?
2311	A landowner conveyed her parcel of land to a buyer. The buyer placed the deed in her safe deposit box but did not record the instrument before leaving town. Six months later, the landowner conveyed the same parcel of land to a farmer, who promptly recorded his deed. The farmer had heard that the landowner previously sold the land to a different buyer, but he was sure that the landowner would not sell him property she had already sold to someone else. Six months later, the buyer returned to the land and found the farmer there. A statute of the jurisdiction in which the land is located provides: "No conveyance or mortgage of an interest in land is valid against any subsequent purchaser for value without notice thereof whose conveyance is first recorded." The buyer now sues the farmer in ejectment. Who owns the land?
2312	Congress has enacted a statute that requires all companies engaging in business with the federal government to enact certain affirmative action programs in hiring. A small diner has been providing catering services for a local branch office of the United States Department of Agriculture. At lunch one day, a senior enforcement officer of the Department of Agriculture happens to notice the racial makeup of the diner's workforce, and informs the diner that it is in violation of the affirmative action statute, and files charges against the diner. If the diner challenges the validity of the federal statute, what is the government's best response to the argument that Congress has exceeded its legitimate powers?
2313	Fran, who was driving at an excessive speed, applied her brakes to stop at a traffic light. Due to damp, fallen leaves, her car skidded and came to a halt perpendicular to the roadway. Sid, who was also driving at an excessive speed and was immediately behind Fran, saw Fran's car perpendicular to the roadway. Although Sid had sufficient distance to come to a slow, controlled stop, he decided not to slow down but, rather, to swerve to the left in an effort to go around Fran's car. Due to oncoming traffic, the space was insufficient and Sid's car collided with Fran's car, severely injuring Fran. Fran filed a personal injury action against Sid in a jurisdiction in which contributory negligence is a bar to recovery. Will Fran prevail?
2314	During the defendant's trial for assault and battery, he called to the stand a witness to testify that the victim was the aggressor and the defendant was acting in self-defense. During crossexamination, the prosecution asked the witness if he embezzled funds from his employer five years ago. The witness denied any such activity, and in rebuttal the prosecution seeks to call to the stand the witness's former employer to testify that the witness did in fact embezzle funds during the employment. The defense objects to the testimony. Should the court sustain the objection?
2315	Congress passes an act requiring that all owners of bicycles in the United States register them with a federal bicycle registry. The purpose of the law is to provide reliable evidence of ownership to reduce bicycle theft. No fee is charged for the registration. Although most stolen bicycles are kept or resold by the thieves in the same cities in which the bicycles were stolen, an increasing number of bicycles are being taken to cities in other states for resale. Is this act of Congress constitutional?
2316	While on routine patrol late one night, a police officer noticed that a car was weaving recklessly across several lanes of traffic. He stopped the driver, believing that he was driving while intoxicated. By state law, the officer was empowered to arrest the driver and take him to the nearest police station for booking. As he approached the vehicle, the officer saw the driver put what appeared to be a bottle in the glove compartment. The officer arrested the driver and then searched his vehicle. In the glove compartment, the officer discovered a vial containing a small amount of cocaine. The driver was charged with possession of cocaine. At a preliminary hearing, the driver's attorney moves to prevent introduction of the cocaine into evidence on the grounds that the search violated his client's federal constitutional rights. This motion will most likely be:
2317	Dalton is on trial for burglary. During crossexamination of Dalton, the prosecutor wants to inquire about Dalton's earlier conviction for falsifying a credit application. Which of the following facts concerning the conviction would be the best reason for the trial court's refusing to allow such examination?
2318	Because of Farmer's default on his loan, the bank foreclosed on the farm and equipment that secured the loan. Among the items sold at the resulting auction was a new tractor recently delivered to Farmer by the retailer. Shortly after purchasing the tractor at the auction, Pratt was negligently operating the tractor on a hill when it rolled over due to a defect in the tractor's design. He was injured as a result. Pratt sued the auctioneer, alleging strict liability in tort. The jurisdiction has not adopted a comparative fault rule in strict liability cases. In this suit, the result should be for the
2319	John Smith has denied his purported signature on a letter which has become critical in a breach of contract suit between Smith and Miller. At trial, Miller's counsel calls Alice, a teacher, who testifies that she taught John Smith mathematics in school ten years earlier, knows his signature, and proposes to testify that the signature to the letter is that of John Smith. Smith's counsel objects. The trialjudge should
2320	A local news station broadcast a live interview with a bystander about his views concerning the state of local education. The bystander responded by saying that the principal of his daughter's high school had been embezzling school funds for years. The principal saw the telecast and also recorded it. He sued the owner of the station for defamation. At trial, the principal sought to testify to the defamatory statement made in the interview. The principal's testimony will most likely be held to be:
2321	A bank sold one of its mortgages and the accompanying note to a finance company. Shortly thereafter, the finance company sold both the mortgage and the note to a brokerage firm. The brokerage firm duly recorded the assignment in the offices of the county recorder of deeds, as prescribed by state statute. However, the brokerage firm decided to use the finance company as its collection agent for the payments as they came due. Therefore, the brokerage firm left the mortgage and note documents in the hands of the finance company. The finance company developed cash-flow and liquidity problems. To try to save the, finance company from bankruptcy, its president sold the mortgage and accompanying note to an investor. This transaction was not enough to save the finance company from insolvency. During the winding up of the finance company's affairs, the brokerage firm discovered the finance company's sale of the mortgage and note to the investor. The brokerage firm also learned that the finance company never told the investor about the brokerage firm's interests in the mortgage and note. The brokerage firm files suit against the investor for the return of the mortgage and note. The court will decide that:
2322	A 17-year-old boy walked into a medical clinic and requested assistance with a deep cut he received when he fell off his bike. The doctor told the boy that if he agreed to work at the clinic for 45 hours a week for four weeks, he would stitch the wound and apply a medicated bandage. The clinic typically charges $225 for such treatment. Although it seemed like a lot of work for $225, the boy needed immediate medical attention, so he accepted the offer and promised to report for work the next day, after which the doctor treated the boy's injury. On his way home from the clinic, the medicated bandage fell into a ditch and was lost for good. The boy refused to report for work the next day. If the medical clinic sues the boy for $225 and loses, it will be because:
2323	While hospitalized, Marsh requested her attorney to draw a deed conveying her home to her son, Simon. While Marsh remained in the hospital, the deed was drawn, properly executed, and promptly and properly recorded. On being informed of the existence of the deed, Simon told his mother, "I want no part of the property; take the deed right back." Marsh recovered and left the hospital, but shortly thereafter, before any other relevant event, Simon died intestate. Marsh brought an appropriate action against Simon's heirs to determine title. If Marsh wins, it will be because
2324	A patient suffering from a life-threatening blood disorder could be saved only by undergoing a new treatment only offered by a physician in another city. It was therefore arranged that the patient would fly to the city where the physician would perform the treatment. The day before the patient was to leave, his sole heir, who stood to inherit from him, poisoned him. The poison produced a reaction that required postponement of the journey. Meanwhile, the plane on which the patient was to have flown crashed and all aboard were killed. The next day the patient died from the combined effects of the poison and the blood disorder. His heir was arrested and charged with criminal homicide. The heir should be found:
2325	Seth was an elderly widower who lived alone on a small farm which he owned. Except for the farm, including the house and its furnishings, and the usual items of personal clothing and similar things, Seth owned substantially no property. Under proper management, the farm was capable of producing an adequate family income. Because of the usual deterioration accompanying old age, Seth was unable to do farm work or even to provide for his own personal needs. Seth entered into an oral contract with his nephew, Jim, by which Seth agreed to convey the farm to Jim and Jim agreed to move into the house with Seth, operate the farm, and take care of Seth for the rest of his life. The oral contract was silent as to when the land was to be conveyed. Jim, who lived about fifty miles away where he was operating a small business of his own, terminated his business and moved in with Seth. With the assistance of his wife, Jim gave Seth excellent care until Seth died intestate about five years after the date of the contract. In his final years Seth was confined to his bed and required much personal service of an intimate and arduous sort. Seth was survived by his only son, Sol, who was also Seth's sole heir and next of kin. Sol resided in a distant city and gave his father no attention in his father's final years. Sol showed up for Seth's funeral and demanded that Jim vacate the farm immediately. Upon Jim's refusal to do so, Sol brought an appropriate action for possession. Jim answered by way of a counterclaim to establish Jim's right to possession and title to the farm. If the court 's decision is in favor of Jim, it will be because
2326	A pregnant woman wished to obtain an abortion, but she was poor and could not afford one. Her home state did not provide financial assistance for abortions, but a neighboring state did for women who had been living within the state for at least three months prior to the procedure. The woman went to see a doctor in the neighboring state. He told her of the residency requirement. He also told the woman that he thought the residency requirement was unconstitutional and suggested that the woman bring an action in federal court challenging the residency requirement. She complied, bringing an action in forma pauperis, naming the doctor as the only defendant. The doctor responded that he believed that the requirement was unconstitutional and would like to be able to perform the abortion for the woman. The court should:
2327	Phillips purchased a suit of thermal underwear manufactured by Makorp from synthetic materials. While he was attempting to stamp out a fire, Phillips' thermal underwear caught fire and burned in a melting fashion up to his waist. He suffered a heart attack a half hour later. In a suit against Makorp, Phillips alleged that negligence and breach of warranty caused both the burn and the heart attack. Phillips testified to the fpregoing. Dr. Jones, a physician, having listened to Phillips' testimony, is called by Phillips and asked whether, assuming the truth of such testimony, Phillips' subsequent heart attack could have resulted from the burns. His opinion is
2328	Anders conveyed her only parcel of land to Burton by a duly executed and delivered warranty deed, which provided: To have and to hold the described tract of land in fee simple, subject to the understanding that within one year from the date of the instrument said grantee shall construct and thereafter maintain and operate on said premises a public health center. The grantee, Burton, constructed a public health center on the tract within the time specified and operated it for five years. At the end of this period' Burton converted the structure into a senior citizens' recreational facility. It is conceded by all parties in interest that a senior citizens' recreational facility is not a public health center. In an appropriate action, Anders seeks a declaration that the change in the use of the facility has caused the land and structure to revert to her. In this action, Anders should
2329	In a jurisdiction without a Dead Man's Statute, Parker's estate sued Davidson claiming that Davidson had borrowed from Parker $10,000, which had not been repaid as of Parker's death. Parker was run over by a truck. At the accident scene, while dying from massive injuries, Parker told Officer Smith to "make sure my estate collects the $10,000 I loaned to Davidson." Smith's testimony about Parker's statement is
2330	In a federal court diversity action by Plant against Decord on an insurance claim, a question arose whether the court should apply a presumption that, where both husband and wife were killed in a common accident, the husband died last. Whether this presumption should be applied is to be determined according to
2331	The police in City notified local gas station attendants that a woman, known as Robber, recently had committed armed robberies at five City gas stations. The police said that Robber was approximately 75 years old, had white hair, and drove a vintage, cream-colored Ford Thunderbird. Attendants were advised to call police if they saw her, but not to attempt to apprehend her. Armed robbery is a felony under state law. Traveler was passing through City on a cross- country journey. Traveler was a 75-year- old woman who had white hair and drove a vintage, cream-colored Ford Thunderbird. When Traveler drove into Owner's gas station, Owner thought Traveler must be the robber wanted by the police. After checking the oil at Traveler's request, Owner falsely informed Traveler that she had a broken fan belt, that her car could not be driven without a new belt, that it would take him about an hour to replace it, and that she should stay in his office for consultation about the repair. Traveler was greatly annoyed that her journey was delayed, but she stayed in Owner's office while she waited for her car. Owner telephoned the police and, within the hour, the police came and questioned Traveler. The police immediately determined that Traveler was not Robber, and Traveler resumed her journey without further delay. In Traveler's action for false imprisonment against Owner, Traveler will
2332	Park sued Davis Co. for injuries suffered in the crash of Park's dune buggy, allegedly caused by a defective auto part manufactured by Davis Co.

2333	Congress adopted a law granting a state university $2.5 million to study the properties of snowflakes. An outraged taxpayer filed suit to challenge the appropriation. Which of the following is the best argument against this challenge?
2334	On October 22, Officer Jones submitted an application for a warrant to search 217 Elm Street for cocaine. In the application, Officer Jones stated under oath that he believed there was cocaine at that location because of information supplied to him on the morning of October 22 by Susie Schultz. He described Schultz as a cocaine user who had previously supplied accurate information concerning the use of cocaine in the community and summarized what Schultz had told him as follows: the previous night, October 21, Schultz was in Robert Redd's house at 217 Elm Street. Redd gave her cocaine. She also saw three cellophane bags containing cocaine in his bedroom. The warrant was issued and a search of 217 Elm Street was conducted on October 22. The search turned up a quantity of marijuana but no cocaine. Robert Redd was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana. Redd moved to suppress the use of the marijuana as evidence contending that Susie Schultz was not in 217 Elm Street on October 21 or at any other time. If, after hearing evidence, the judge concludes that the statement in the application attributed to Susie Schultz is incorrect, the judge should grant the motion to suppress
2335	A plaintiff brought a lawsuit against a department store for injuries she suffered while riding an escalator that accelerated and then came to a sudden stop. At trial, a witness is prepared to testify for the plaintiff that he heard another customer tell the store manager the day before the plaintiff was injured that the escalator was speeding up and stopping without warning. The customer still lives in the area but she has not been called to testify. Should the court admit the witness's testimony?
2336	Lester was engaged to marry Sylvia. One evening, Lester became enraged at the comments of Sylvia's eight-year-old daughter, Cynthia, who was complaining, in her usual fashion, that she did not want her mother to marry Lester. Lester, who had had too much to drink, began beating her. Cynthia suffered some bruises and a broken arm. Sylvia took Cynthia to the hospital. The police were notified by the hospital staff. Lester was indicted for felony child abuse. Lester pleaded with Sylvia to forgive him and to run away with him. She agreed. They moved out of state and took Cynthia with them. Without the testimony of the child, the prosecution was forced to dismiss the case. Some time later, Sylvia returned for a visit with her family and was arrested and indicted as an accessory-after-the-fact to child abuse. At her trial, the court should
2337	A defendant is on trial for murder. The only evidence linking the defendant to the crime is some blood found at the scene. The lead detective testifies that an officer took a vial containing a blood sample that had been retrieved by a crime scene technician and drove off with it. The officer is now dead. Next, the prosecution presents as a witness a crime lab chemist. The chemist will testify that he took a vial of blood that contained a label identifying it as having been retrieved from the subject crime scene, and that he performed tests that established a match between that blood and a blood sample taken from the defendant. The testimony of the chemist is:
2338	Furrow leased in writing a 100-acre farm from Quark for five years at $2,000 per year, with an option to purchase "five acres of the land for $10,000 cash" at the end of the lease term. Before the lease was executed, Quark orally promised to have a five-acre parcel surveyed before the end of the lease term. Furrow took possession of the farm and paid the rent for five years. During the fifth year, having decided that he would exercise the purchase option, Furrow planted several fruit trees and built a large grain silo on the property. At the end of the term, Furrow tendered Quark $10,000 and demanded a conveyance, but Quark repudiated the option agreement and retook possession of the farm. He had never had the five-acre parcel surveyed. In an action by Furrow against Quark for specific performance of the option agreement, which of the following is Quark's best defense?
2339	After the dictator of a Caribbean island country was deposed, the President of the United States extended official recognition to the country's new government. As ambassador to the newly recognized government, the President nominated an aging industrialist who was a close personal friend of the deposed dictator. Unable to muster enough votes to block approval of the new ambassador, the President's political opponents in the Senate caused a resolution to be passed requiring that all consular staff below the rank of ambassador be selected from a list of "approved" candidates who have been certified as acceptable by the new country's government. The President refused to consider any of the Senate's list of approved candidates. Which of the following is the President's strongest constitutional basis for refusing to obey the Senate resolution?
2340	A plaintiff sued a defendant for defamation, asserting in her complaint that the defendant had called the plaintiff a thief in front of a number of business associates. The plaintiff calls two witnesses to the stand, both of whom testify that they heard the defendant refer to the plaintiff as a thief in front of the business associates. The plaintiff does not take the stand herself. The defendant pleads truth of the statement as an affirmative defense and calls a witness to the stand. The defense witness is prepared to testify that he was a co-worker of the plaintiff when the plaintiff supplemented her income by tending bar three nights a week. The witness will testify that he saw the plaintiff take a $20 bill from the tavern's cash register and secrete the money in her pocket. The plaintiff's attorney objects. May the defense witness's testimony be allowed?
2341	To encourage economic development in areas of a state currently underdeveloped, state legislation created an agency to build retail buildings in those parts of the state and then to sell the stores to buyers at the cost of materials and labor. The federal government has enacted legislation in effect for the relevant period that regulates the manner in which building contractors conduct business. Is the state agency subject to these federal regulations?
2342	The president of a private college received a report that there was a great deal of cocaine use occurring on the second floor of the dormitory. The president persuaded the school security officers to place several concealed microphones in the second-floor student lounge. Conversations occurring in the lounge were monitored by the security officers and they recorded a conversation in which a sophomore at the college offered to sell cocaine to a freshman. A tape of the conversation was taken to the local police, who played it for a local judge. The judge issued a warrant to search the sophomore's room. While searching the room the police discovered a large amount of cocaine and the sophomore was arrested and charged with unlawful possession of narcotics. His attorney moved to prevent the introduction of the cocaine into evidence. The motion will most likely be:
2343	A former employee and his friend agreed to rob a grocery store. They entered the store just before closing. The former employee held a gun on the store manager and made him empty out the safe, and the friend directed a clerk who was the only other person in the store to a storeroom in the back. Before tying her up, however, the friend raped her at gunpoint. The friend returned to the front of the store, where the former employee had just finished putting the store's money in a large sack. To prevent the store manager from pursuing the pair or from quickly notifying the police, the friend shot the store manager in both knees. Neither the rape nor the shooting were part of the plan between the former employee and the friend. In a common law jurisdiction, of which of the following crimes is the former employee guilty?
2344	An investor owned a large tract of land. To the east of the land was a city-owned parking lot. The investor used a driveway across the eastern part of the land to provide the western part with access to the parking lot. Subsequently, the investor sold the western parcel to a bakery and the eastern parcel to a coffee shop. By a written instrument, the coffee shop granted the bakery and its customers the right to use the driveway to access the parking lot. The only other way to enter the parking lot is over land to the north of the western parcel. The bakery has been unsuccessful in obtaining access to the parking lot over this land. The bakery's right to use the driveway is:
2345	On January 1, a car salesman offered to sell an antique car to a collector for $35,000 cash on delivery. The collector paid the car salesman $100 to hold the offer open for a period of 25 days. On January 4, the collector called the car salesman and left a message on his answering machine, asking him whether he would consider lowering the price to $30,000. The car salesman played back the message the same day but did not reply. On January 9, the collector wrote the car salesman a letter, telling him that he could not pay more than $30,000 for the antique car, and that if the car salesman would not accept that amount, he would not go through with the deal. The car salesman received this letter on January 10 and again he did not reply. The car salesman never heard from the collector again. The offer that the car salesman made to the collector on January 1 terminated:
2346	The legislature of the state of Gray recently enacted a statute forbidding public utilities regulated by the Gray Public Service Commission to increase their rates more than once every two years. Economy Electric Power Company, a public utility regulated by that commission, has just obtained approval of the commission for a general rate increase. Economy Electric has routinely filed for a rate increase every ten to 14 months during the last 20 years. Because of uncertainties about future fuel prices, the power company cannot ascertain with any certainty the date when it will need a further rate increase; but it thinks it may need such an increase sometime within the next 18 months. Economy Electric files an action in the federal district court in Gray requesting a declaratory judgment that this new statute of Gray forbidding public utility rate increases more often than once every two years is unconstitutional. Assume no federal statute is relevant. In this case, the court should
2347	A husband and wife were charged with stealing credit cards and charging expensive items on the misappropriated cards. An attorney was appointed by the court to represent the couple jointly. At the preliminary hearing, the judge found that the attorney would have no conflict representing both defendants in the joint trial. Halfway through the trial, however, a conflict arose between the defenses of the husband and wife. At the wife's request, the attorney moved that another attorney be appointed to represent the wife and that a mistrial be declared. The trial judge moved favorably on the attorney's motion. Another attorney was appointed to represent the wife, and as soon as the wife's trial began, her attorney moved to dismiss the case on the ground that jeopardy had attached during the wife's first trial and that she was being retried in violation of the United States Constitution. Should the judge grant the wife's attorney's motion?
2348	Owen owned Greenacre in fee simple. The small house on Greenacre was occupied, with Owen's oral permission, rent-free, by Able, Owen's son, and Baker, a college classmate of Able. Able was then 21 years old. Owen, by properly executed instrument, conveyed Greenacre to "my beloved son, Able, his heirs and assigns, upon the condition precedent that he earn a college degree by the time he reaches the age of 30. If, for any reason, he does not meet this condition, then Greenacre shall become the sole property of my beloved daughter, Anna, her heirs and assigns." At the time of the conveyance, Able and Baker attended a college located several blocks from Greenacre. Neither had earned a college degree. One week after the delivery of the deed to Able, Able recorded the deed and immediately told Baker that he, Able, was going to begin charging Baker rent since "I am now your landlord." There is no applicable statute. Able and Baker did not reach agreement, and Able served the appropriate notice to terminate whatever tenancy Baker had. Able then sought, in an appropriate action, to oust Baker. Who should prevail?
2349	John was fired from his job. Too proud to apply for unemployment benefits, he used his savings to feed his family. When one of his children became ill, he did not seek medical attention for the child at a state clinic because he did not want to accept what he regarded as charity. Eventually, weakened by malnutrition, the child died as a result of the illness. John has committed
2350	A federal statute enacted pursuant to the powers of Congress to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment and to regulate commerce among the states prohibits any state from requiring any of its employees to retire from state employment solely because of their age. The statute expressly authorizes employees required by a state to retire from state employment solely because of their age to sue the state government in federal district court for any damages resulting from that state action. On the basis of this federal statute, Retiree sues State X in federal district court. State X moves to dismiss the suit on the ground that Congress lacks authority to authorize such suits against a state. Which of the following is the strongest argument that Retiree can offer in opposition to the state's motion to dismiss this suit?
2351	A breeder of quarter horses entered into an agreement with a rancher to sell and deliver two quarter horses, one to the rancher and the other to the rancher's fiance as a gift. Although the fair market value of each horse was $3,000, the horse breeder agreed to sell both horses together for a total price of $5,000. Under the agreement that the rancher wrote out and both parties signed, the horse breeder agreed to deliver one horse to the rancher on August 1, at which time the rancher agreed to pay the horse breeder $5,000. The horse breeder further agreed to deliver the other horse to the rancher's fiance on August 12. On August 1, the horse breeder delivered the first horse to the rancher and, at the same time, the rancher gave the horse breeder a certified check for $5,000. On August 12, the horse breeder brought the second horse to the residence of the rancher's fiancee and told her that the horse was a gift from the rancher. The rancher's fiance told the horse breeder that she loathed quarter horses and she refused to take the horse. The horse breeder brought this horse back to his farm and sent an e-mail to the rancher, informing him that his fiance refused delivery and that he (the horse breeder) could not keep the horse. Two weeks later, after not hearing from the rancher, the horse breeder sold the horse to an interested party for $3,000. If the rancher sues the horse breeder, he should recover:
2352	An electric company is the sole distributor of electrical power in the city. The company owns and maintains all of the electric poles and equipment in the city in compliance with government standards. The electric company has had to replace insulators on its poles repeatedly because unknown persons regularly shoot at and destroy them, which causes the power lines to fall to the ground. On one of these occasions, a fiveyear-old child who had wandered out of his yard intentionally touched a downed wire, and was seriously burned. If a claim on the child's behalf is asserted against the electric company, the probable result is that the child will:
2353	A landlord leased a house to a tenant for five years. Under the terms of the lease, the tenant was to pay a fixed monthly rent plus all taxes and reasonable maintenance charges for the upkeep of the house. Three years into the lease, the tenant assigned her lease to a friend by written agreement. Although the tenant properly set forth the terms concerning the rent and maintenance charges, she failed to properly state that the friend was liable to pay the taxes on the residence during the period of the lease. A year later, the landlord received notice that a tax lien would be placed on the residence unless the taxes were immediately paid. The landlord paid the taxes and brought suit against the tenant's friend for the amount. The suit extremely upset the friend, who abandoned the residence. Can the landlord successfully bring a suit against the tenant for this breach of the lease?
2354	The defendant is being tried for murder in the bludgeoning death of his brother. The defendant denies any involvement in the crime. He calls a witness to the stand, who testifies that, in his opinion, the defendant is a nonviolent, peaceable man. Which of the following, if offered by the prosecution, would most likely be admissible?
2355	For this question only, assume that on January 15, having at that time received no reply from Lawyer, Stationer notified Lawyer that effective February 1, it was increasing the prices of certain specified items in its catalog. Is the price increase effective with respect to catalog orders Stationer receives from Lawyer during the month of February?
2356	An owner of land gave his friend a deed for a specified parcel of property. After the owner's death, the friend discovered that the owner had sold part of the property. The purchaser had been given an easement to cross over the owner's property to get to the property she had purchased, although there is no evidence that the purchaser had ever used the "right of way." If the purchaser does have the right of way over the property the owner gave to his friend, the owner's estate would be liable for breach of the covenant:
2357	BCD, a manufacturer of computers, pays its salespeople a salary of $1,000 per month and a commission of 5% on billings actually rendered for machines that they sell. BCD salespeople are employed at will under written agreements which provide that in order to receive a commission the salesperson must be in the employment of the company when the bill is sent to the customer. In 1976, John, a salesperson for BCD, worked for eight months to get an order from Bobb Corporation for a large $750,000 computer. He consulted extensively with Bobb's top executives and worked with its operating personnel to dt.velop detailed specifications for the new equipment. He also promised Bobb, with BCD's knowledge and approval, to assist Bobb for six months after installation in making the equipment work. On January 1, 1977, Bobb signed an order, and on March 1 the computer was installed. On March 15, BCD fired John on the stated ground that he had failed to meet his 1975 and 1976 sales quotas. John thought that BCD was correct in this statement. Another salesperson, Franklin, was thereupon assigned to service the Bobb account. On March 31, BCD billed Bobb for the computer. Which of the following additional facts, if shown by the evidence, would support a claim by John against BCD ? 1. BCD terminated John because Franklin is the son of the company's president, who wanted his son to have the commission instead of John. II. BCD and John were mistaken; John had in fact exceeded his sales quotas for 1975 and 1976. III. John had worked for BCD as a salesperson for 20 years.
2358	The owner of a custom jewelry supply shop placed an order with a manufacturer for 500 pairs of sterling silver "posts" of the type that are used to make pierced earrings. However, when the manufacturer started to fill the order, it had only 450 pairs of sterling silver posts available. The manufacturer shipped the 450 pairs of sterling silver posts to the shop owner, plus 50 pairs of higher-priced 10-karat gold posts, without making any adjustment in price. The manufacturer enclosed a note with the order, explaining to the shop owner that it was sending the last of the sterling silver posts in stock, plus the 50 10-karat gold posts to accommodate the buyer. Did the manufacturer's shipment constitute an acceptance of the shop owner's offer?
2359	Plaintiff sued Defendant for breach of a commercial contract in which Defendant had agreed to sell Plaintiff all of Plaintiffs requirements for widgets. Plaintiff called Expert Witness to testify as to damages. Defendant seeks to show that Expert Witness had provided false testimony as a witness in his own divorce proceedings. This evidence should be
2360	In an effort to protect the dwindling California condor population, Congress enacted the Condor Preservation Act, which made it illegal to take, possess, or sell any part of a California condor. The constitutionality of the Act is challenged by a seller of gifts and artifacts, including artifacts made out of California condor feathers. Is the statute valid?
2361	Congress created a tribunal by statute, which was empowered to review claims made by clients of a federal agency and make recommendations to the agency regarding their merits. A lawyer was properly appointed to the tribunal. Six years later, the tribunal was abolished by repeal of the authorizing legislation, and the lawyer was offered an administrative position in the transportation department at a lower salary. The lawyer brought an action against the federal government on the grounds that Congress may not remove a federal judge from office during good behavior, nor decrease his salary during continuance in office. Counsel for the government made a motion to dismiss. The trial court should rule:
2362	House owns his home in City. On the lawn in front of his home and within five feet of the public sidewalk, there was a large tree. The roots of the tree caused the sidewalk to buckle severely and become dangerous. An ordinance of City requires adjacent landowners to keep sidewalks in safe condition. House engaged Contractor to repair the sidewalk, leaving it to Contractor to decide how the repair should be made. Contractor dug up the sidewalk, cut back the roots of the tree, and laid a new sidewalk. Two days after House had paid Contractor the agreed price of the repair, the tree fell over onto the street and damaged a parked car belonging to Driver. Driver has asserted claims against House and Contractor, and both defendants admit that cutting the roots caused the tree to fall. If Driver recovers a judgment against House, does House have any recourse against Contractor?
2363	Alpha and Beta owned Greenacre, a large farm, in fee simple as tenants in common, each owning an undivided one-half interest. For five years Alpha occupied Greenacre and conducted farming operations. Alpha never accounted to Beta for any income but Alpha did pay all real estate taxes when the taxes were due and kept the buildings located on Greenacre insured against loss from fire, storm, and flood. Beta lived in a distant city and was interested only in realizing a profit from the sale of the land when market conditions produced the price Beta wanted. Alpha died intestate survived by Hera, Alpha's sole heir. Thereafter Hera occupied Greenacre but was inexperienced in farming operations. The result was a financial disaster. Hera failed to pay real estate taxes for two years. The appropriate governmental authority held a tax sale to recover the taxes due. At such sale Beta was the only bidder and obtained a conveyance from the appropriate governmental authority upon payment of an amount sufficient to discharge the amounts due for taxes, plus interest and penalties, and the costs of holding the tax sale. The amount paid was one-third of the reasonable market value of Greenacre. Thereafter Beta instituted an appropriate action against Hera to quiet title in and to recover possession of Greenacre. Hera asserted all defenses available to Hera. Except for the statutes related to real estate taxes and tax sales, there is no applicable statute. In this lawsuit, Beta is entitled to a decree quieting title so that Beta is the sole owner in fee simple of Greenacre
2364	Congress enacted a statute providing grants of federal funds for the restoration and preservation of courthouses that were built before 1900 and are still in use. The statute contains an inseverable condition requiring that any courthouse restored with the aid of such a grant must be equipped with ramps and other facilities necessary to accommodate physically handicapped people. A law of the state of Blue requires public buildings in Blue to have ramps and other facilities for handicapped people. It exempts from those requirements any building that is more than 70 years old if the State Board of Architects finds that the installation of such facilities would destroy the architectural integrity of the building. The Red County Courthouse in the state of Blue was built in 1895 and is still in use. It does not contain ramps or other special facilities for handicapped people. The State Board of Architects has determined that the installation of those facilities would destroy the architectural integrity of the building. Nevertheless, the County Board of Red County applies for a federal grant to restore and preserve that county's courthouse. If the County Board of Red County restores the Red County Courthouse with the aid of a federal restoration and preservation grant, is the board bound to install ramps and other facilities for handicapped people in that building?
2365	The accused and an accomplice decided to burglarize a home. They agreed that the crime would be committed the following Saturday night. On Thursday, the accused shoplifted a crowbar from a department store, figuring he could use it for future crimes. On Friday, the accused was arrested and jailed for an unrelated crime. He was confined over the weekend. His accomplice decided to go ahead with the burglary. On Saturday night, as he was about to break open the front door to the home, he was arrested by a passing police officer. Of which crimes, in a common law jurisdiction, is the accused guilty?
