0	The director of a one-person field station of the United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA") in a small town was instructed by his superiors to sell surplus government cheese and butter to local low income residents at 10% of market value. All sales were conducted at the USDA warehouse next to the field station. Pursuant to state statutes allowing municipal governments to establish reasonable regulations governing the retail sale of foodstuffs, the town in which the field office is located requires any establishment for the retail sale of food to pass a health and sanitation inspection and meet other specified criteria for obtaining a city license. The director of the field office failed to obtain a license from the town and was prosecuted for the failure. Which of the following will provide the best defense for the director in this prosecution?
1	Passenger departed on an ocean liner knowing that it would be a rough voyage due to predicted storms. The ocean liner was not equipped with the type of lifeboats required by the applicable statute. Passenger was swept overboard and drowned in a storm so heavy that even a lifeboat that conformed to the statute could not have been launched. In an action against the operator of the ocean liner brought by Passenger's representative, will Passenger's representative prevail?
2	A city ordinance prohibits the distribution of pamphlets "on public sidewalks or other public areas when foot traffic is sufficiently heavy and the manner of distribution of the pamphlets causes obstruction of the foot traffic so as to result in spillover onto public streets where vehicular traffic creates a danger to human life." The state fair is held at fairgrounds whose entrances lie along a busy multilane street. A demonstrator was distributing pamphlets advocating repeal of the federal milk price support program at the state fair. He attracted a crowd of about 10 farmers and children outside the fairgrounds entrance at which he stood, but most of the few fairgoers entering the fair at that late afternoon time simply ignored him. When one of the dairy farmers became irate and threatened to "knock his block off," the demonstrator was arrested by a fair security guard and subsequently prosecuted under the city ordinance. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the city ordinance and the demonstrator's prosecution?
3	Miller is tried for armed robbery of the First Bank of City. The prosecutor offers the testimony of a bartender that when he saw the money in Miller's wallet, he said, "You must have robbed a bank," to which Miller made no reply. This evidence is
4	Logging has long been one of the major industries of a state. To protect the logging industry, which was being harmed by the too rapid depletion of the wood in the forests of the state, and to promote the general welfare of the state's citizens, the state legislature enacted statutes for the first time requiring licenses for commercial logging. To receive a license, the applicant must pay a $500 fee and establish by acceptable evidence that he has been engaged in commercial logging in the forests of the state for the past 15 years. A limited number of special licenses are available for those who do not meet the requirements of the regular licenses, and these special licenses are expressly reserved for citizens who have resided in the state for at least three years prior to the date of the application. A legally admitted alien who has been residing in the state for 10 years brings suit in federal court to enjoin enforcement of the licensing statute as to himself and all other similarly situated noncitizen legal residents of the state. Which of the following doctrines will probably be determinative of his claims?
5	The police suspected that Yancey, a 16-year-old high school student, had committed a series of burglaries. Two officers went to Yancey's high school and asked the principal to call Yancey out of class and to search his backpack. While the officers waited, the principal took Yancey into the hall where she asked to look in his backpack. When Yancey refused, the principal grabbed it from him, injuring Yancey's shoulder in the process. In the backpack, she found jewelry that she turned over to the officers. The officers believed that the jewelry had been taken in one of the burglaries. They arrested Yancey, took him to the station, and gave him Miranda warnings. Yancey asked to see a lawyer. The police called Yancey's parents to the station. When Yancey's parents arrived, the police asked them to speak with Yancey. They put them in a room and secretly recorded their conversation with a concealed electronic device. Yancey broke down and confessed to his parents that he had committed the burglaries. Yancey was charged with the burglaries. Yancey moves to suppress the use of the jewelry. The court should
6	Ogden was the fee simple owner of three adjoining vacant lots fronting on a common street in a primarily residential section of a city which had no zoning laws. The lots were identified as Lots 1, 2, and 3. Ogden conveyed Lot 1 to Akers and Lot 2 to Bell. Ogden retained Lot 3, which consisted of three acres of woodland. Bell, whose lot was between the other two, built a house on his lot. Bell's house included a large window on the side facing Lot 3. The window provided a beautiful view from Bell's living room, thereby adding value to Bell's house. Akers erected a house on his lot. Ogden made no complaint to either Akers or Bell concerning the houses they built. After both Akers and Bell had completed their houses, the two of them agreed to and did build a common driveway running from the street to the rear of their respective lots. The driveway was built on the line between the two houses so that one-half of the way was located on each lot. Akers and Bell exchanged right-ofway deeds by which each of them conveyed to the other, his heirs and assigns, an easement to continue the right of way. Both deeds were properly recorded. After Akers and Bell had lived in their respective houses for thirty years, a new public street was built bordering on the rear of Lots 1, 2, and 3. Akers informed Bell that, since the new street removed the need for their common driveway, he considered the right-of-way terminated; therefore, he intended to discontinue its use and expected Bell to do the same. At about the same time, Ogden began the erection of a six-story apartment house on Lot 3. If the apartment house is completed, it will block the view from Bell's window and will substantially reduce the value of Bell's lot. In an action brought by Bell to enjoin Ogden from erecting the apartment building in such a way as to obstruct the view from Bell's livingroom window, the decision should be for
7	An artist was on trial for burglary, defined in the jurisdiction as breaking and entering the dwelling of another with the intent to commit a felony. The artist's defense was that he was merely retrieving his own property, because he had sold a painting to a customer but the customer had refused to pay him for it or return it. A neighbor of the customer testified for the prosecution that he saw the artist carrying a painting from the customer's house. The artist attempts to call to the stand a witness who was in the gallery at the time of the sale to testify to the transaction between the artist and the customer. The prosecution objects to the testimony, claiming it is irrelevant. The judge should rule that the witness's testimony is:
8	A landowner and a purchaser orally agreed that the landowner would convey 20 acres of his 160-acre farm to the purchaser. At the time of their agreement, the landowner wrote on the back of an envelope, "I hereby promise to convey the northern 20 acres of my farm to [the purchaser] for $10,000." One month later, the purchaser tendered $10,000 to the landowner, but the landowner refused to convey the 20 acres. If the purchaser sues the landowner to convey the land and the landowner prevails, it will most likely be because the writing:
9	A state set up an intrastate message routing system to carry messages to and from the various state agency offices located throughout the state. This proved to be cheaper and more efficient than the United States Postal Service. The message service worked so well that the state offered the messenger service to its employees as a fringe benefit. Moreover, it expanded delivery options beyond state offices to any address in the state and permitted the employees to use the service for personal correspondence as well as for official business. Are the state's actions constitutional?
10	Henry hated Wanda, his former wife, for divorcing him and marrying John a short time thereafter. About a month after Wanda married John. Henry secretly entered Wanda and John's rented apartment during their absence by using a master key. Henry placed a microphone behind the bookstand in the bedroom of the apartment, drilled a hole in the nearby wall and poked the wires from the microphone through the hole into the space in the wall, with the result that the microphone appeared to be connected with wires going into the adjoining apartment. Actually, the microphone was not connected to anything. Henry anticipated that Wanda would discover the microphone in a few days and would be upset by the thought that someone had been listening to her conversations with John in their bedroom. Shortly thereafter, as he was putting a book on the stand, John noticed the wires behind the bookstand and discovered the hidden microphone. He then called Wanda and showed her the microphone and wires. Wanda fainted and, in falling, struck her head on the bookstand and suffered a mild concussion. The next day John telephone Henry and accused him of planting the microphone. Henry laughingly admitted it. Because of his concern about Wanda and his anger at Henry, John is emotionally upset and unable to go to work. If Wanda asserts a claim against Henry based on infliction of mental distress, the fact that John was the person who showed her the microphone will
11	On March 1, Computer Programs, Inc. (CP) orally agreed with Holiday Department Store (HDS) to write a set of programs for HDS's computer and to coordinate the programs with HDS's billing methods. A subsequent memo, signed by both parties, provided in its entirety: HDS will pay CP $20,000 in two equal installments within one month of completion if CP is successful in shortening by one-half the processing time for the financial transactions now handled on HDS's Zenon 747 computer; CP to complete by July 1. This agreement may be amended only by a signed writing. On June 6, CP demanded $10,000, saying the job was one-half done. After HDS denied liability, the parties orally agreed that HDS should deposit $20,000 in escrow, pending completion to the satisfaction of HDS's computer systems manager. The escrow deposit was thereupon made. On July 5, CP completed the programs, having used an amount of time in which it could have earned $18,000 had it devoted that time to other jobs. Tests by CP and HDS's computer systems manager then showed that the computer programs, not being perfectly coordinated with HDS's billing methods, cut processing time by only 47%. They would, however, save HDS $12,000 a year. Further, if HDS would spend $5,000 to change its invoice preparation methods, as recommended by CP, the programs would cut processing time by a total of 58%, saving HDS another $8,000 a year. HDS's computer systems manager refused in good faith to certify satisfactory completion. HDS requested the escrow agent to return the $20,000 and asserted that nothing was owed to CP even though HDS continued to use the programs. Assume for this question only that the programs completed on July 5 had cut processing time by one-half for all of HDS's financial transactions. Is HDS entitled to renounce the contract because of Cl"s delay in completion?
12	On November 5, an athletic shoe manufacturer entered into a written contract with a shoe store to carry its running shoes. The contract included a provision that "5% of the proceeds attributable to the sale of the manufacturer's shoes by the shoe store during the month of February (American Heart Month) each year would be donated to the local hospital's new cardiovascular wing." The day after the parties signed their contract, the store owner informed the hospital of the planned donation and indicated that the hospital could expect to receive about $1,500 in early March. In anticipation of the donation, the hospital purchased a new heart monitor on January 5. On January 15, because the Christmas sales season had been poor, the manufacturer and the shoe store agreed to modify their contract to eliminate the provision for payments to the hospital's cardiovascular wing. What effect would this subsequent modification have on the hospital's right to institute an action for the lost proceeds (assuming that it otherwise had standing to collect the same)?
13	A singer has denied his purported signature on a letter that has become critical in a breach of contract suit between him and a record producer. At trial, the record producer's counsel calls a teacher who testifies that she taught the singer mathematics in school 10 years earlier, knows his signature, and proposes to testify that the signature to the letter is that of the singer. The singer's counsel objects. The trial judge should:
14	Scott held up a drugstore at 10:30 at night, and drove away. His car broke down in an isolated area just outside the small city in which the crime occurred. Scott walked to the nearest house and asked Henry, the homeowner, if he could stay until the next morning, explaining that he had been searching for his sister's home and had run out of gas. Henry agreed to let him sleep on a couch in the basement. During the course of the night, Henry began to doubt the story Scott had told him. Early the next morning, Henry called the police and said he was suspicious and frightened of a stranger whom he had allowed to stay the night. The police went immediately to the house to assist Henry and walked through the open front door. They found Scott and Henry drinking coffee in the kitchen. When they saw Scott, they realized he matched the description of the drugstore robber. They arrested Scott and in his jacket they found drugs taken during the robbery. Scott moves to suppress the evidence of the drugs. If the court finds that the police did not have probable cause to believe Scott was the robber until they saw him inside Henry's house and realized he matched the description, the court should
15	A defendant is on trial in federal court, charged with having sold cocaine to an undercover agent. The defendant calls a witness to the stand who testifies that she was with the defendant in another state on the date of the alleged drug sale. Following her testimony, the prosecution seeks to introduce the record of judgment of the witness's seven-year-old embezzlement conviction. The defendant's attorney objects. The court should rule the record of judgment:
16	A federal statute set up a program of dental education. The statute provided that the Secretary of Health and Human Services "shall, on a current basis, spend all of the money appropriated for this purpose" and "shall distribute the appropriated funds" by a specified formula to state health departments that agree to participate in the program. In the current year, Congress appropriated $100 million for expenditure on this program. To ensure a budget surplus in the current fiscal year, the President issued an executive order directing the various Cabinet secretaries to cut expenditures in this year by 10% in all categories. He also ordered certain programs to be cut more drastically because he believed that "they are not as important to the general welfare as other programs." The President identified the dental education program as such a program and ordered it to be cut by 50%. Assume that no other federal statutes are relevant. To satisfy constitutional requirements, how much money must the Secretary of Health and Human Services distribute for the dental education program this year?
17	In March, a homeowner contracted with a buyer to sell his house for $280,000, with the purchase price to be paid and the deed to be delivered on July 1. On May 1, the buyer wrote the homeowner a letter, stating that she has had second thoughts about buying the house, and she "won't pay that amount of money unless you repaint the house and fix up the yard." If the homeowner wishes to treat the contract as breached:
18	A shopper at a grocery store slipped and fell when he stepped in some water that had seeped out from a malfunctioning freezer case. The fall caused the shopper to break an ankle, so he filed suit against the store. At trial, the shopper presented evidence of the above facts, and testified that the floor around the water appeared dirty. To survive a motion for summary judgment by the store, what additional evidence must the shopper present?
19	A driver was traveling through an area plagued with a high incidence of burglaries and assaults. Acting pursuant to a police department plan to combat crime by the random stopping of automobiles in the area between midnight and 6 a.m., a police officer stopped the driver and asked him for identification. As the driver handed the officer his license, the officer directed a flashlight into the automobile and saw what appeared to be the barrel of a shotgun protruding from under the front seat on the passenger side of the car. The officer ordered the driver from the car, searched him, and discovered marijuana cigarettes and a shotgun. At the driver's trial for unlawful possession of narcotics, his motion to suppress the use of the marijuana as evidence should be:

HDS requested the escrow agent to return the $20,000 and asserted that nothing was owed to CP even though HDS continued to use the programs. Assume for this question only that CP was in breach of contract because of its four-day delay in completion and that an express condition precedent to HDS's duty to pay the contract price has failed. Can CP nevertheless recover the reasonable value of its services?
21	A pool hall seeking to attract more afternoon business advertised a $2 per hour table rental discount between the hours of 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. The ad caught the attention of students who attended a high school in the city where the pool hall was located, and soon the hall was bristling with students in the afternoon. To discourage city youth from frittering away their afternoons, the city council passed an ordinance imposing a $2 per hour rental tax on pool tables rented before 6 p.m. on weekdays. A lawsuit to challenge the tax could be brought by any of the following except:
22	At a waterfront bar, a college student sought to provoke a fight with a merchant seaman by making insulting remarks. Eventually the seaman had had enough and threw a punch that connected to the student's jaw and sent him sprawling to the floor. The seaman then told the student that he wanted no further trouble. Getting up off the floor, the student pulled a knife out of his pocket and charged at the seaman. Three other students were standing between the seaman and the exit door. The seaman tried to dodge, but was cut on the forearm by the student's knife. The seaman immediately drew a gun and shot the student, killing him. The seaman was charged with murder. Which of the following points raised in the seaman's defense will not be helpful for his defense?
23	Despondent over losing his job, Wilmont drank all night at a bar. While driving home, he noticed a car following him and, in his intoxicated state, concluded he was being followed by robbers. In fact, a police car was following him on suspicion of drunk driving. In his effort to get away, Wilmont sped through a stop sign and struck and killed a pedestrian. He was arrested by the police. Wilmont is prosecuted for manslaughter. He should be
24	A nervous man was persuaded by his girlfriend to go with her to a haunted house. He saw the signs in front of the haunted house warning that this attraction has live "monsters" who will be trying to scare people and is not for the faint of heart, and he also noticed the same warning printed on the tickets. He paid for his ticket and reluctantly went into the darkened house with his girlfriend. In the first room, an actor dressed as a large monster came at them with a shriek, and the man dove through one of the plate glass windows to the outside, severely lacerating his arms and face in the process. If the man brings an action against the actor, will he recover?
25	After negotiations, a painting contractor agreed with a homeowner to paint the exterior of her house for $20,000. The painter further agreed to use only top quality paint because the homeowner wanted the paint to last for many years. The painter filled out his standard form contract, but deliberately did not include a brand name for the paint that he would use. After telling the homeowner that the contract contained the terms agreed to, she signed without reading it. On completion of the job, the homeowner saw some empty paint cans in the painter's truck and realized that top quality paint had not been used. If the homeowner sues the paint contractor for misrepresentation, any statements made by the painter before the contract was signed:
26	A federal statute prohibits the sale or resale, in any place in this country, of any product intended for human consumption or ingestion into the human body that contains designated chemicals known to cause cancer, unless the product is clearly labeled as dangerous. The constitutionality of this federal statute may most easily be justified on the basis of the power of Congress to
27	The CEO of a pharmaceutical company wanted to reward his top salesperson. He knew that the salesperson's daughter was applying to medical school, so he met with them both and told them that he entered into a contract with the dean of admissions at a prestigious medical school that would guarantee admission to the daughter. The CEO did not disclose that the consideration for this contract was actually an illegal bribe. The daughter submitted her application only to that school and did not send applications to any other schools. Shortly thereafter, the dean of the medical school was removed from his position for other misconduct. The replacement dean denied the daughter admission based on her mediocre grades and test scores, and the deadline had passed for submitting applications to other schools that might have admitted her. Can the daughter successfully sue the CEO and the medical school for any damages she has suffered?
28	A consumer purchased a new television set from an electronics store. When he got home, he opened the box and found an owner's manual that contained operation instructions, warnings regarding the danger of electricity, and a warranty that stated: The store expressly warrants that this set shall be free of manufacturing defects for 30 days. If a set is defective, the store's liability shall be limited to the cost of repair or replacement of defective parts. The store "HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND THE WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY." Five weeks later, after the set was properly installed, the consumer turned on the set, heard a crackling noise, and watched as his television exploded and was destroyed. Under which of the following theories will the consumer most likely recover?
29	Purvis purchased a used car from Daley, a used car dealer. Knowing that they were false, Daley made the following statements to Purvis prior to the sale: Statement 1. This car has never been involved in an accident. Statement 2. This car gets 25 miles to the gallon on the open highway. Statement 3. This is as smooth-riding a car as you can get. If Purvis asserts a claim against Daley based on deceit, which of the false statements made by Daley would support Purvis' claim?

31	A plaintiff brought a malpractice action against a law firm that had represented him in a personal injury suit. The plaintiff alleges that the firm was derelict in failing to interview a doctor he suggested as a prospective expert witness. The firm's pleadings contend that the doctor was never brought to the attention of anyone at the firm and was never considered as a witness. The plaintiff wants to introduce a "proposed witness list" from his case file at the firm. After the name of the doctor is the notation, "the plaintiff wants us to check this guy out before trial." The notation is in the handwriting of a paralegal with the firm who is responsible for updating various case files as part of his regular duties. The paralegal did no direct work on the plaintiff's case and he cannot remember which attorney in the firm asked him to make the notation. The defense objects to the introduction of the proposed witness list containing the notation. The proposed witness list and notation are:
32	Sue owned a five-acre tract of land, one acre of which had previously been owned by Opal, but to which Sue had acquired title by adverse possession. Sue contracted to convey the full five-acre tract to Peg, but the contract did not specify the quality of title Sue would convey. At closing, Peg refused the tendered deed and demanded return of her earnest money. Suppose that before closing, the house on the property had been totally destroyed by fire. In determining the rights of Sue and Peg, the court would most likely consider the doctrine of equitable

34	Congress enacts a statute punishing "each and every conspiracy entered into by any two or more persons for the purpose of denying Black persons housing, employment, or education, solely because of their race"' Under which of the following constitutional provisions is the authority of Congress to pass such a statute most clearly and easily justifiable?
35	A police officer stopped a boyfriend and girlfriend on a college campus under suspicion that they were selling illegal drugs out of their backpacks. The officer asked the two some questions and then asked if he could look in their backpacks. They consented to the search, but the officer found nothing suspicious in either backpack. The officer then patted them both down and found a package of drugs taped to the boyfriend's chest. The boyfriend and the girlfriend were charged with possession. The boyfriend pleaded guilty to possession. Prior to trial, the girlfriend's attorney moved to suppress the introduction of the drugs at her trial. At the suppression hearing, the attorney stipulated that the girlfriend owned the drugs. How should the court rule on the motion?
36	A well-known Oscar-winning producer who owned the nation's leading special effects studio employed a creative designer who was recognized throughout the industry as one of the top talents in the special effects field. A competitor of the producer who wanted to hire the designer told him that that the producer was in negotiations to sell his studio to a major Hollywood film company. In fact this statement was not true, and the competitor made the statement without any knowledge of its truth or falsity. The designer, whose employment contract with the producer was terminable at will by either party, agreed to be hired by the competitor. The producer was very upset when he learned of the competitor's action because he knew that the designer would be almost impossible to replace, and brought suit against the competitor. If the producer establishes the above facts and that he suffered damages, he is likely to:
37	Two partners who operated an electronics retail store hired a thug to intimidate the owner of a discount electronics store that was undercutting their prices and drawing customers away. They told the thug to rob the store owner but not to harm him; they only wanted to scare him out of town. The thug loitered near the discount store, waiting for it to close. When the lights in the store went out, an employee left by the back exit. The thug thought he was the owner and drew his gun, demanding money. The employee resisted, and in the ensuing struggle was fatally shot. The thug ran off, but both he and the partners were eventually arrested. In addition to conspiracy to commit robbery, the partners are guilty of:
38	Twenty years ago, an uncle conveyed his real property to his niece and nephew as tenants in common. The niece and nephew were estranged, however, so only the niece moved onto the property. Last year, the nephew sued the niece for an accounting for the years that she had exclusive possession of the property. The statutory period for adverse possession in this jurisdiction is 15 years. The accounting will most likely be:
39	A rancher entered into a contract to sell her land to a developer for $60,000. The contract provided thatrthe rancher agreed to convey a good and marketable title to the developer 60 days from the date of the contract. At the time set for closing, the rancher tendered a deed in the form agreed to in the contract. The developer's examination of the record prior to the date of closing disclosed, however, that the owner of record was not the rancher, but a farmer. Further investigation by the developer revealed that, notwithstanding the state of the record, the rancher had been in what the developer concedes is adverse possession for 15 years. The period of time to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is 10 years. The developer refuses to pay the purchase price or to take possession because of the "inability" of the rancher to transfer a marketable title. In an appropriate action by the rancher against the developer for specific performance, the rancher will:
40	A dairy farm operated a small processing plant that supplied premium ice cream to nearby specialty shops and ice cream parlors. It entered into a written agreement with a local ice cream parlor to sell "all output" of its Extra Rich ice cream to the ice cream parlor, and the ice cream parlor agreed to sell exclusively the dairy farm's Extra Rich frozen desserts. The agreement stated that the ice cream parlor would pay $25 for each five-gallon container of Extra Rich ice cream that it ordered from the dairy farm. Several months after the parties entered into this contract, demand for high-fat ice creams dropped sharply among the health-conscious consumers who had formerly patronized the ice cream parlor, and the proprietor had to throw out some of its product because the reduced demand meant that opened containers were not used up before the taste of the ice cream became affected. The ice cream parlor wanted to stop selling the dairy farm's Extra Rich ice cream and instead sell a frozen yogurt product produced by another dairy. Can the dairy farm enforce its agreement against the ice cream parlor?
41	Walker, who knew nothing about horses, inherited Aberlone, a thoroughbred colt whose disagreeable behavior made him a pest around the barn. Walker sold the colt for $1,500 to Sherwood, an experienced racehorse-trainer who knew of Walker's ignorance about horses. At the time of sale, Walker said to Sherwood, "I hate to say it, but this horse is bad-tempered and nothing special." For this question only, assume that soon after the sale, Aberlone won three races and earned $400,000 for Sherwood. Which of the following additional facts, if established by Walker, would best support his chance of obtaining rescission of the sale to Sherwood?
42	Alpha and Beta made a written contract pursuant to which Alpha promised to convey a specified apartment house to Beta in return for Beta's promise (1) to convey a 100-acre farm to Alpha and (2) to pay Alpha $1,000 in cash six months after the exchange of the apartment house and the farm. The contract contained the following provision: "It is understood and agreed that Beta's obligation to pay the $1,000 six months after the exchangeof the apartment house and the farm shall be voided if Alpha has not, within three months after the aforesaid exchange, removed the existing shed in the parking area in the rear of the said apartment house." Which of the following statements concerning the order of performances is LEAST accurate?

Testimony concerning the wife's intoxication is
44	In order to provide funds for a system of new major airports near the ten largest cities in the United States, Congress levies a tax of $25 on each airline ticket issued in the United States. The tax applies to every airline ticket, even those for travel that does not originate in, terminate at, or pass through any of those ten large cities. As applied to the issuance in the United States of an airline ticket for travel between two cities that will not be served by any of the new airports, this tax is
45	Dock had been the unsuccessful suitor of Mary, who had recently announced her engagement to Paul. Angered by her engagement, Dock sent Mary the following letter: "I hope you know what you arc doing. The man you think you love wears women's clothes when at home. A Friend." The receipt of this letter caused Mary great emotional distress. She hysterically telephoned Paul. read him the letter, and told him that she was breaking their engagement. The contents of the letter were not revealed to others. Paul, who was a young attorney in the state attorney's office, suffered serious humiliation and emotional distress as a result of the broken engagement. If Paul asserts a claim against Dock based on defamation and it is proved that Dock's statement was true, such proof will be

The driver of the car immediately stopped and went to his assistance. She got him to his feet and was slowly moving him toward the curb when a negligently driven taxicab struck him in the left leg. The bicyclist required surgery on both his right ankle and his left leg. If the bicyclist sues the driver and the cabbie, the bicyclist can:
47	A landlord owned an apartment building. Needing money to make some repairs and improvements, he went to a bank and applied for a loan. The bank loaned the landlord $100,000, secured by a mortgage on the apartment building. Last month, the landlord defaulted on his mortgage payments. The bank instituted foreclosure proceedings and wishes to take possession of the apartment building in order to collect the rents from the property. Does the bank have the right to take possession of the apartment building before foreclosure?
48	A man and a woman decided to get married and made detailed plans accordingly. Unbeknownst to the woman, however, the man was already married. Nevertheless, he was able to get a minister to agree to perform the ceremony even though the minister knew that the man was already married. As the marriage ceremony was about to begin, the man confessed this fact to the woman and the ceremony was called off. The state in which the couple was to be married, and in which both reside, makes bigamy a strict liability crime. If the woman were to be tried for common law conspiracy to commit bigamy, she should be found:
49	Alpha and Beta made a written contract pursuant to which Alpha promised to convey a specified apartment house to Beta in return for Beta's promise (1) to convey a 100-acre farm to Alpha and (2) to pay Alpha $1,000 in cash six months after the exchange of the apartment house and the farm. The contract contained the following provision: "It is understood and agreed that Beta's obligation to pay the $1,000 six months after the exchangeof the apartment house and the farm shall be voided if Alpha has not, within three months after the aforesaid exchange, removed the existing shed in the parking area in the rear of the said apartment house." Alpha's removal of the shed from the parking area of the apartment house is
50	In a prosecution of Dale for murdering Vera, Dale testified that the killing had occurred in self defense when Vera tried to shoot him. In rebuttal, the prosecution seeks to call Walter, Vera's father, to testify that the day before the killing, Vera told Walter that she loved Dale so much she could never hurt him. Walter's testimony is
51	A singer entered into a contract with a hairstylist. The stylist agreed to accompany the singer on her six-month world tour and to fix her hair for each performance, in exchange for a large fee to be paid on completion of the tour. Two months into the tour, the stylist grew tired of life on the road and assigned "all his rights and duties" under the contract to his assistant. When the singer learned that the stylist had made the assignment and left the tour, she was distraught, but since she needed someone to style her hair for that night's show she allowed the assistant to take over. The next night, without legal excuse, the assistant abandoned the tour, leaving the singer without anyone to style her hair before that night's concert. Which of the following legal conclusions is correct?
52	Ames had painted Bell's house under a contract which called for payment of $2,000. Bell, contending in good faith that the porch had not been painted properly, refused to pay anything. On June 15, Ames mailed a letter to Bell stating, "I am in serious need of money. Please send the $2,000 to me before July 1." On June 18, Bell replied, "I will settle for $1,800 provided you agree to repaint the porch." Ames did not reply to this letter. Thereafter Bell mailed a check for $1,800 marked "Payment in full on the Ames-Bell painting contract as per letter dated June 18." Ames received the check on June 30. Because he was badly in need of money, Ames cashed the check without objection and spent the proceeds but has refused to repaint the porch. Bell's refusal to pay anything to Ames when he finished painting was a
53	A test preparation course sued a rival program for interference with business relations. The rival program had taken the test preparation course's reply cards from various colleges and mailed them in, hoping to swamp the clerks with work and cut the course's profit margin. The rival program also induced a professor under contract with the course to break his contract and lecture with the rival program for a percentage of the profits. The course director caught on to what the rival program was up to after the professor suddenly left the course. The director ordered his clerks to log in, for a two-week period, any and all business reply requests from the rival program's city. Immediately after the tally record was complete, the test preparation course filed its suit. At trial, the course's attorney offers the tally record into evidence. The defense attorney objects. The court should find the tally record:
54	A federal statute provides that the United States Supreme Court has authority to review any case filed in a United States Court of Appeals, even though that case has not yet been decided by the court of appeals. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), an agency in the executive branch of the federal government, issued an important environmental rule. Although the rule had not yet been enforced against them, companies that would be adversely affected by the rule filed a petition for review of the rule in a court of appeals, seeking a declaration that the rule was invalid solely because it was beyond the statutory authority of the EPA. The companies made no constitutional claim. A statute specifically provides for direct review of EPA rules by a court of appeals without any initial action in a district court. The companies have filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court requesting immediate review of this case by the Supreme Court before the court of appeals has actually decided the case. The EPA acknowledges that the case is important enough to warrant Supreme Court review and that it should be decided promptly, but it asks the Supreme Court to dismiss the petition on jurisdictional grounds. The best constitutional argument in support of the EPA's request is that
55	A freshman beat out a senior for the starting middle linebacker position on their college football team. After practice, the senior came up behind the freshman and shoved him in the back. When the freshman turned around, the senior punched him in the jaw, knocking out a tooth and giving him a split lip. Before the freshman could retaliate, the two were quickly separated by other players. The senior taunted him, "The next time I see you I won't go so easy on you." That night the freshman was at a bar frequented by the football players, some of whom were teasing him about the altercation that afternoon. The freshman was enraged but did not respond. He then saw the senior enter the room but kept his back to him. Suddenly he felt someone shove him in the back. Pulling out his pocketknife, he whirled and stabbed the person behind him, believing it to be the senior. In fact, it was an intoxicated patron who had stumbled and fallen into the freshman. The knife severed a major artery, and the patron died on the way to the hospital. The freshman is charged with murder for the patron's death. At trial, the freshman testified that he honestly believed that the senior was going to kill him the next time he saw him. On cross-examination, he admitted that such a belief was unreasonable. The freshman's attorney requests the judge to instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter, both on an "imperfect selfdefense" theory and on a "heat of passion" basis. How should the judge respond?
56	Pursuant to a state statute, a student applied for tuition assistance to attend a state university. He was qualified for such assistance in every way except that he was a resident alien who did not intend to become a United States citizen. The state's restriction of such grants to United States citizens or resident aliens seeking such citizenship is probably:
57	Carr ran into and injured Pedersen, a pedestrian. With Carr in his car were Wanda and Walter Passenger. Passerby saw the accident and called the police department, which sent Sheriff to investigate. All of these people are available as potential witnesses in the case of Pedersen v. Carr. Pedersen alleges that Carr, while drunk, struck Pedersen who was in a duly marked crosswalk. Pedersen's counsel wishes to prove that after the accident Carr went to Pedersen and offered $1,000 to settle Pedersen's claim. The trial judge should rule this evidence
58	In a collision case, Plaintiff offers in evidence a photograph showing the scene of the accident while the cars were still in place. A proper foundation must include, as a minimum, testimony by which of the following?
59	On an icy day, a vehicle driven by the defendant struck the plaintiff's car in the rear, smashing a taillight and denting the plaintiff's bumper. Before the plaintiff could say anything, the defendant rushed out of his car and told the plaintiff, "Look, if you'll take $500 for the damage, I'm sure my insurance company will pay for it." The plaintiff refused and sued the defendant for damage to his car and minor personal injuries. The plaintiff wishes to testify as to the defendant's statement at the time of the accident. The defendant objects. Should the court allow the defendant's statement to be admitted?
60	A pdt6 manufacturer entered into a written agreement with a gourmet food store. The manufacturer agreed to sell "all" its "output of liver pat6" to the store and the store agreed to sell the manufacturer's pdt6 "exclusively." The agreement between the store and the manufacturer also contained the statement, "either party may cancel this contract after two months on giving reasonable notice to the other party." After the manufacturer filled the store's orders for six months, the manufacturer determined that it was becoming too costly to operate and maintain the special oven used to roast the pat6 loaves, and that it would be difficult and expensive to find a suitable substitute. The manufacturer, therefore, notified the store that it was getting out of the pat6 business, and explained why, and that it would stop shipping pat6 to the store after 60 days. The store sued the manufacturer, demanding that the manufacturer continue to ship pat6 to the store or pay monetary damages. Will the store prevail?
61	A victim and his former business partner, the defendant, had a bitter falling out after the victim accused the defendant of embezzling company funds. The defendant threatened to get even. Shortly thereafter, while driving on the expressway, a car swerved suddenly in front of the victim's car. Although the victim applied the brakes immediately, his car failed to stop. To avoid colliding with the car ahead of him, he swerved to the right and smashed into a concrete retaining wall. A passing motorist stopped and came to the aid of the victim. Bleeding profusely from a head wound, and rapidly losing consciousness, the victim said, "I don't think I'm going to make it. I tried to slow down, but my brakes didn't work. My former partner must have tampered with them to get back at me." With that, the victim lapsed into unconsciousness, and has been in a coma and on life support ever since. A personal injury suit has been filed on his behalf by a court-appointed guardian against the defendant. At trial, can the motorist testify as to the statement made by the victim?
62	A beekeeper sued the manufacturer of a specially designed helmet and faceguard that was designed to protect the wearer from bee stings. The beekeeper alleged that he was wearing the helmet and faceguard when he was stung on the left cheek by a bee that had entered through a small tear in the faceguard, and that, one hour later, the beekeeper suffered a heart attack. The beekeeper's physician, having listened to the beekeeper testify to the foregoing facts at trial, is called by the beekeeper and asked whether, assuming the truth of such testimony, the beekeeper's subsequent heart attack could have resulted from the bee sting. The physician's opinion is:
63	Sue owned a five-acre tract of land, one acre of which had previously been owned by Opal, but to which Sue had acquired title by adverse possession. Sue contracted to convey the full five-acre tract to Peg, but the contract did not specify the quality of title Sue would convey. At closing, Peg refused the tendered deed and demanded return of her earnest money. Suppose Sue's contract had called for the conveyance of 'a good and marketable title." Pursuant to that contract, Peg paid the purchase price and accepted a deed from Sue containing no covenants of title. Sue's title to the one acre subsequently proved defective and Peg was ejected by Opal. Peg sued Sue. Which of the following results is most likely?
64	PullCo sued Davidson, its former vice president, for return of $230,000 that had been embezzled during the previous two years. Called by PullCo as an adverse witness, Davidson testified that his annual salary had been $75,000, and he denied the embezzlement. PullCo calls banker Witt to show that, during the two-year period, Davidson had deposited $250,000 in his bank account. Witt's testimony is
65	A wholesale seller of DVD players e-mailed a message to the owner of a retail electronics store, stating that he had recently received a new shipment of 200 X-Brand DVD players that were available for sale to the store owner. In a return e-mail, the store owner agreed to purchase the DVD players, but added that it would be easier, given his limited space, if the wholesaler delivered 50 of the DVD players each month for the next four months. The wholesaler e-mailed back to the store owner, saying that he would only ship the entire order of 200 DVD players now. If the wholesaler then tenders the 200 DVD players, the store owner:
66	A man was a permanent resident alien of the United States who was awaiting an opportunity to become a citizen. He filed an application to become an instructor in the local public high school but was denied the position solely on the ground that he was not a citizen. The man now brings suit, alleging that his status as a resident alien was not a proper ground for denying him a position as an instructor. May the state deny a permanent resident alien employment as an instructor in the public high school?
67	The legislature of the state of Chetopah enacted a statute requiring that all law enforcement officers in that state be citizens of the United States. Alien, lawfully admitted to permanent residency five years before the enactment of this statute, sought employment as a forensic pathologist in the Chetopah coroner's office. He was denied such a job solely because he was not a citizen. Alien thereupon brought suit in federal district court against appropriate Chetopah officials seeking to invalidate this citizenship requirement on federal constitutional grounds. The strongest ground upon which to attack this citizenship requirement is that it
68	A bill was introduced into a state legislature barring the processing of plutonium, a radioactive artificial element, in the state. After extensive public hearings it was clear that the bill had strong support in both houses of the state legislature and that, if called to a vote, the bill would pass easily. The governor had also made a major speech announcing that he would sign such a bill. However, a few members of the legislature raised questions as to the bill's constitutionality. The state constitution provides that the state supreme court may hand down declaratory judgments, and the question of the bill's constitutionality was brought before the state supreme court. The court ruled that the bill, in the form it was introduced into the legislature, was constitutional. A corporation currently owns the only plutonium processing plant in the state. The plant operates under a contract with the federal government and is highly profitable for the corporation. The corporation seeks to have the judgment of the state supreme court overturned, and its attorneys have filed appropriate papers to bring the case before the United States Supreme Court. The Court should:
69	A woman graduated from a law school in a state that does not require graduates from that state's law schools to take and pass the bar examination in order to practice law. She moved to another state and wished to practice law without taking and passing that state's bar examination. In state court, she challenges the constitutionality of that state's requirement that she pass the bar in order to practice law there. She will probably:
70	Deland operates a bank courier service that uses armored trucks to transport money and securities. One of Deland's armored trucks was parked illegally, too close to a street intersection. Pilcher, driving his car at an excessive speed, skidded into the armored truck while trying to make a turn. The truck was not damaged, but Pilcher was injured. Pilcher has brought an action against Deland to recover damages for his loss resulting from the accident. The jurisdiction follows a pure comparative negligence rule. In this action, Pilcher should recover
71	Trawf, the manager of a state fair, contracted with Schweinebauch, a renowned hog breeder, to exhibit Schweinebauch's world champion animal, Megahawg, for the three weeks of the annual fair, at the conclusion of which Schweinebauch would receive an honorarium of $300. Two days before the opening of the fair, Megahawg took sick with boarsitis, a communicable disease among swine, and, under the applicable state quarantine law, very probably could not be exhibited for at least a month. Upon learning this, Trawf can legally pursue which of the following courses of action with respect to his contract with Schweinebauch?
72	A motorist drove home from work late one night, and fell asleep behind the wheel of his car. His car drifted across the middle of the road and struck another car. The other driver was killed instantly in the collision. Angered by the noise of the collision, a homeowner fired a gun out the window of his house at the car. The bullet struck and killed a bystander. Both the motorist and the homeowner were arrested and charged with common law murder. Which of the defendants likely would be found guilty?
73	Orris had title to Brownacre in fee simple. Without Orris' knowledge, Hull entered Brownacre in 1950 and constructed an earthen dam across a watercourse. The earthen dam trapped water that Hull used to water a herd of cattle he owned. After 12 years of possession of Brownacre, Hull gave possession of Brownacre to Burns. At the same time, Hull also purported to transfer his cattle and all his interests in the dam and water to Burns by a document that was sufficient as a bill of sale to transfer personal property but was insufficient as a deed to transfer real property. One year later, Burns entered into a lease with Orris to lease Brownacre for a period of five years. After the end of the five-year term of the lease, Burns remained on Brownacre for an additional three years and then left Brownacre. At that time Orris conveyed Brownacre by a quitclaim deed to Powell. The period of time to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is 10 years. After Orris's conveyance to Powell, title to Brownacre was in
74	A large farming concern in the Midwest contracted with a pet food manufacturer to deliver 100 tons of processed cornmeal no later than November 15. The purchase price and delivery terms were specified in the contract, which permitted partial shipments. On November 1, the farming concern delivered 50 tons of cornmeal to the pet food manufacturer with the notification that the balance would be shipped by November 15. The pet food manufacturer rejected the shipment because the written documentation accompanying the shipment did not establish that the cornmeal came from an approved source, as required by the contract. The farming concern responded to this rejection by conceding that the shipment did not conform to the contract and promising to deliver all 100 tons of cornmeal by November 15 with proper documentation. Which of the following best expresses the pet food manufacturer's options?
75	In an effort to standardize laws pertaining to the solicitation of business by mail, Congress adopted a statute establishing certain requirements that must be met before an organization can solicit business through the mails. A national religious organization that solicited charitable contributions by mail determined that the federal statute would substantially interfere with the successful accomplishment of the organization's religious objectives. The organization files suit seeking a declaratory judgment that the federal law may not be applied to its solicitation activities. Which of the following, as a matter of constitutional law, best describes the burden that must be sustained?
76	A state was suffering from a near-depression caused by layoffs in the tourist service industry. In an attempt to alleviate the problem, the state enacted a statute providing for the immediate hiring of 100,000 employees to repair, maintain, and otherwise work at the discretion of the state director of highways. The statute further stated that preference would be given to persons who had worked in the tourist service industry for five years and had been laid off. Which of the following constitutional provisions would be most relevant in determining the constitutionality of the preference for tourist service industry workers?
77	On the last play of a playoff football game, a game-winning touchdown was nullified by a questionable penalty called by the referee. To register her displeasure but without intending to hit anyone, a fan sitting in the stands threw a bottle onto the field that just missed the head of the referee, who was looking in the other direction and did not see the bottle being thrown. The fan was charged with assault. The fan should be:
78	Grace, while baby-sitting one night, noticed that Sam, who lived next door, had left his house but that the door did not close completely behind him. Grace said to Roy, the 11-year-old boy she was baby-sitting with, "Let's play a game. You go next door and see if you can find my portable television set, which I lent to Sam, and bring it over here." Grace knew that Sam had a portable television set and Grace planned to keep the set for herself. Roy thought the set belonged to Grace, went next door, found the television set, and carried it out the front door. At that moment, Sam returned home and discovered Roy in his front yard with the television set. Roy explained the "game" he and Grace were playing. Sam took back his television set and called the police. Grace is
79	A defendant was on trial for the murder of his business partner. The prosecution offered testimony by the telephone operator in the defendant's office that she had listened in without the defendant's knowledge to a telephone call he had received the day before his partner's death, in which an unidentified man said that he heard talk in a bar the previous night that the business partner was going to tell the cops about a phony insurance claim involving the defendant. The defense attorney objects to this testimony. The trial court should:
80	All of the deeds for the lots on a city block contained a restrictive covenant requiring that all houses built on the lots be set back a minimum of 50 feet from the sidewalk. Local zoning regulations required that all homes on the block be set back a minimum of 35 feet from the sidewalk. A man purchased a lot on the block on which it would be possible to build a home with a 50-foot setback. However, the man applied to the city zoning commission for a variance reducing the setback to 30 feet from the sidewalk. In his petition, the man cited the unusual shape of the lot and asserted that it would cause hardship for him to build in compliance with the 35-foot setback required by the zoning regulations. The zoning commission granted the man the variance. A woman whose home was located on the block noticed surveyors putting up ropes 30 feet from the sidewalk on the man's lot, and she discovered that the man planned to build a home with only a 30-foot setback. The woman brings suit to enjoin the man from building a residence with a setback of less than 50 feet. Who will prevail?
81	A thief sold some stolen goods to a dealer. Several weeks later, the police raided the dealer's store and arrested him. In this raid, the police seized the goods the thief sold to the dealer and a record book in which the dealer had recorded this transaction. However, at the dealer's subsequent trial for receiving stolen goods, the charges against him were dismissed when the court ruled that the search warrant had been improperly issued. The police were able to trace the stolen goods to the thief because of fingerprint identification and Oie information contained in the dealer's record book. At his trial, the thief made a motion to suppress the stolen goods and record book. The judge should:
82	A state statute provides that only citizens of the United States may be employed by that state. In an action brought in a federal court, a resident alien who was prevented from obtaining state employment as a garbage collector solely because of his alien status challenged the statute's constitutionality as applied to his circumstances. Which of the following statements concerning the burden of persuasion applicable to this suit is correct?
83	A 15-year-old sophomore high school student became pregnant, and the school board required her to attend a special program for pregnant students instead of her regular classes. The girl did not want to attend a special program; rather, she wanted to attend her regular classes. She sued the school district in federal district court, demanding that she be allowed to attend her regular classes. Before her case came to trial, the girl gave birth to the child. Subsequently, the district reinstated her in her regular classes. When her suit comes before the federal district court, the court should:
84	A state has a modern theft statute that combines such common law crimes as larceny, embezzlement, and receiving stolen property into one comprehensive crime. The police arrested a car dealer who had been dealing in stolen cars. When the police suggested strongly that it might be in his best interests to cooperate with a police "sting" operation, the dealer readily police told the dealer to continue to purchase stolen autos from thieves, but to inform the police when a buyer was about to purchase a stolen car. The police would then arrest the buyer. The defendant approached the dealer on his car lot, asking for a late-model used car at a good price. The dealer told the defendant that he had a sedan that he was willing to sell, and he quoted a price that was half "book value" of the car. The dealer told the defendant that the sedan was "hot," to which the defendant responded, "It's none of my business where you got the car; I just asked for a late-model car at a good price.' The defendant then gave the dealer the money and the dealer gave the defendant the keys. The dealer went to his office to complete the paperwork and informed the police of the transaction. The defendant was arrested and charged with theft. As an attorney assigned to the district attorney's felony review group, which decides whether cases should be pursued or dropped, you should advise that the charge should be:
85	James and Mary Green were walking to their car one evening after having seen a movie. As they were passing a dark alleyway, Daves leaped out brandishing a gun. He pushed Mary against the wall of a nearby building, held the gun to her head, and demanded money from James. James handed over his cash. Daves grabbed the cash and ran away. Which of the following, listed in descending order of seriousness, is the most serious crime for which Daves may be convicted?
86	Congress passed a law imposing a 50% excise tax on each pack of cigarettes manufactured for sale in the United States. An amendment was successfully added to the original bill requiring that all proceeds from the tax be used for antismoking educational programs in the audio, video, and print media and elsewhere. The amendment also provided for the establishment of federal stop-smoking clinics funded through the excise tax. The various tobacco companies were required to pay the tax directly to the federal government. A tobacco company filed suit in the appropriate federal court, contending that the tax should be struck down as unconstitutional. Is the court likely to find the tax constitutional?
87	The owner of a small business had a written contract with a cleaning company to clean the business's building on a daily basis. One week prior to the contract's expiration date, the parties agreed to a new contract that would contain the same terms as the prior contract, which the owner would prepare. When the owner gave the new contract to the cleaner for his signature, the owner represented that it was the same as the old contract. However, the owner knew this was not true because he included new cleaning duties that were not in the earlier contract. Relying on the owner's representations, the cleaner signed the contract without reading it. If the cleaner sues the business, he could obtain:
88	A father of a boy preparing for his bar mitzvah ceremony entered into an oral contract with a professional photographer. The contract provided that the photographer would take photos of the boy's bar mitzvah celebration in two weeks in exchange for $1,000. The contract also provided that the father was to pay a named creditor of the photographer rather than the photographer herself. One week after making the contract, the father learned that his brother-inlaw, a fairly good amateur photographer, would take the photographs free of charge. The father called the photographer that same day to tell her that their deal was off. The creditor to whom the father was to make payment had not become aware of any agreement between the father and the photographer. Which of the following is true?
89	A state located in the southern half of the United States experienced a strong influx of retirees, due in part to its mild winters and in part to the generous health benefits that the state historically provided to its elderly residents who fell below the federal poverty line. The state's Office of Budget Management determined that the influx of retirees would bankrupt the state's health care benefit fund within five years. To preserve the fund and ensure the health of its citizens, the state revised its health care statute to make persons ineligible for coverage until they have lived in the state for at least one year. If a retiree who was denied benefits because she just moved to the state challenges the constitutionality of the statute in federal court, is she likely to prevail?
90	A buyer entered into a written contract with a seller to purchase his commercial property for $100,000. The contract did not specify the quality of title to be conveyed, and made no mention of easements or reservations. The closing was set for November 25, three months from the signing of the contract. Shortly thereafter, the buyer obtained a survey of the property, which revealed that the city had an easement for the public sidewalk that ran in front of the store. Because this actually enhanced the value of the property, the buyer did not mention it to the seller. Subsequently, the buyer found a better location for her business. On November 1, the buyer notified the seller that she no longer intended to purchase the property. The seller told her that he intended to hold her to her contract. At closing, the buyer refused to tender the purchase price, claiming that the seller's title is unmarketable and citing the sidewalk easement as proof of that fact. In a suit for specific performance, the seller will most likely:
91	On March 1, Computer Programs, Inc. (CP) orally agreed with Holiday Department Store (HDS) to write a set of programs for HDS's computer and to coordinate the programs with HDS's billing methods. A subsequent memo, signed by both parties, provided in its entirety: HDS will pay CP $20,000 in two equal installments within one month of completion if CP is successful in shortening by one-half the processing time for the financial transactions now handled on HDS's Zenon 747 computer; CP to complete by July 1. This agreement may be amended only by a signed writing. On June 6, CP demanded $10,000, saying the job was one-half done. After HDS denied liability, the parties orally agreed that HDS should deposit $20,000 in escrow, pending completion to the satisfaction of HDS's computer systems manager. The escrow deposit was thereupon made. On July 5, CP completed the programs, having used an amount of time in which it could have earned $18,000 had it devoted that time to other jobs. Tests by CP and HDS's computer systems manager then showed that the computer programs, not being perfectly coordinated with HDS's billing methods, cut processing time by only 47%. They would, however, save HDS $12,000 a year. Further, if HDS would spend $5,000 to change its invoice preparation methods, as recommended by CP, the programs would cut processing time by a total of 58%, saving HDS another $8,000 a year. HDS's computer systems manager refused in good faith to certify satisfactory completion. HDS requested the escrow agent to return the $20,000 and asserted that nothing was owed to CP even though HDS continued to use the programs. If CP in fact had half-completed the job on June 6, would it then have been entitled to $10,000 ?
92	Green is cited for contempt of the House of Representatives after she refused to answer certain questions posed by a House Committee concerning her acts while serving as a United States Ambassador. A federal statute authorizes the Attorney General to prosecute contempts of Congress. Pursuant to this law, the House directs the Attorney General to begin criminal proceedings against Green. A federal grand jury indicts Green, but the Attorney General refuses to sign the indictment. If the Attorney General signs the indictment, the strongest argument Green could urge as a defense is that
93	On January 15, Carpenter agreed to repair Householder's house according to certain specifications and to have the work completed by April 1. On March 1, Householder's property was inundated by flood waters which did not abate until March 15. Householder could not get the house in a condition which would permit Carpenter to begin the repairs until March 31. On that date Carpenter notified Householder that he would not repair the house. Which one of the following facts, if it was the only one true and known to both parties on January 15, would best serve Carpenter as the basis for a defense in an action brought against him by Householder for breach of contract?
94	Pawn sued Dalton for injuries received when she fell down a stairway in Dalton's apartment building. Pawn, a guest in the building, alleged that she caught the heel of her shoe in a tear in the stair carpet. Pawn calls Witt, a tenant, to testify that Young, another tenant, had said to him a week before Pawn's fall: "When I paid my rent this morning, I told the manager he had better fix that torn carpet." Young's statement, reported by Witt, is
95	A downtown department store engaged an electrician to service all electrical appliances sold by the store for a flat fee of $5,000 per month. Under a written contract signed by both parties, the store was responsible for pickup and delivery of the appliances to be repaired and the billing for the work. By its terms, the contract would continue until either party gave 180 days' written notice of its intent to terminate. Several months ago the electrician informed the store that he was losing money on the deal and was in financial trouble. He requested in good faith that the fee for the next three months be increased by $1,000 and that this increase be paid to a local bank to help pay off a loan that the bank had made to the electrician. The store orally agreed to so modify the original contract. However, the store did not pay the bank and now the bank is suing the store for $3,000. Who will prevail?
96	Sam told Horace, his neighbor, that he was going away for two weeks and asked Horace to keep an eye on his house. Horace agreed. Sam gave Horace a key to use to check on the house. Horace decided to have a party in Sam's house. He invited a number of friends. One friend, Lewis, went into Sam's bedroom, took some of Sam's rings, and put them in his pocket. Which of the following is true?
97	In a single writing, Painter contracted with Farmer to paint three identical barns on her rural estate for $2,000 each. The contract provided for Farmer's payment of $6,000 upon Painter's completion of the work on all three barns. Painter did not ask for any payment when the first barn was completely painted, but she demanded $4,000 after painting the second barn. For this question only, assume that Farmer rightfully refused Painter's demand for payment. If Painter immediately terminates the contract without painting the third barn, what is Painter entitled to recover from Farmer?
98	Ogden was the fee simple owner of three adjoining vacant lots fronting on a common street in a primarily residential section of a city which had no zoning laws. The lots were identified as Lots 1, 2, and 3. Ogden conveyed Lot 1 to Akers and Lot 2 to Bell. Ogden retained Lot 3, which consisted of three acres of woodland. Bell, whose lot was between the other two, built a house on his lot. Bell's house included a large window on the side facing Lot 3. The window provided a beautiful view from Bell's living room, thereby adding value to Bell's house. Akers erected a house on his lot. Ogden made no complaint to either Akers or Bell concerning the houses they built. After both Akers and Bell had completed their houses, the two of them agreed to and did build a common driveway running from the street to the rear of their respective lots. The driveway was built on the line between the two houses so that one-half of the way was located on each lot. Akers and Bell exchanged right-ofway deeds by which each of them conveyed to the other, his heirs and assigns, an easement to continue the right of way. Both deeds were properly recorded. After Akers and Bell had lived in their respective houses for thirty years, a new public street was built bordering on the rear of Lots 1, 2, and 3. Akers informed Bell that, since the new street removed the need for their common driveway, he considered the right-of-way terminated; therefore, he intended to discontinue its use and expected Bell to do the same. At about the same time, Ogden began the erection of a six-story apartment house on Lot 3. If the apartment house is completed, it will block the view from Bell's window and will substantially reduce the value of Bell's lot. In an action brought by Bell to enjoin Akers from interfering with Bell's continued use of the common driveway between the two lots, the decision should be for
99	Andres conveyed Applewood Farm "to Bogatz, her heirs and assigns, so long as the premises are used for residential and farm purposes, then to Cohen and his heirs." The common law Rule Against Perpetuities, unmodified by statute, is part of the law of the jurisdiction in which Applewood Farm is located. As a consequence of the conveyance, Cohen's interest in Applewood Farm is
100	A state requires that persons holding a state license to practice a particular profession reside in the state for at least one year before engaging in that practice. A practitioner who held the state license moved into the state and shortly thereafter contracted with a local business to provide professional services. As soon as he began practicing his profession, the state licensing board sought to sanction him for violating the one-year waiting period. Which of the following provides the strongest basis for the practitioner to challenge the waiting period?
101	Roberta Monk, a famous author, had a life insurance policy with Drummond Life Insurance Company. Her son, Peter, was beneficiary. Roberta disappeared from her residence in the city of Metropolis two years ago and has not been seen since. On the day that Roberta disappeared, Sky Airlines Flight 22 left Metropolis for Rio de Janeiro and vanished; the plane's passenger list included a Roberta Rector. Peter is now suing Drummond Life Insurance Company for the proceeds of his mother's policy. At trial, Peter offers to testify that his mother told him that she planned to write her next novel under the pen name of Roberta Rector. Peter's testimony is
102	A woman entered into a written contract with her local wigmaker to pay $2,000 for a long silver wig, which was in fashion at the time. The wigmaker completed the wig by the date he had promised, but by that time silver wigs were out of style, and the woman refused to accept the wig or pay for it. The wigmaker spent $200 in making the wig, but because the wig was so out of fashion, the best he could do in good faith was to sell the wig to a Halloween store for $20. If the wigmaker sues the woman, what is the most he can recover?
103	On March 1, Computer Programs, Inc. (CP) orally agreed with Holiday Department Store (HDS) to write a set of programs for HDS's computer and to coordinate the programs with HDS's billing methods. A subsequent memo, signed by both parties, provided in its entirety: HDS will pay CP $20,000 in two equal installments within one month of completion if CP is successful in shortening by one-half the processing time for the financial transactions now handled on HDS's Zenon 747 computer; CP to complete by July 1. This agreement may be amended only by a signed writing. On June 6, CP demanded $10,000, saying the job was one-half done. After HDS denied liability, the parties orally agreed that HDS should deposit $20,000 in escrow, pending completion to the satisfaction of HDS's computer systems manager. The escrow deposit was thereupon made. On July 5, CP completed the programs, having used an amount of time in which it could have earned $18,000 had it devoted that time to other jobs. Tests by CP and HDS's computer systems manager then showed that the computer programs, not being perfectly coordinated with HDS's billing methods, cut processing time by only 47%. They would, however, save HDS $12,000 a year. Further, if HDS would spend $5,000 to change its invoice preparation methods, as recommended by CP, the programs would cut processing time by a total of 58%, saving HDS another $8,000 a year. HDS's computer systems manager refused in good faith to certify satisfactory completion. HDS requested the escrow agent to return the $20,000 and asserted that nothing was owed to CP even though HDS continued to use the programs. Was the escrow agreement a valid modification?
104	Pitt sued Dow for damages for injuries that Pitt incurred when a badly rotted limb fell from a curbside tree in front of Dow's home and hit Pitt. Dow claimed that the tree was on city property and thus was the responsibility of the city. At trial, Pitt offered testimony that a week after the accident, Dow had cut the tree down with a chainsaw. The offered evidence is
105	At a party for coworkers at Defendant's home, Victim accused Defendant of making advances toward his wife. Victim and his wife left the party. The next day at work, Defendant saw Victim and struck him on the head with a softdrink bottle. Victim fell into a coma and died two weeks after the incident. This jurisdiction defines aggravated assault as an assault with any weapon or dangerous implement and punishes it as a felony. It defines murder as the unlawful killing of a person with malice aforethought or in the course of an independent felony. Defendant may be found guilty of murder
106	Walker, who knew nothing about horses, inherited Aberlone, a thoroughbred colt whose disagreeable behavior made him a pest around the barn. Walker sold the colt for $1,500 to Sherwood, an experienced racehorse-trainer who knew of Walker's ignorance about horses. At the time of sale, Walker said to Sherwood, "I hate to say it, but this horse is bad-tempered and nothing special." Which one of the following scenarios would best support an action by Sherwood, rather than Walker, to rescind the sale?
107	The respective deeds of a farm and a ranch established the boundary between them as "a line drawn along the middle of the river." Over time, the river changed its course so that 10 acres of land that was formerly on the farm's side of the river are now on the ranch's side. Who owns the 10 acres?
108	On March 1, Computer Programs, Inc. (CP) orally agreed with Holiday Department Store (HDS) to write a set of programs for HDS's computer and to coordinate the programs with HDS's billing methods. A subsequent memo, signed by both parties, provided in its entirety: HDS will pay CP $20,000 in two equal installments within one month of completion if CP is successful in shortening by one-half the processing time for the financial transactions now handled on HDS's Zenon 747 computer; CP to complete by July 1.

Further, if HDS would spend $5,000 to change its invoice preparation methods, as recommended by CP, the programs would cut processing time by a total of 58%, saving HDS another $8,000 a year. HDS's computer systems manager refused in good faith to certify satisfactory completion. HDS requested the escrow agent to return the $20,000 and asserted that nothing was owed to CP even though HDS continued to use the programs. Assume for this question only that CP's delay in completion did not give HDS the right to renounce the contract and that the parties' escrow agreement was enforceable. Is CP entitled to recover damages for breach of the contract?
109	Alex and Sam were arrested for holding up a gas station. They were taken to police headquarters and placed in a room for interrogation. As a police officer addressingboth started to give them the Miranda warnings prior to the questioning, Alex said, "Look, Sam planned the damned thing and I was dumb enough to go along with it. We robbed the place-what else is there to say?" Sam said nothing. Sam was escorted into another room and a full written confession was then obtained from Alex. If Sam is brought to trial on an indictment charging him with robbery, the fact that Sam failed to object to Alex's statement and remained silent after Alex had implicated him in the crime should be ruled
110	Responding to County's written advertisement for bids, Tyres was the successful bidder for the sale of tires to County for County's vehicles. Tyres and County entered into a signed, written agreement that specified, "It is agreed that Tyres will deliver all tires required by this agreement to County, in accordance with the attached bid form and specifications, for a one-year period beginning September 1, 1990." Attached to the agreement was a copy of the bid form and specifications. In the written advertisement to which Tyres had responded, but not in the bid form, County had stated, "Multiple awards may be issued if they are in the best interests of County." No definite quantity of tires to be bought by County from Tyres was specified in any of these documents. In January 1991, Tyres learned that County was buying some of its tires from one of Tyres's competitors. Contending that the Tyres-County agreement was a requirements contract, Tyres sued County for the damages caused by County's buying some of its tires from the competitor. If the court concludes that the Tyres-County contract is an agreement by County to buy its tire requirements from Tyres, Tyres probably will
111	Dora, who was eight years old, went to the grocery store with her mother. Dora pushed the grocery cart while her mother put items into it. Dora's mother remained near Dora at all times. Peterson, another customer in the store, noticed Dora pushing the cart in a manner that caused Peterson no concern. A short time later, the cart Dora was pushing struck Peterson in the knee, inflicting serious injury. If Peterson brings an action, based on negligence, against Dora, Dora's best argument in defense would be that
112	Deeb was charged with stealing furs from a van. At trial, Wallace testified she saw Deeb take the furs. The jurisdiction in which Deeb is being tried does not allow in evidence lie detector results. On cross-examination by Deeb's attorney, Wallace was asked, "The light was too dim to identify Deeb, wasn't it?" She responded, "I'm sure enough that it was Deeb that I passed a lie detector test administered by the police." Deeb's attorney immediately objects and moves to strike. The trial court should
113	A burglar stole Collecta's impressionist painting valued at $400,000. Collecta, who had insured the painting for $300,000 with Artistic Insurance Co., promised to pay $25,000 to Snoop, a full-time investigator for Artistic, if he effected the return of the painting to her in good condition. By company rules, Artistic permits its investigators to accept and retain rewards from policyholders for the recovery of insured property. Snoop, by long and skillful detective work, recovered the picture and returned it undamaged to Collecta. If Collecta refuses to pay Snoop anything, and he sues her for $25,000, what is the probable result under the prevailing modern rule?
114	A farmer conveyed a 60-acre parcel of land to a rancher. A private gravel road ran through the center of the parcel. The southern half consisted of arable land, which the farmer, and later the rancher, used for farming. The northern half was undeveloped woodland. The rancher never used the northern half for timbering or for anything else. On very rare occasions, the rancher would take a walk in the woods, but outside of those occasions she never set foot on the northern half. Fifteen years after the farmer conveyed the parcel to the rancher, a landowner appeared, claiming ownership of the northern half of the parcel. Unbeknownst to either the farmer or the rancher, the landowner's name had been forged on the deed purporting to convey the parcel to the farmer, and the landowner was, in fact, the true owner of the property at that time. The state in which the parcel is located has a 10-year statutory adverse possession period. The landowner admits that the rancher now has title to the southern half of the parcel by adverse possession. In an action to quiet title, the court will determine that the northern half of the parcel belongs to:
115	On October 1, a siding installer sent a letter to a builder stating, "I am offering to install siding on one or up to all of the 12 houses that you are currently building. This offer remains open until November 1." On October 13, the builder e-mailed the installer, "We accept your offer with respect to the house on Main Street." There was only one house on Main Street that the builder was constructing, so the installer promptly began the siding installation. On October 25, the installer telephoned the builder to inform him that she had accepted other work and so would not be able to install siding on the builder's other houses. The builder thereafter faxed the installer, "We would like you to do the siding on the other houses." In an action by the builder against the installer for breach of contract, the builder will probably:
116	On November 15, Joiner in a signed writing contracted with Galley for an agreed price to personally remodel Galley's kitchen according to specifications provided by Galley, and to start work on December 1. Joiner agreed to provide all materials for the job in addition to all of the labor required. For this question only, assume that on November 26 Joiner without legal excuse repudiated the contract and that Galley, after a reasonable and prolonged effort, could not find anyone to remodel his kitchen for a price approximating the price agreed to by Joiner. If one year later Galley brings an action for specific performance against Joiner, which of the following will provide Joiner with the best defense?
117	A city amended its ordinance to require that "adult theaters" could not be located either within 100 feet of each other or within 500 feet of any residential area. This zoning requirement was passed to protect the residential character of neighborhoods from destruction. A company owns two adult theaters in the city. One is about 1,000 feet from another adult theater. The second theater is adjacent to a residential area, in violation of the zoning ordinance. The company has filed an action to have the zoning requirement declared unconstitutional. The court should hold that the zoning ordinance is:
118	A 10-year-old boy playing with his friends at an abandoned construction site was struck in the face by a 10-year-old girl wielding a "sword" (a piece of sheet metal left as scrap by the builders). The blow seriously injured the boy's eye. The boy's parents brought an action against the girl and her parents for negligence and intentional tort. The insurance company representing the girl's family raised the defense of contributory negligence as to the negligence cause of action, alleging that the boy was engaged in a mock battle with the girl with his own pretend "sword," another piece of metal. When the court instructs the jury as to the standard to be applied to the boy's conduct, it should state that:
119	During the defendant's trial for embezzlement, the defense calls a witness to testify as to the defendant's reputation for honesty and veracity. The prosecution objects. Should the court allow the testimony?
120	Which of the following acts would be improper for the United States Senate to perform?
121	The United States Department of Energy regularly transports nuclear materials through Centerville on the way to a nuclear weapons processing plant it operates in a nearby state. The city of Centerville recently adopted an ordinance prohibiting the transportation of any nuclear materials in or through the city. The ordinance declares that its purpose is to protect the health and safety of the residents of that city. May the Department of Energy continue to transport these nuclear materials through the city of Centerville?
122	The constitution of State X authorizes a fivemember state reapportionment board to redraw state legislative districts every ten years. In the last state legislative reapportionment, the board, by a unanimous vote, divided the greater Green metropolitan area, composed of Green City and several contiguous townships, into three equally populated state legislative districts. The result of that districting was that 40% of the area's total black population resided in one of those districts, 45% of the area's total black population resided in the second of those districts, and 15% resided in the third district. Jones is black, is a registered voter, and is a resident of Green City. Jones brings suit in an appropriate court against the members of the state reapportionment board, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief that would require the boundary lines of the state legislative districts in the greater Green metropolitan area to be redrawn. His only claim is that the current apportionment violates the Fifteenth Amendment and the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it improperly dilutes the voting power of the blacks who reside in that area. If no federal statute is applicable, which of the following facts, if proven, would most strongly support the validity of the action of the state reapportionment board?
123	Dan entered the police station and announced that he wanted to confess to a murder. The police advised Dan of the Miranda warnings, and Dan signed a written waiver. Dan described the murder in detail and pinpointed the location where a murder victim had been found a few weeks before. Later, a courtappointed psychiatrist determined that Dan was suffering from a serious mental illness that interfered with his ability to make rational choices and to understand his rights and that the psychosis had induced his confession. Dan's confession is
124	The Sports Championship Revenue Enhancement Act is a federal statute that was enacted as part of a comprehensive program to eliminate the federal budget deficit. That act imposed, for a period of five years, a 50% excise tax on the price of tickets to championship sporting events. Such events included the World Series, the Super Bowl, major college bowl games, and similar championship sports events. This federal tax is probably
125	The President of the United States recognizes the country of Ruritania and undertakes diplomatic relations with its government through the Secretary of State. Ruritania is governed by a repressive totalitarian government. In an appropriate federal court, Dunn brings a suit against the President and Secretary of State to set aside this action on the ground that it is inconsistent with the principles of our constitutional form of government. Dunn has a lucrative contract with the United States Department of Commerce to provide commercial information about Ruritania. The contract expressly terminates, however, "when the President recognizes the country of Ruritania and undertakes diplomatic relations with its government." Which of the following is the most proper disposition of the Dunn suit by the federal court?
126	Responding to County's written advertisement for bids, Tyres was the successful bidder for the sale of tires to County for County's vehicles. Tyres and County entered into a signed, written agreement that specified, "It is agreed that Tyres will deliver all tires required by this agreement to County, in accordance with the attached bid form and specifications, for a one-year period beginning September 1, 1990." Attached to the agreement was a copy of the bid form and specifications. In the written advertisement to which Tyres had responded, but not in the bid form, County had stated, "Multiple awards may be issued if they are in the best interests of County." No definite quantity of tires to be bought by County from Tyres was specified in any of these documents. In January 1991, Tyres learned that County was buying some of its tires from one of Tyres's competitors. Contending that the Tyres-County agreement was a requirements contract, Tyres sued County for the damages caused by County's buying some of its tires from the competitor. If County defends by offering proof of the advertisement concerning the possibility of multiple awards, should the court admit the evidence?
127	A brother and a sister each hold an undivided one-half interest in a tract of land. By the terms of their agreement, each has the right to possess all portions of the property and neither has the right to exclusive possession of any part. The brother wrongfully ousts the sister from the property. In an action against the brother, the sister can recover:
128	A man was hired as a registered nurse by a hospital operated by the county and was given an information booklet explaining that during the first nine months of employment he would be on probationary status and could be dismissed for any reason and without an explanation. After six months, he was notified by hospital administrators that he was being dismissed. If he had been employed for over nine months, hospital regulations provided that he could be dismissed only for cause and after notice and a hearing. Which of the following, if true, most strongly supports the man's dismissal without notice or hearing?
129	Three states, East Winnetka, Midland, and West Hampton, are located next to one another in that order. The states of East Winnetka and West Hampton permit the hunting and trapping of snipe, but the state of Midland strictly forbids these activities in order to protect snipe, a rare species of animal, from extinction. The state of Midland has a state statute that provides, "Possession of snipe traps is prohibited. Any game warden finding a snipe trap within the state shall seize and destroy it." Snipe traps cost about $15 each. Prentis is a resident of West Hampton and an ardent snipe trapper. She drove her car to East Winnetka to purchase a new improved snipe trap from a manufacturer there. In the course of her trip back across Midland with the trap in her car, Prentis stopped in a Midland state park to camp for a few nights. While she was in that park, a Midland game warden saw the trap, which was visible on the front seat of her car. The warden seized the trap and destroyed it in accordance with the Midland statute after Prentis admitted that the seized item was a prohibited snipe trap. No federal statutes or federal administrative regulations apply. For this question only, assume that a valid federal administrative rule, adopted under a federal consumer product safety act, regulates the design of snipe traps. The rule was issued to prevent traps from causing injury to human beings, e.g., by pinching fingers while persons were setting the traps. No other federal law applies. Which of the following best states the effect of the federal rule on the Midland state statute?
130	In a single writing, Painter contracted with Farmer to paint three identical barns on her rural estate for $2,000 each. The contract provided for Farmer's payment of $6,000 upon Painter's completion of the work on all three barns. Painter did not ask for any payment when the first barn was completely painted, but she demanded $4,000 after painting the second barn. Is Farmer obligated to make the $4,000 payment?
131	A plaintiff sued a defendant over a claimed debt. At the trial, the plaintiff established the existence of the debt and testified that he never received payment. In response, the defendant presents evidence sufficient to establish that she took her check to the post office and sent it to the plaintiff's proper address by certified mail. The defendant offers a certified mail receipt with an illegible signature, which she claims is the plaintiff's signature. The defendant also presents evidence that her basement flooded on March 28, and she claims that she cannot produce a canceled check because her box of canceled checks was destroyed from the water damage. Evidence is also presented that, due to a computer glitch, the defendant's bank cannot reproduce her checking account records for the months of February and March. After the defendant's testimony:
132	A former college baseball player who played in the College World Series 20 years ago was named in a radio broadcast as committing a key error that cost his team the championship. In fact, it was another ballplayer who committed the error. If the ballplayer brings a defamation action against the broadcaster and the court finds that he was defamed, to what damages would he be entitled?
133	A building contractor sued a homeowner for failure to pay on a small cost-plus construction contract. At trial, the contractor, who personally supervised all of the work, seeks to testify to what he remembers about the amount of pipe used, the number of workers used on the job, and the number of hours spent. The homeowner objects on the ground that the contractor had routinely recorded these facts in notebooks, which are in the contractor's possession. The contractor's testimony is:
134	On March 15, a vineyardist entered into a written agreement with a winery that provided that the vineyardist would sell 1,600 tons of tokay grapes to the winery for $750 per ton, delivery to be no later than November 1 of the same year. By November 1, the vineyardist had delivered only 700 tons of grapes and had informed the winery by fax that she had used the remainder of her crop in the production of wine for her own shop. The winery purchased an additional 900 tons of tokay grapes from other growers at the then-prevailing market price of $800 per ton. The vineyardist has submitted an invoice to the marketing department of the winery for $525,000. Ignoring incidental costs of cover, the winery should:
135	A woman was arrested outside of a house shortly after she had broken in and stolen some jewelry. She was indicted for larceny and later for burglary. She was tried on the larceny indictment and convicted. Thereafter, she was brought to trial on the burglary indictment. Relying on the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Constitution, the woman moves to dismiss the indictment. Her motion should be:
136	A stagehand decided to play a practical joke on an actor. The stagehand went to the storage room where stage props were stored and took what he believed to be a stage gun from the locker where such guns were kept. In fact, a week before, an actress had put her real pistol in the stage gun locker and borrowed the stage gun for an amateur theatrical her church group was putting on. The actress had forgotten to remove the bullets that her husband always kept in the gun. The stagehand went into the actor's dressing room and yelled, "You've stolen the part that I always wanted to play, now die for it!" The actor knew that the stagehand liked to play practical jokes, and, after an initial frightened reaction, the actor broke out laughing. The stagehand laughed too, shouted, "Bang, you're dead!" and pulled the trigger. A bullet hit the actor in the heart, killing him. Which of the following best describes the stagehand's criminal liability?
137	On a wholly random basis, a state agency has given a few probationary employees who were not rehired at the end of their probationary period a statement of reasons and an opportunity for a hearing, but the agency has very rarely done so. No statute or rule of the agency required such a statement of reasons or a hearing. The employment of a probationary employee was terminated without a statement of reasons or an opportunity for a hearing. The agency did not even consider whether it should give him either. A suit by the employee requesting a statement of reasons and a hearing will probably be:
138	The plaintiff sued the defendant for making a slanderous statement that greatly embarrassed the plaintiff. The defendant denied that he ever made such a statement. At trial, the plaintiff called a witness to the stand, and the witness testified that he heard the defendant make the statement on August 4. The defendant discredited the witness, and the plaintiff offers evidence of the witness's good reputation for truthfulness. The rehabilitation is most likely to be permitted if the discrediting evidence by the defendant was testimony that:
139	Carr ran into and injured Pedersen, a pedestrian. With Carr in his car were Wanda and Walter Passenger. Passerby saw the accident and called the police department, which sent Sheriff to investigate. All of these people are available as potential witnesses in the case of Pedersen v. Carr. Pedersen alleges that Carr, while drunk, struck Pedersen who was in a duly marked crosswalk. Pedersen's counsel wants to have Sheriff testify to the following statement made to him by Walter Passenger, out of the presence of Carr: "We were returning from a party at which we had all been drinking." The trial judge should rule this testimony
140	A written contract was entered into between Bouquet, a financier-investor, and Vintage Corporation, a winery and grape-grower. The contract provided that Bouquet would invest $1,000,000 in Vintage for its capital expansion and, in return, that Vintage, from grapes grown in its famous vineyards, would produce and market at least 500,000 bottles of wine each year for five years under the label "Premium Vintage-Bouquet' The contract included provisions that the parties would share equally the profits and losses from the venture and that, if feasible, the wine would be distributed by Vintage only through Claret, a wholesale distributor of fine wines. Neither Bouquet nor Vintage had previously dealt with Claret. Claret learned of the contract two days later from reading a trade newspaper. In reliance thereon, he immediately hired an additional sales executive and contracted for enlargement of his wine storage and display facility. For this question only, assume the following facts. Amicusbank lent Bouquet $200,000 and Bouquet executed a written instrument providing that Amicusbank "is entitled to collect the debt from my share of the profits, if any, under the Vintage-Bouquet contract" Amicusbank gave prompt notice of this transaction to Vintage. If Vintage thereafter refuses to account for any profits to Amicusbank and Amicusbank sues Vintage for Bouquet's share of profits then realized, Vintage's strongest argument in defense is that
141	Six years ago, Oscar, owner of Blackacre in fee simple, executed and delivered to Albert an instrument in the proper form of a warranty deed, purporting to convey Blackacre to "Albert and his heirs." At that time, Albert was a widower who had one child, Donna. Three years ago, Albert executed and delivered to Bea an instrument in the proper form of a warranty deed, purporting to convey Blackacre to "Bea." Donna did not join in the deed. Bea was and still is unmarried and childless. The only possibly applicable statute in the jurisdiction states that any deed will be construed to convey the grantor's entire estate, unless expressly limited. Last month, Albert died, never having remarried. Donna is his only heir. Blackacre is now owned by
142	Supermarket is in a section of town where there are sometimes street fights and where pedestrians are occasionally the victims of pickpockets and muggers. In recognition of the unusual number of robberies in the area, the supermarket posted signs in the store and in its parking lot that read: Warning: There are pickpockets and muggers at work in this part of the city. Supermarket is not responsible for the acts of criminals. One evening, Lorner drove to Supermarket to see about a special on turkeys that Supermarket was advertising. She decided that the turkeys were too large and left the store without purchasing anything. In the parking lot, she was attacked by an unknown man who raped her and then ran away. If Lorner sues Supermarket, the result should be for the
143	In preparation for a mountain-climbing expedition, Alper purchased the necessary climbing equipment from Outfitters, Inc., a retail dealer in sporting goods. A week later, Alper fell from a rock face when a safety device he had purchased from Outfitters malfunctioned because of a defect in its manufacture. Thereafter, Rollins was severely injured when he tried to reach and give assistance to Alper on the ledge to which Alper had fallen. Rollins's injury was not caused by any fault on his own part. If Rollins brings an action against Outfitters, Inc., to recover damages for his injuries, will Rollins prevail?
144	The defendant was on trial on a hit and run charge, whereby the prosecution asserted that the defendant's vehicle struck and injured an elderly pedestrian, and then the defendant sped away from the scene of the accident without stopping to assess the pedestrian's injuries or to render assistance. The defendant took the stand and denied the charge. A priest is ready to testify that he has known the defendant for 12 years, that the defendant has performed many charitable acts, and that the defendant is a highly responsible person who would not run away from his obligations by leaving the scene of an accident. If the prosecution objects to the priest's proposed testimony, should the court bar the priest from testifying?
145	A woman belonged to an extremist political group that advocated the overthrow of the United States government. Among the woman's grievances against current government was a belief that young people were being brainwashed by public school curricula. To end this practice, the woman decided to run for the local school board in the next general election so that she would have a voice in future curricula decisions. The election laws of the city where the woman resided required all candidates for the school board to sign a loyalty oath and file it with the town clerk in order to have their names placed on the ballot for the next school board election. When the woman arrived at the clerk's office to file her candidacy, she was informed of the loyalty oath requirement and was shown the oath. The woman read the oath and objected to the requirement that she sign it. Which of the following statements is correct as to whether the city may constitutionally require the woman to sign the oath in order to have her name placed on the ballot?
146	A state statute provides that persons moving into a community to attend a college on a full-time basis may not vote in any elections for local or state officials that are held in that community. Instead, the statute provides that for voting purposes all such persons will retain their residence in the community from which they came. In that state the age of majority is 18. Which of the following is the strongest argument to demonstrate the unconstitutionality of this state statute?
147	In a fraud trial, the prosecution alleges that the defendant invited the victims to become local investors/distributors for a supposed cosmetics manufacturer. The defendant claims she was brought into the scheme by the purported head of the manufacturer's sales department and was just following instructions with no knowledge of the fraud. The prosecution intends to call a witness to testify that the defendant convinced him to invest in a similar scheme involving household products five years ago. Should the trial court admit this evidence over the defendant's objection?
148	A man parked his car on a city street and entered a local tavern. While the man was inside, vandals broke the ignition motor on his car and smashed the taillights. Later that night the man left the tavern and attempted to start his car, but was unable to because of the vandals' actions, which he had not been aware of. Police in a patrolling squad car noticed him entering the car and attempting to start it. When the man got out of the car, the police approached him and asked him to identify himself. When he refused, he was arrested and charged with attempting to drive an automobile at night without functioning taillights. The man's best defense is:
149	In exchange for a valid and sufficient consideration, Goodbar orally promised Walker, who had no car and wanted a minivan, "to pay to anyone from whom you buy a minivan within the next six months the full purchase-price thereof." Two months later, Walker bought a used minivan on credit from Minivanity Fair, Inc., for $8,000. At the time, Minivanity Fair was unaware of Goodbar's earlier promise to Walker, but learned of it shortly after the sale. Can Minivanity Fair enforce Goodbar's promise to Walker?
150	Carr ran into and injured Pedersen, a pedestrian. With Carr in his car were Wanda and Walter Passenger. Passerby saw the accident and called the police department, which sent Sheriff to investigate. All of these people are available as potential witnesses in the case of Pedersen v. Carr. Pedersen alleges that Carr, while drunk, struck Pedersen who was in a duly marked crosswalk. Pedersen's counsel wants to introduce testimony from Sheriff concerning a discussion between Sheriff and Passerby at the police station after the accident, when Passerby excitedly exclaimed, "Pedersen ran out in the street and was not in the crosswalk!" Sheriff duly recorded the statement in an official police report. The trial judge should rule Sheriff's oral testimony
151	At the trial of Davis for a murder that occurred in Newtown, the prosecution called Waite, who testified that she saw Davis kill the victim. Davis believed that Waite was 600 miles away in Old Town, engaged in the illegal sale of narcotics, on the day in question. On cross-examination by Davis, Waite was asked whether she had in fact sold narcotics in Old Town on that date. Waite refused to answer on the ground of self-incrimination. The judge, over the prosecutor's objection, ordered that if Waite did not testify, her direct testimony should be stricken. The order to testify or have the testimony stricken can best be supported on the basis that
152	Some teenage boys on spring break were canoeing on a river when their canoe overturned. A nearby fisherman overheard the teens' cries for help and immediately dove into the river to rescue them. The fisherman hit his head on some hidden rocks and suffered a head injury. If the fisherman sues the teens to recover damages and prevails, it will be because:
153	A federal district court judge was accused of misconduct in office and was impeached by the House of Representatives. At trial in the United States Senate, the judge was convicted and removed from office. Nevertheless, the President directed the Attorney General to institute criminal proceedings against the judge. After presentation to a federal grand jury, an indictment was issued against the judge and signed by the Attorney General. At the opening of his trial, the judge moved to have the indictment dismissed. Most likely the trial judge would:
154	Select from the choices (A-D) the most serious offense of which the defendant could be properly convicted. Defendant, an avid fan of his home town football team, shot at the leg ofa star playerfor a rival team, intending to injure his leg enough to hospitalize for a few weeks, but not to kill him. The victim died of loss of blood.
155	Miller is tried for armed robbery of the First Bank of City. Miller testified on direct examination that he had never been in the First Bank of City. His counsel asks, "What, if anything, did you tell the police when you were arrested?" If his answer would be, "I told them I had never been in the bank," this answer would be
156	Patten suffered from a serious, though not immediately life-threatening, impairment of his circulatory system. Patten's cardiologist recommended a cardiac bypass operation and referred Patten to Dr. Cutter. Cutter did not inform Patten of the 2% risk of death associated with this operation. Cutter defended his decision not to mention the risk statistics to Patten because "Patten was a worrier and it would significantly lessen his chances of survival to be worried about the nonsurvival rate." Cutter successfully performed the bypass operation and Patten made a good recovery. However, when Patten learned of the 2% risk of death associated with the operation, he was furious that Cutter had failed to disclose this information to him. If Patten asserts a claim against Cutter based on negligence, will Patten prevail?
157	A homeowner entered into a written agreement with a contractor whereby the contractor agreed to completely remodel the homeowner's bathroom "to her specifications" at a cost of $10,000. The homeowner's specifications were highly detailed and required custom-made fixtures that would not be usable in other bathroom remodeling jobs. The contractor ordered the custom-made fixtures and paid $4,000 for them when they were delivered to his place of business. Figuring up the cost of the fixtures and labor, the contractor estimated that he would make a total profit of $2,000 on the job after payment for materials and workers. Before the contractor began work on the project, but after he had paid for the fixtures, the homeowner told the contractor that she had had a change of heart and would probably be selling the house the following year, and so would not need a custom bathroom. The contractor made no attempt to sell the fixtures to another contractor and filed suit against the homeowner for damages. The contractor is likely to recover:
158	To stabilize state corn prices, a state purchased large quantities of corn from resident farmers and converted the corn into biodegradable plastics. The state then sold the plastics to state residents at cost and to out-of-state residents at cost plus 25%. An out-of-state corporation purchased biodegradable plastics from the state at a cost substantially below the price other companies charge. Nevertheless, the corporation believes that it is unconstitutional for the state to charge out-of-state purchasers more than resident purchasers. The out-of-state corporation, therefore, brings suit in federal court challenging the state pricing scheme. Assuming that the court has jurisdiction, should it uphold the constitutionality of the pricing scheme?
159	The owner of several radio stations throughout the Midwest purchased land in a small Midwest town for the purpose of building another radio station. He entered into a written contract with a contractor to build a studio and broadcast transmitter on the property for $3 million. In response to an engineering survey undertaken before the contract was executed, the contract contained a clause providing that the underground cables be laid in a path that avoided an identified area of magnetized rock, because under certain conditions, such as magnetic storms generated by sunspot activity, a higher than normal level of interference with the radio broadcast signals would occur if the cables were laid there. After the contractor finished the job, the radio station owner discovered that the contractor had laid a portion of the underground cables through a patch of magnetized rock. Despite the defect, the studio and broadcasting transmitter are now worth about $4 million. Without the defect, their value would be $100,000 more. The radio station owner contracted with an electrical contractor to reroute the cables around the magnetized rock for a cost of $50,000. How much is the original contractor entitled to collect from the radio station owner?
160	Sue owned a five-acre tract of land, one acre of which had previously been owned by Opal, but to which Sue had acquired title by adverse possession. Sue contracted to convey the full five-acre tract to Peg, but the contract did not specify the quality of title Sue would convey. At closing, Peg refused the tendered deed and demanded return of her earnest money. Suppose Peg pays the purchase price and accepts a deed. Subsequently, Sue's title to the one acre proves inadequate and Opal ejects Peg from that acre. Peg sues Sue for damages. Which of the following statements applies most accurately to the determination of Peg's rights?
161	A six-year-old girl went with her father to look at Christmas decorations in the neighborhood. One house had a variety of displays in the yard, including a large mechanical Santa Claus figure that waved its arm and moved its head. While the father was talking to the homeowner about his electricity bill, the girl climbed up on the Santa. It toppled over and she hit her head on the ground, suffering a serious injury. The girl, through her guardian ad litem, brought a products liability action based on strict liability against the manufacturer of the Santa figure in a jurisdiction that does not apply its comparative negligence rules to strict liability actions. Which of the following would provide the best defense for the manufacturer?
162	Abel owned Blackacre in fee simple. Three years ago, Abel and Betty agreed to a month- to-month tenancy with Betty paying Abel rent each month. After six months of Betty's occupancy, Abel suggested to Betty that she could buy Blackacre for a monthly payment of no more than her rent. Abel and Betty orally agreed that Betty would pay $25,000 in cash, the annual real estate taxes, the annual fire insurance premiums, and the costs of maintaining Blackacre, plus the monthly mortgage payments that Abel owed on Blackacre. They further orally agreed that within six years Betty could pay whatever mortgage balances were then due and Abel would give her a warranty deed to the property. Betty's average monthly payments did turn out to be about the same as her monthly rent. Betty fully complied with all of the obligations she had undertaken. She made some structural modifications to Blackacre. Blackacre is now worth 50% more than it was when Abel and Betty made their oral agreement. Betty made her financing arrangements and was ready to complete the purchase of Blackacre, but Abel refused to close. Betty brought an appropriate action for specific performance against Abel to enforce the agreement. The court should rule for
163	A defendant was on trial for murder. At the trial, the defendant put forth the defense of selfdefense, claiming that the victim was about to kill him when he shot the victim. To help establish that he was in fear of the victim, the defendant called a witness to testify that she heard a third party tell the defendant that the victim, "is a mean, vicious killer; he has murdered three people in the past year."
164	Ames had painted Bell's house under a contract which called for payment of $2,000. Bell, contending in good faith that the porch had not been painted properly, refused to pay anything. On June 15, Ames mailed a letter to Bell stating, "I am in serious need of money. Please send the $2,000 to me before July 1." On June 18, Bell replied, "I will settle for $1,800 provided you agree to repaint the porch." Ames did not reply to this letter. Thereafter Bell mailed a check for $1,800 marked "Payment in full on the Ames-Bell painting contract as per letter dated June 18." Ames received the check on June 30. Because he was badly in need of money, Ames cashed the check without objection and spent the proceeds but has refused to repaint the porch. After cashing the check, Ames sued Bell for $200. Ames probably will
165	A skier broke his leg when he was knocked down by the chair lift as he tried to avoid other skiers who had fallen off while disembarking. The ski resort employee operating the lift had not been paying attention and had failed to stop the lift. Ski patrol personnel placed the skier on a stretcher, which they then hooked up to a snowmobile to bring him down the mountain. The route down ran along the edge of a ski trail. Midway down, a novice snowboarder tried to see how close he could come to the stretcher without hitting it, but he lost control and landed on top of the skier's leg, damaging it further. The skier filed a lawsuit against the snowboarder and the resort in a jurisdiction that has adopted a comparative contribution system in joint and several liability cases. At trial, the skier's physician testified that the skier's leg was permanently disabled, but that neither injury, by itself, would have caused the permanent disability and it was impossible to quantify how much each injury contributed to the disability. The jury determined that the damages from the permanent disability equaled $2 million, and that the snowboarder and the resort were each 50% at fault. What amount of damages can the skier recover from the snowboarder for his permanent disability?
166	A testator wanted to give his home to his brother. The testator executed a warranty deed conveying the home to his brother. The testator then wrote a letter to his brother saying, "Dear brother, my home is now yours." He put the letter and deed in an envelope and wrote the following on the outside of the envelope and signed it: "Cousin, you are to give this deed to my brother when I die. Until then, you should safeguard this envelope and the documents inside." The testator delivered these items to his cousin and continued to live in his home by himself. Two years later, the testator executed a will leaving all of his property to his sister. Seven years later, the testator died. Shortly thereafter, the cousin delivered the envelope containing the deed to the testator's brother, who promptly recorded the deed. The testator's will has been admitted to probate and his executor has brought an appropriate action against the brother to determine the title to the testator's home. The court should rule:
167	A farmer in a rural area contracted with a power company to erect wind turbines on his property. While zoning codes permitted this use of the property, the foundation supports for the turbines were not at the depth required by a code provision intended to ensure that large structures could withstand hurricane-force winds. When the wind turbines became operational, the noise bothered the farmer's neighbor, although other neighbors the same distance away were not bothered. The neighbor, who was a commercial beekeeper, also discovered that his bees were producing less honey after the turbines began operating. If the beekeeper brings a private nuisance action against the farmer, is he is likely to prevail?
168	Orris had title to Brownacre in fee simple. Without Orris' knowledge, Hull entered Brownacre in 1950 and constructed an earthen dam across a watercourse. The earthen dam trapped water that Hull used to water a herd of cattle he owned. After 12 years of possession of Brownacre, Hull gave possession of Brownacre to Burns. At the same time, Hull also purported to transfer his cattle and all his interests in the dam and water to Burns by a document that was sufficient as a bill of sale to transfer personal property but was insufficient as a deed to transfer real property. One year later, Burns entered into a lease with Orris to lease Brownacre for a period of five years. After the end of the five-year term of the lease, Burns remained on Brownacre for an additional three years and then left Brownacre. At that time Orris conveyed Brownacre by a quitclaim deed to Powell. The period of time to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is 10 years. After Orris's conveyance to Powell, title to the earthen dam was in
169	A buyer contracted to purchase a home from a real estate developer for $700,000, and made a down payment on the purchase in the amount of $100,000. The buyer's employer provided $100,000 of the purchase price, by giving the buyer a loan and taking a mortgage. Because of the down payment, the employer agreed to an additional loan provision, whereby the buyer could receive up to $100,000 in future financing, subject to the same terms as the first $100,000, if the buyer needed extra cash. The developer loaned $500,000 to the buyer to finance the remainder of the purchase price, and in return took a mortgage on the property. Both mortgages were recorded the day after closing. One week later, a bank obtained a judgment against the buyer for a delinquent credit card balance. The bank recorded its judgment lien the next day. Another month after that, the buyer incurred some extraordinary medical expenses, and asked the employer for another $100,000, which the employer provided and added onto the principal balance the buyer owed on the loan. Finally, six months later, the buyer asked the developer to change the terms of the loan, so that the buyer would have more time to pay. The developer and the buyer agreed that the buyer could have an additional five years to pay the balance of the loan, but the interest rate would increase by an extra percentage point. Shortly thereafter, the buyer lost his job and defaulted on all of his payments. The employer brought an action to foreclose its mortgage. Regarding the distribution of the proceeds of an eventual sheriff's sale ofthe property, which of the following statements is true?
170	A state statute permits the state to seize and dispose of real property that was used to commit or facilitate the commission of a felony drug offense. After a drug dealer's arrest for selling cocaine out of his home, a felony, the state instituted an action of forfeiture against the drug dealer's house and property. After notice to the drug dealer and a hearing, a judge granted the order and the state seized the property. Six months later, after the time for any appeals had expired, the property was sold at a public auction to a third party. It was only when the third party brought an action to quiet title that a bank holding a properly recorded mortgage on the drug dealer's property learned of the forfeiture. Because the bank's mortgage payments were automatically deducted from an account the drug dealer had under a different name, no one at the bank was aware that the property had been seized. The only notice provided to parties other than the drug dealer was a public notice published for three weeks in a general circulation newspaper. The bank defends the quiet title action on the ground that it did not receive the notice required under the United States Constitution to protect its interest in the property. If the court rules that the bank's rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment were violated by the state's seizure of the property, it will be because:
171	The United States was involved in a dispute with a small island nation over the ownership of an archipelago. On discovering that the archipelago was rich in oil, the President announced that he would appoint an ambassador to negotiate a treaty with the island nation to jointly exploit the oil reserve. A majority of Senators believed that the island clearly belonged to the United States and did not want to negotiate with the island nation. They passed a resolution requiring the President to include a Senator in his diplomatic mission to ensure that the Senate's view was presented in any negotiation with the island nation. What is the strongest constitutional ground for the President's refusal to do so?
172	Pratt sued Danvers for injuries suffered by Pratt when their automobiles collided. At trial, Pratt offers into evidence a properly authenticated letter from Danvers that says, "Your claim seems too high, but, because I might have been a little negligent, I'm prepared to offer you half of what you ask" The letter is
173	A woman called the police to report that she had been raped. She gave the police a detailed description of her attacker, and they picked up a man who matched the description who was found near the site of the alleged attack. The police took the man to the police station and read him his Miranda warnings. The man asked for a public defender to be appointed. Before the public defender arrived, the woman came to the police station and was told there would be a lineup as soon as the suspect's lawyer arrived. On the way to the viewing room, the woman passed a holding cell where the man was being held. She pointed at him and said loudly, "That's the man who attacked me!" The man did not respond in any way. The woman later picked the man out of a lineup. At the trial, if the prosecutor wishes to introduce evidence that the man said nothing when the woman confronted him, would such evidence be admissible?
174	In a trial to a jury, Owner proved that Power Company's negligent maintenance of a transformer caused a fire that destroyed his restaurant. The jury returned a verdict for Owner in the amount of $450,000 for property loss and $500,000 for emotional distress. The trial judge entered judgment in those amounts. Power Company appealed that part of the judgment awarding $500,000 for emotional distress. On appeal, the judgment should be
175	A wife found some letters in her husband's dresser that disclosed that her husband was having an extended affair with her best friend. Furious, the wife purchased a handgun and waited for the right moment. At a barbecue celebrating her friend's birthday, the wife gave the gun to the friend's 10-year-old nephew. She told the nephew that it was a toy gun that would shoot out a Happy Birthday flag and that he should shoot his aunt with it as a joke. The nephew took the gun, pointed it at his aunt, and pulled the trigger. However, the nephew's aim was faulty, and when the gun discharged the bullet struck the husband, killing him. Which of the following best describes the crime or crimes of which the wife can be properly convicted?
176	A licensed doctor saw an unconscious pedestrian bleeding and lying on the shoulder of a highway. Two years earlier, she had witnessed a similar scene and failed to stop. The earlier pedestrian had wound up dying, and the doctor had promised that victim's wife that if she ever came upon a similar victim, she would stop to help. True to her word, the doctor stopped her car, dashed to the pedestrian's side, and frantically (yet competently) rendered emergency medical care. The pedestrian was stabilized because of the doctor's quick actions and survived. He eventually made a full recovery. The best argument for the doctor recovering the reasonable cost of her medical care from the pedestrian is:
177	A privately owned corporation contracted with the United States to construct a dam across a river in a state other than that in which it was incorporated. The state imposed a gross receipts tax on all business conducted within it. The state sued the corporation to collect that tax on the receipts the corporation received under this federal contract. No federal statutes or administrative rules are applicable, and the contract between the United States and the corporation does not mention state taxation. The court should hold the state tax, as applied here, to be:
178	Acting on an anonymous telephone call, the police went to a woman's apartment, pounded on the door, and demanded to search it for possible stolen property. The woman refused. The police then kicked open the door and placed the woman under arrest. The woman then offered to give the officers some inside information in exchange for her release. Before she could say anything else, the woman was given Miranda warnings by the police. Thereafter, she told the police that she knew of a large supply of stolen property stored at a nearby warehouse and said that she and a friend had been selling the stolen property out of the warehouse for years. The police raided the warehouse and recovered the stolen property. The woman was charged with conspiracy to sell stolen property and for possession of stolen property. At her trial, the woman moved to suppress the statements. Which of the following is the woman's best argument in support of the motion to suppress?

180	A defendant got into a fight with his former roommate over some money that the defendant claimed his old roommate owed for some long distance telephone calls. When his old roommate refused to pay the money, the defendant took two tickets that the roommate had purchased for a playoff college basketball game, intending to give them back the day after the game. The defendant is charged with larceny. Most likely the defendant will be found:
181	The plaintiff used aluminum brackets in her business. On the telephone listed as hers in the telephone book, the plaintiff received a call in which the caller said, "I own the hardware store downtown. We have a special on aluminum brackets this week at 30% off." The plaintiff ordered brackets from the caller. When the brackets were never delivered, she sued the defendant, owner of the hardware store, for breach of contract. At trial, the defendant, who denies having made the telephone call, objects to the plaintiff's testimony concerning it. When asked, the plaintiff testifies that, aside from the telephone call, she had never heard the defendant speak until she met him in the judge's chambers before the trial and that, in her opinion, the voice on the telephone was the defendant's. The strongest argument for admission of the plaintiff's testimony concerning the telephone call is that:
182	The defendant was being sued for striking and seriously injuring a child with his car one evening while the child was playing in the street near the curb. At trial, the attorney for the child's parents seeks to have defendant's wife testify that he had said, "Between you and me, just before all this happened, I took a quick peek at the back seat to make sure I brought my briefcase home with me. If I had kept my eyes on the road, I never would've hit the kid." The wife was recently divorced from the defendant and eager to testify against him. The prosecution also presented evidence that, unknown to either the defendant or his wife, their neighbor overheard this conversation through her open window. Assuming a proper objection by defense attorney, will the wife be permitted to so testify?
183	To provide jobs for its citizens, stimulate future tourism, and help the environment, a state legislature enacted a statute authorizing the state's department of parks and recreation to hire up to 5,000 persons to plant trees on land in the state that has been denuded of trees by overlogging. Among other things, the statute provides that resident aliens may be employed only if no United States citizens are available to fill the necessary positions. In a challenge to the constitutionality of that provision by a plaintiff with standing to raise the claim, which of the following constitutional provisions would be most helpful to the plaintiff?
184	Dever was indicted for the murder of Vickers by poison. At trial, the prosecutor calls the county coroner, Dr. Wolfe, who is a board-certified pathologist, to testify that, in accord with good practice in her specialty, she has studied microphotographic slides, made under her supervision by medical assistants, of tissue taken from Vickers' corpse and that it is Wolfe's opinion, based on that study, that Vickers died of poisoning. The slides have not been offered in evidence. Dr. Wolfe's opinion should be
185	Plaintiff Construction Co. sued Defendant Development Co. for money owed on a cost- plus contract that required notice of proposed expenditures beyond original estimates. Defendant asserted that it never received the required notice. At trial Plaintiff calls its general manager, Witness, to testify that it is Plaintiffs routine practice to send cost overrun notices as required by the contract. Witness also offers a photocopy of the cost overrun notice letter to Defendant on which Plaintiff is relying, and which he has taken from Plaintiff's regular business files. On the issue of giving notice, the letter copy is
186	A cyclist was riding on a sidewalk when someone in a parked car suddenly opened the door of the car into her path. She swerved to avoid the car door and rode onto a landowner's property, damaging some plastic lawn ornaments of waterfowl placed in his front yard. In a suit by the landowner against the cyclist for the damage to his lawn ornaments:
187	A recent college graduate landed her dream job teaching kindergarten at the same elementary school she had attended as a child. The woman's contract provided that she would be paid $40,000 for the school year, and that she could only be fired for just cause. Days before the woman was to begin teaching, the school's principal fired the woman, without cause, so that she could hire her cousin for the job instead. The woman submitted her resume to an employment agency, but was so depressed over the loss of her dream job that she turned down another school's offer for a similar job paying a $30,000 salary, and instead spent the rest of the school year miserably unemployed. If the woman successfully sues the school for breach of contract, how much can she recover?
188	Chase, as seller, and Scott, as buyer, enter into a written contract for the sale and purchase of land which is complete in all respects except that no reference is made to the quality of title to be conveyed. Which of the following will result?
189	Desmond fell while attempting to climb a mountain, and lay unconscious and critically injured on a ledge that was difficult to reach. Pearson, an experienced mountain climber, was himself seriously injured while trying to rescue Desmond. Pearson's rescue attempt failed, and Desmond died of his injuries before he could be reached. Pearson brought an action against Desmond's estate for compensation for his injuries. In this jurisdiction, the traditional common-law rules relating to contributory negligence and assumption of risk remain in effect. Will Pearson prevail in his action against Desmond's estate?
190	A dentist rented office space in a medical building for a period of five years. The lease provided that the building's owner would maintain all common areas of the building, including the parking lot. Three years into the lease, the building was sold to an investor. The investor took subject to all of the leases, including the dentist's lease, but did not assume any of the original owner's obligations under it. Five months after the sale, a contractor, hired by the original owner, who was reconstructing the building's parking lot, walked off the job because he had not received any progress payments from either the original owner or the investor during the past five months. After notifying the original owner and the investor and receiving no response, the dentist agreed to pay the contractor $20,000 up front to finish the job. The dentist then withheld his rent payment of $2,000 for that month and brought an action against the original owner and the investor to recover the balance of the paymentto the contractor. Is either the original owner or the investor liable to the dentist?
191	A developer constructed several small stores in a commercial district. She received a bid from a contractor to install awnings on the front windows of the stores. The developer had heard that the contractor did shoddy work, but the price was right and the contractor expressly assumed all of the risk of any liability. The developer subsequently sold one of the stores to a barber. A few months later, an awning collapsed without warning, injuring a customer who was about to enter the barbershop. An investigation by the building inspector revealed that the awning collapsed because the brackets used by the contractor were cheaper and weaker than the required brackets, although they looked the same. The developer and the contractor are now both bankrupt. If the customer sues the barber for his injuries, the customer is likely to:
192	A landowner owned a large tract of land containing numerous coal mines. To finance the renovation of some of the buildings on the land, the landowner obtained a $50,000 mortgage from a bank. Shortly thereafter, the landowner conveyed the surface of the land to his sister and the mineral rights to a utility company. The bank recorded its mortgage the next day; the day after that, the utility company recorded its deed; the following day, the sister recorded her deed. None of the parties dealing with the landowner had any knowledge of the others at the time of their transactions. The jurisdiction in which the land is located has the following statute: "No conveyance or mortgage of an interest in land is valid against any subsequent purchaser for value without notice thereof whose conveyance is first recorded." If the sister brings an action to quiet title to the land, the most likely result would be:
193	Leader is a labor leader in Metropolis. Ten years ago he was divorced. Both he and his first wife have since married other persons. Recently, News, a newspaper in another city, ran a feature article on improper influences it asserted had been used by labor officials to secure favorable rulings from government officials. The story said that in 1960 Leader's first wife, with Leader's knowledge and concurrence, gave sexual favors to the mayor of Metropolis and then persuaded him to grant concessions to Leader's union, with which Metropolis was then negotiating a labor contract. The story named Leader and identified his first wife by her former and current surnames. The reporter for News believed the story to be true, since it had been related to him by two very reliable sources. Leader's first wife suffered emotional distress and became very depressed. If she asserts a claim based on defamation against News, she will
194	A homeowner called a tree trimmer to his house to trim some branches on a large pine tree in the homeowner's backyard. The tree trimmer trimmed off several large branches and pruned several others. The homeowner paid the tree trimmer, who left and did not return. A week after the tree trimmer trimmed the tree, one of the pruned branches split from the trunk of the tree and landed on a neighbor's car. If the neighbor brings suit against the tree trimmer for damage to his car, the best defense for the tree trimmer is that:
195	A buyer entered into a written contract to purchase a seller's house for $250,000. The contract called for the seller to deposIt a deed in escrow forthwith, and for payment of the purchase price and delivery of the deed through escrow within 30 days thereafter. The seller immediately deposited the deed with the escrow holder. On the 29th day, the seller was injured in a snowmobile accident and rendered comatose; he remains in this state to date. On the 30th day, the sale closed pursuant to the contract; the seller's deed was delivered to the buyer, and the $250,000 was paid over to the seller's account. The seller's incapacity:
196	A state statute provides that any teacher, guardian, therapist, school administrator, or any other person standing in loco parentis is subject to the same rights and duties as actual parents. No other statute is applicable to these facts. A residential institute for minors with mental or emotional disabilities had no fence surrounding its premises, but regular bedchecks were conducted each night to determine that all of the children were present. One night, a bedcheck determined that a 12-year-old resident of the institute was absent. The security guard who conducted the bedcheck immediately reported to the director of the institute that the boy was missing. The director initiated steps to find the boy but did not report the boy's absence to the police. Thirty-six hours after the boy ran away from the institute, he savagely beat and severely injured a six-year-old girl who lived a few blocks away from the institute. Her parents filed suit against the director on their daughter's behalf. Which party is likely to prevail in the lawsuit?
197	A homeowner was helping his neighbor clean out her garage. As the homeowner and the neighbor were moving some boards out of the garage, the neighbor ran into the overhead door's hinge, causing it to fall and hit the homeowner on his head, killing him. The homeowner's wife sued the neighbor for the wrongful death of her husband, seeking damages of $100,000. The wife, who was present when the accident occurred, is called to testify that at the time of the accident, the homeowner was carrying the boards on his shoulder, and he therefore was unable to see that the neighbor had hit the door hinges. As a witness, the wife is:
198	After drinking at his favorite bar all day long and becoming very intoxicated, the defendant pulled out a gun to reenact a scene from a movie he had seen the other day. Pointing his gun at a bystander, he slurred a line from the movie and pulled the trigger. He was shocked to see the bystander fall down dead with a bullet in him. Due to his intoxicated state, the defendant cannot remember pulling out or firing the gun. A state statute defines all murders as second degree murders unless deliberation and premeditation can be shown, in which case the crime is elevated to first degree murder. The crimes below are listed in descending order of seriousness. What is the most serious crime of which the defendant may be convicted?
199	The police suspected that Yancey, a 16-year-old high school student, had committed a series of burglaries. Two officers went to Yancey's high school and asked the principal to call Yancey out of class and to search his backpack. While the officers waited, the principal took Yancey into the hall where she asked to look in his backpack. When Yancey refused, the principal grabbed it from him, injuring Yancey's shoulder in the process. In the backpack, she found jewelry that she turned over to the officers. The officers believed that the jewelry had been taken in one of the burglaries. They arrested Yancey, took him to the station, and gave him Miranda warnings. Yancey asked to see a lawyer. The police called Yancey's parents to the station. When Yancey's parents arrived, the police asked them to speak with Yancey. They put them in a room and secretly recorded their conversation with a concealed electronic device. Yancey broke down and confessed to his parents that he had committed the burglaries. Yancey was charged with the burglaries. Assume for this question only that the court denied the motion to suppress the jewelry. Yancey moves to suppress the use of the statement Yancey made to his parents. The that best argument for excluding it would be
200	A coal company developed a new extraction process that enabled it to produce coal at marketable cost from "worn out" mines that it owned, and began operating the mines using the new process. As a cost-cutting measure that increased profits, the corporate officers knowingly permitted the new process to be utilized in such a way that federally and state mandated methane gas detection measures were not complied with, and a consequent methane explosion severely injured several miners. In addition to being prosecuted for felony violations of the methane detection statutes, the corporation and its officers were prosecuted for attempted murder. What should be the outcome of this prosecution?
201	A driver was operating her car on a city street when she was stopped by a police officer for speeding. As the police officer reached the driver's car, he saw her put something into her purse. The officer told the driver, "Ma'am, you were speeding; that's why I stopped you. I'd like your driver's license, and, by the way, what did you just put into your purse?" The driver responded, "It's just a marijuana cigarette, but don't worry, I've only had two and my driving judgment hasn't been impaired." The officer took her purse, removed the "joint," and charged the driver with possession of marijuana as well as speeding. At the driver's trial for marijuana possession, the prosecution seeks to introduce the marijuana cigarette into evidence. The driver's attorney moves to suppress the evidence. The defense motion should be:
202	Oscar, owner of Greenacre, conveyed Greenacre by quitclaim deed as a gift to Ann, who did not then record her deed. Later, Oscar conveyed Greenacre by warranty deed to Belle, who paid valuable consideration, knew nothing of Ann's claim, and promptly and properly recorded. Next, Ann recorded her deed. Then Belle conveyed Greenacre by quitclaim deed to her son Cal as a gift. When the possible conflict with Ann was discovered, Cal recorded his deed. Greenacre at all relevant times has been vacant unoccupied land. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides: "No unrecorded conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value without notice, who shall first record." No other statute is applicable. Cal has sued Ann to establish who owns Greenacre. The court will hold for
203	Late one evening, a cook at a diner coming off his shift was grabbed in the parking lot by a large man wearing a ski mask. The man threatened to kill the cook and demanded his wallet. The man then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the cook. The cook, having taken several self-defense courses, was able to fend off the man's attack. After being struck by the cook several times, the man dropped the knife and fell to the ground. The cook, angry at the assault, took the knife and stabbed the man, killing him instantly. Should the cook be convicted of murder?
204	A defendant is being tried for the murder of a bank teller, which occurred during the robbery of a bank. At trial, a witness, who knew the defendant, is called to testify that on the day after the robbery he saw the defendant buying some groceries, and when the defendant removed a large roll of money, the witness had asked, "You didn't steal that from someone, did you?" The defendant nodded. This evidence is:
205	An automobile manufacturer entered into a contract with a well-known tire distributor which provided that the distributor would deliver to the automobile manufacturer 1,000 tires on the 15th of each month for $50,000 per shipment, with payment due upon receipt. The automobile manufacturer and the tire distributor properly fulfilled their contractual obligations for two months. The day after the third tire delivery, the tire distributor's president visited the automobile manufacturer and found the automobiles produced with his company's tires to be a "disgrace." To protect the tire distributor's reputation, the president announced that he will not send any additional tire shipments. The automobile manufacturer immediately brought a breach of contract action against the tire distributor. Who will prevail?
206	A statute in the jurisdiction makes it a crime to sell ammunition to a person under the age of 18. The courts have interpreted this statute as creating a strict liability offense that does not require knowledge of the age of the purchaser and as creating vicarious liability. A 16-year-old boy, who looked four or five years older, entered a store and asked a clerk for a box of .22-caliber shells. The store owner had instructed her employees not to sell ammunition to anyone under the age of 18 and to always ask for identification. The clerk asked the boy his age. The boy said he was 20. The clerk then placed a box of shells on the counter and asked, "Anything else?" The boy said that was all he wanted but then discovered he did not have enough money to pay for the shells, so the clerk put the box back onto the shelf. If the owner of the store is charged with attempting to violate the statute, her best argument would be that:
207	A bartender diligently followed the procedure her employer set: She would ask every patron for identification regardless of how old (or young) the patron appeared to be. One day, after asking for identification, the bartender served alcohol to a minor. The identification that the minor gave to the bartender was actually issued by mistake by an appropriate state agency and appeared to show that the minor was of legal age. After another patron, an off-duty police officer, recognized the minor, the bartender was arrested for serving alcohol to a minor. In this jurisdiction, the highest state court has held that, under state law, strict liability is abolished and all crimes require a culpable mental state. The best reason for finding the bartender not guilty would be:
208	Dora, who was eight years old, went to the grocery store with her mother. Dora pushed the grocery cart while her mother put items into it. Dora's mother remained near Dora at all times. Peterson, another customer in the store, noticed Dora pushing the cart in a manner that caused Peterson no concern. A short time later, the cart Dora was pushing struck Peterson in the knee, inflicting serious injury. If Peterson brings an action, based on negligence, against Dora's mother, will Peterson prevail?
209	A statute of the state of Kiowa provided state monetary grants to private dance, theater, and opera groups located in that state. The statute required recipients of such grants to use the granted monies for the acquisition, construction, and maintenance of appropriate facilities for the public performance of their performing arts. The last section of the statute conditioned the award of each such grant on the recipient's agreement to refrain from all kinds of political lobbying calculated to secure additional tax support for the performing arts. The strongest constitutional basis for an attack upon the validity of the last section of the statute would be based upon the
210	In compliance with a federal statute that permits government agencies to sell or give away surplus government property, the Secretary of State directed that one of the State Department's surplus airplanes be given to a church. The Secretary knew that the church planned to use the plane to fly medical supplies to its missions in Third World countries. These missions provide medical assistance, but they also attempt to evangelize residents of the countries in question, and the Secretary was aware that, in addition to medical supplies, the plane might transport Bibles and religious tracts translated into local languages. Had the Secretary not ordered the plane to be given to the church, it would have been sold at a very reasonable cost to a nonprofit organization that helps teach young people the fundamentals of piloting and maintaining aircraft. Which of the following parties would be most likely to have standing to sue to prevent the Secretary of State from making the gift to the church?
211	A carpenter purchased an old house, planning to slowly fix it up. He financed the purchase by taking out a mortgage on the property with a bank, which recorded the mortgage. The carpenter purchased some custom-made windows from a retail dealer. The modern windows were easily removable from the window frames to make cleaning them easier. The carpenter had lacked sufficient funds to pay the $10,000 the dealer wanted for a complete set of new windows, so the dealer had agreed to sell the windows to the carpenter on an installment payment plan, with the windows as security. The carpenter installed the windows himself and stored the old windows in the basement of the house. The carpenter made three payments to the bank on the $30,000 mortgage, and he made two payments to the dealer on the windows. The carpenter then lost his job and ceased making payments to the bank and the dealer. The carpenter has departed to parts unknown and the dealer wishes to remove the windows from the house. The bank objects and the matter winds up in court. How should the court rule on the dealer's request to remove the windows?
212	A landowner owned a beachfront lot and home in a subdivision occupying several hundred acres near a lake. The recorded subdivision plan grants to each owner in the subdivision an easement to use the private roads therein for personal ingress and egress. Following seismic activity in the area, the level of the lake dropped substantially, exposing a considerable amount of land between the new shoreline and the old beachfront. It was judicially determined that this "new" land belonged to the county, which put portions of it up for --ale. The landowner purchased the land extending from her old property line to the new shoreline, and constructed a boat launching ramp on the new property. She then permitted persons who did not own land in the subdivision to drive through her old property to reach the boat launching ramp on her new property, and thus to utilize the lake, for a small fee. The homeowners' association brought suit against the landowner, seeking to enjoin her from using or permitting nonresidents of the subdivision from traveling its streets to reach the boat launching ramp. How should the court rule?
213	A landlord owned a three-story apartment building that had a beautiful view of the ocean over a neighbor's vacant lot. The neighbor assured the landlord that he had no plans to develop the vacant lot. Subsequently, the neighbor was killed in an automobile accident, and his will left the lot to his son. Over the landlord's objections, the son began building a 10-story office structure. Once the construction began, the contractor's workers continually swung large girders suspended from a crane over the landlord's building. The landlord complained incessantly because the tenants complained to her that the girders frightened them, but the son did nothing about it. Even when the office structure was only partially completed it put the landlord's apartment building in shadows for the greater part of the afternoon. Her apartments not only no longer had an ocean view, but were dark and devoid of sunlight. The landlord slashed her rents by 40%, but still had difficulty keeping the building fully occupied. If the landlord brings a suit seeking all available relief, a court will most likely find that she has:
214	During an action for breach of contract, the defendant testified in court that she withheld shipment of the goods because the plaintiff defrauded her. The plaintiff now wishes to sue the defendant for defamation because he can establish that this testimony was false. The plaintiff may:
215	Carr ran into and injured Pedersen, a pedestrian. With Carr in his car were Wanda and Walter Passenger. Passerby saw the accident and called the police department, which sent Sheriff to investigate. All of these people are available as potential witnesses in the case of Pedersen v. Carr. Pedersen alleges that Carr, while drunk, struck Pedersen who was in a duly marked crosswalk. On the evening of the day of the accident, Walter Passenger wrote a letter to his sister in which he described the accident. When Walter says he cannot remember some details of the accident, Pedersen's counsel seeks to show him the letter to assist him in his testimony on direct examination. The trial judge should rule this
216	Anna entered a hospital to undergo surgery and feared that she might not survive. She instructed her lawyer by telephone to prepare a deed conveying Blackacre, a large tract of undeveloped land, as a gift to her nephew, Bernard, who lived in a distant state. Her instructions were followed, and, prior to her surgery, she executed a document in a form sufficient to constitute a deed of conveyance. The deed was recorded by the lawyer promptly and properly as she instructed him to do. The recorded deed was returned to the lawyer by the land record office, Anna, in fact, recovered from her surgery and the lawyer returned the recorded deed to her. Before Anna or the lawyer thought to inform Bernard of the conveyance, Bernard was killed in an auto accident. Bernard's will left all of his estate to a satanic religious cult. Anna was very upset at the prospect of the cult's acquiring Blackacre. The local taxing authority assessed the next real property tax bill on Blackacre to Bernard's estate. Anna brought an appropriate action against Bernard's estate and the cult to set aside the conveyance to Bernard. If Anna loses, it will be because
217	A state conducted a study in which it found that many parents were moving out of certain areas of the state because they could not find affordable day care. As a result, the state legislature enacted a statute that created an agency to operate subsidized day care centers throughout these areas. These day care centers would charge parents a nominal fee compared to private day care centers in the area. A private day care center has discovered that its business has fallen off about 30% since the agency started operating a day care center in its city. It brings an action seeking to enjoin the operation of the agency. What will be the probable outcome of this litigation?
218	Denn is on trial for arson. In its case in chief, the prosecution offers evidence that Denn had secretly obtained duplicate insurance from two companies on the property that burned and that Denn had threatened to kill his ex-wife if she testified for the prosecution. The court should admit evidence of
219	A seller, who was married, entered into a written contract with a buyer to sell the buyer a vacation house, which had been purchased by the seller during his marriage but was held in his name alone. The contract expressly required the seller to provide "good, clear, and marketable title" to the vacation home. The buyer paid the purchase price and was given a deed to the property from the seller. According to the jurisdiction's marital property laws, both husband and wife own an interest in any real property purchased during their marriage. However, another statute provides that when real property is held in the name of one spouse alone, that spouse may convey that real property to another, and any interest in the property owned by the spouse whose name does not appear on the recorded title is terminated, unless that spouse brings an action within one year to set aside the conveyance. Six months later, the seller's wife successfully set aside the conveyance on the ground that the seller had conveyed her marital interest in the vacation home without her consent. What would be the result of an action for damages by the buyer against the seller for breach of the land sale contract?
220	A federal statute with inseverable provisions established a new five-member National Prosperity Board with broad regulatory powers over the operation of the securities, banking, and commodities industries, including the power to issue rules with the force of law. The statute provides for three of the board members to be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. They serve seven-year terms and are removable only for good cause. The other two members of the board were designated in the statute to be the respective general counsel of the Senate and House of Representatives Committees on Government Operations. The statute stipulated that they were to serve on the board for as long as they continued in those positions. Following all required administrative procedures, the board issued an elaborate set of rules regulating the operations of all banks, securities dealers, and commodities brokers. The Green Light Securities Company, which was subject to the board's rules, sought a declaratory judgment that the rules were invalid because the statute establishing the board was unconstitutional. In this case, the court should rule that the statute establishing the National Prosperity Board is
221	Miller is tried for armed robbery of the First Bank of City. On cross-examination of Miller, the prosecutor asks Miller whether he was convicted the previous year of tax fraud. This question is
222	A plaintiff sued a defendant for serious personal injuries he incurred when the defendant allegedly drove through a red light and collided with the plaintiff's car. Calling the defendant as an adverse witness, the plaintiff asked her if she had been drinking before the accident. The defendant refused to answer, asserting her privilege against self-incrimination. The plaintiff then offers in evidence a certified copy of a court record indicating that, eight years previously, the defendant had been convicted of reckless driving while intoxicated that caused serious personal injury, a felony. The trial court should:
223	Pat had been under the care of a cardiologist for three years prior to submitting to an elective operation that was performed by Surgeon. Two days thereafter, Pat suffered a stroke, resulting in a coma, caused by a blood clot that lodged in her brain. When it appeared that she had entered a permanent vegetative state, with no hope of recovery, the artificial life-support system that had been provided was withdrawn, and she died a few hours later. The withdrawal of artificial life support had been requested by her family, and duly approved by a court. Surgeon was not involved in that decision, or in its execution. The administrator of Pat's estate thereafter filed a wrongful death action against Surgeon, claiming that Surgeon was negligent in having failed to consult a cardiologist prior to the operation. At the trial the plaintiff offered evidence that accepted medical practice would require examination of the patient by a cardiologist prior to the type of operation that Surgeon performed. In this action, the plaintiff should
224	On the way home from a nightclub, a passenger began yelling at the designated driver claiming that he was not taking the best route back to her house. The driver disagreed and contended that his route was the quickest. The passenger impulsively grabbed the steering wheel, causing the car to swerve and strike a pedestrian, injuring him. At trial, the pedestrian established that the driver's license had expired the day before the accident. The driver's traffic record qualified him for an automatic renewal of his driver's license, but he had forgotten to submit it in time. A statute in the jurisdiction makes it an offense to drive a vehicle on any public road in the state without a valid driver's license. The pedestrian will:
225	Carr ran into and injured Pedersen, a pedestrian. With Carr in his car were Wanda and Walter Passenger. Passerby saw the accident and called the police department, which sent Sheriff to investigate. All of these people are available as potential witnesses in the case of Pedersen v. Carr. Pedersen alleges that Carr, while drunk, struck Pedersen who was in a duly marked crosswalk. Pedersen's counsel wants to introduce testimony of Sheriff that at the police station Carr told Sheriff, "I think this was probably my fault." The trial judge should rule this testimony
226	Miller is tried for armed robbery of the First Bank of City. At the request of police, the teller who was robbed prepared a sketch bearing a strong likeness to Miller, but the teller died in an automobile accident before Miller was arrested. At trial the prosecution offers the sketch. The sketch is
227	A written contract was entered into between Bouquet, a financier-investor, and Vintage Corporation, a winery and grape-grower. The contract provided that Bouquet would invest $1,000,000 in Vintage for its capital expansion and, in return, that Vintage, from grapes grown in its famous vineyards, would produce and market at least 500,000 bottles of wine each year for five years under the label "Premium Vintage-Bouquet' The contract included provisions that the parties would share equally the profits and losses from the venture and that, if feasible, the wine would be distributed by Vintage only through Claret, a wholesale distributor of fine wines. Neither Bouquet nor Vintage had previously dealt with Claret. Claret learned of the contract two days later from reading a trade newspaper. In reliance thereon, he immediately hired an additional sales executive and contracted for enlargement of his wine storage and display facility. If Vintage refuses to distribute the wine through Claret and Claret then sues Vintage for breach of contract, is it likely that Claret will prevail?
228	In 1956, Silo Cement Company constructed a plant for manufacturing ready-mix concrete in Lakeville. At that time Silo was using bagged cement, which caused little or no dust. In 1970, Petrone bought a home approximately 1,800 feet from the Silo plant. One year ago, Silo stopped using bagged cement and began to receive cement in bulk shipments. Since then at least five truckloads of cement have passed Petrone's house daily. Cement blows off the trucks and into Petrone's house. When the cement arrives at the Silo plant, it is blown by forced air from the trucks into the storage bin. As a consequence cement dust fills the air surrounding the plant to a distance of 2,000 feet. Petrone's house is the only residence within 2,000 feet of the plant. If Petrone asserts a claim against Silo based on nuisance, will Petrone prevail?
229	As a man walked out of a store, he saw a friend under the hood of a car trying to get it started. When the man asked what was wrong, the friend told him that she had lost the keys to her car and was trying to "hotwire" it. The man told his friend to get behind the steering wheel, and when she was ready, the man started the car by "hotwiring" it. In fact, the friend did not own the car, and the man is charged with being an accessory to larceny. The man should be found:
230	A father owned a parcel of land in fee simple. Shortly after his wife died, the father conveyed the land to his sister for life, remainder to the children of his son in fee simple. The son was married but had no children. What interest, if any, is created in favor of the son's unborn children at the time of the conveyance?
231	An attorney was employed by the United States Department of Health and Human Services in a regional office located in a tobaccogrowing state. A labor contract between the agency and the clerical workers union contained a policy providing for termination of union employees only for certain specified grounds. The attorney, however, was not a member of the union and not covered by such a policy. The attorney was angered by the regional director's refusal to adopt a no-smoking policy for employees and visitors in the office. She posted a notice in the employee cafeteria ridiculing what she called the hypocrisy of an agency promoting healthissues and nonsmoking programs while refusing to provide its employees with those same opportunities. The notice prompted a great deal of debate among the employees and was brought to the attention of the regional director, who was very displeased. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the director's right to dismiss the attorney?
232	A woman loaned her car to a friend to use while his car was in the shop for repairs. When the friend's car was repaired, he let his neighbor borrow the woman's car instead of returning it to the woman. The neighbor took the woman's car for several days on a 900-mile trip. While the neighbor was gone on the trip, the woman discovered that the friend had gotten his car repaired and asked him for her car back. She was furious when he told her that he had lent the car to his neighbor. The neighbor eventually returned the car to the friend, who then attempted to return the car to the woman. The woman refused to accept the car even though it was undamaged, and sued the friend for conversion of the car. Which of the following would be the most likely result of this suit?
233	After waiting until all the customers had left, Max entered a small grocery store just before closing time. He went up to the lone clerk in the store and said, "Hand over all the money in the cash register or you will get hurt." The clerk fainted and struck his head on the edge of the counter. As Max went behind the counter to open the cash register, two customers entered the store. Max ran out before he was able to open the register drawer. On this evidence Max could be convicted of
234	Miller is tried for armed robbery of the First Bank of City. The prosecution, in its case in chief, offers evidence that when Miller was arrested one day after the crime, he had a quantity of heroin and a hypodermic needle in his possession. This evidence should be
235	Which of the following questions is most likely to be disallowed in response to an objection that it is leading?
236	A daughter brought suit against an insurer for failure to pay benefits on a policy held by her famous father, who had been missing for years. The insurer had refused to pay because there had been no determination that the father was deceased. At trial, the daughter testifies that she has not heard from her father since prior to New Year's Day seven years ago. On that date, a chartered boat left Florida and has never returned. The ship was last seen near midday on that day sailing into an area known as the "graveyard of ships." No trace of the boat has ever been found. The daughter establishes that the charter operator filed a passenger list with the coast guard, and that one of the names on the list is "Madd Hatter." The daughter wishes to testify that on the day before the disappearance, her father told her that he planned to propose a television pilot for a comedy starring himself as "Madd Hatter." If the insurer's attorney objects, is the testimony as to the father's alleged statement admissible?
237	A homeowner purchased a riding lawn mower from a lawn mower dealer. During his first use of the mower, the homeowner noticed that the mower was vibrating when he turned, but he was able to finish mowing. A few days later, the homeowner lent the mower to his neighbor. The neighbor was driving the mower back to his yard when he made a turn and a wheel broke off, causing the neighbor to be thrown off the lawn mower and onto the sidewalk. The neighbor was injured. The neighbor brought a negligence action against the dealer for his injuries. At trial, the neighbor presented evidence that the wheel broke because of a manufacturing defect. The dealer presented evidence that the homeowner could have discovered the defect after the mower began vibrating when he used it for the first time. In this action, who is likely to prevail?
238	A written contract was entered into between Bouquet, a financier-investor, and Vintage Corporation, a winery and grape-grower. The contract provided that Bouquet would invest $1,000,000 in Vintage for its capital expansion and, in return, that Vintage, from grapes grown in its famous vineyards, would produce and market at least 500,000 bottles of wine each year for five years under the label "Premium Vintage-Bouquet' The contract included provisions that the parties would share equally the profits and losses from the venture and that, if feasible, the wine would be distributed by Vintage only through Claret, a wholesale distributor of fine wines. Neither Bouquet nor Vintage had previously dealt with Claret. Claret learned of the contract two days later from reading a trade newspaper. In reliance thereon, he immediately hired an additional sales executive and contracted for enlargement of his wine storage and display facility. For this question only, assume the following facts. Soon after making its contract with Bouquet, Vintage, without Bouquet's knowledge or assent, sold its vineyards but not its winery to Agribiz, a large agricultural corporation. Under the terms of this sale, Agribiz agreed to sell to Vintage all grapes grown on the land for five years. Agribiz's employees have no experience in wine-grape production, and Agribiz has no reputation in the wine industry as a grape producer or otherwise. The Bouquet-Vintage contract was silent on the matter of Vintage's selling any or all of its business assets. If Bouquet seeks an appropriate judicial remedy against Vintage for entering into the Vintage-Agribiz transaction, is Bouquet likely to prevail?
239	A state statute was struck down by the supreme court of the state on the grounds that it was in conflict with the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution as well as the Equal Protection Clause of the state constitution. Does the United States Supreme Court have jurisdiction to hear an appeal of the state supreme court's decision?
240	During the course of their marriage, a husband told his wife that he stole a famous painting from a federal museum. Six months after the admission, the couple divorced. Shortly after the divorce, the husband was killed in an automobile accident. Later, the wife read in the paper that a man had been charged with the theft of the painting her husband admitted to stealing and was about to be tried in federal district court. She told her friend that the man was probably innocent because the husband told her that he had stolen the painting himself. The friend told several other people what the wife had told her, and eventually the story got back to the defense attorney. The attorney now wants the wife to testify in court to the husband's statement. Can the wife be compelled to testify?
241	A woman and her boyfriend worked together as pickpockets. The woman approached a man from the front to distract him, holding a small camera and asking him to take a picture, while her boyfriend came up from behind with a knife to slice open the back pocket of the man's pants and remove his wallet. The man was drunk and believed that the woman had a gun and was trying to rob him, but he was unaware of the boyfriend behind him. The man reached into his back pocket to hand over his wallet and was cut by the boyfriend's knife as it was slicing through his pocket. The wallet dropped to the ground as the man clutched his hand. The boyfriend picked it up, and he and the woman fled while the man knelt on the ground in pain. The woman was apprehended shortly thereafter and charged with robbery. Should the woman be found guilty?
242	In which of the following situations would Defendant's mistake most likely constitute a defense to the crime charged?
243	Under an aid-to-education statute passed by the state legislature a few years ago, many private schools receive state benefits. One private school receives: (i) free textbooks from the state, (ii) an exemption from state taxes, and (iii) 20% of its operating budget in the form of state grants. The remaining 80% of the school's-budget is covered by tuition fees and by donations from alumni and others. The school is licensed by the state, but the state has no requirement for certification and licensure of teachers in private schools. A teacher was hired to teach history at the school. The teacher was given the standard three-year contract given to teachers in their first stint at the school. In the fall term of his second year, the teacher gave a lecture to his students criticizing the school's use of school uniforms and encouraging the students to organize a protest against the uniform policy. After the speech, the teacher was called to the administrative office by the headmaster and fired on the spot, despite the teacher's protests that he had almost two years left on his contract. The teacher requested a hearing and was told to leave the premises of the school immediately. If the teacher files suit in federal district court alleging that his constitutional rights have been violated, the teacher will:
244	Assume for the purposes of these questions that you are counsel to the state legislative committee that is responsible for real estate laws in your state. The committee wants you to draft a statute governing the recording of deeds that fixes priorities of title, as reflected on the public record, as definitely as possible. Which of the following, divorced from other policy considerations, would best accomplish this particular result?
245	Lester, the owner in fee simple of a small farm consisting of thirty acres of land improved with a house and several outbuildings, leased the same to Tanner for a ten-year period. After two years had expired, the government condemned twenty acres of the property and allocated the compensation award to Lester and Tanner according to their respective interest so taken. It so happened, how. ever, that the twenty acres taken embraced all of the farm's tillable land, leaving only the house, outbuildings, and a small woodlot. There is no applicable statute in the jurisdiction where the property is located nor any provision in the lease relating to condemnation. Tanner quit possession, and Lester brought suit against him to recover rent, Lester will
246	A dog owner lived next door to a day care center. Because he had a large yard and there were no applicable zoning restrictions, he installed a kennel and began training attack dogs to sell to businesses. As soon as he opened the business and posted signs in front advertising the exceptional ferocity of the dogs, some parents who had children enrolled in the day care center became alarmed at the prospect of the dogs right next to the yard where the children played, especially because the children could see and hear the dogs being taught to attack people. Within a few months of the dogs' arrival next door, the owner of the day care lost 10% of her enrollment. If the day care owner brings a nuisance action against the dog owner, what will be the most critical factual issue that the trier of fact must resolve to determine who should prevail?
247	The National Ecological Balance Act prohibits the destruction or removal of any wild animals located on lands owned by the United States without express permission from the Federal Bureau of Land Management. Violators are subject to fines of up to $1,000 per offense. After substantial property damage was inflicted on residents of the state of Arkota by hungry coyotes, the state legislature passed the Coyote Bounty Bill, which offers $25 for each coyote killed or captured within the state. The Kota National Forest, owned by the federal government, is located entirely within the state of Arkota. Many coyotes live in the Kota National Forest. Without seeking permission from the Bureau of Land Management, Hunter shot several coyotes in the Kota National Forest and collected the bounty from the state of Arkota. As a result, he was subsequently tried in federal district court, convicted, and fined $1,000 for violating the National Ecological Balance Act. Hunter appealed his conviction to the United States Court of Appeals. On appeal, the Court of Appeals should hold the National Ecological Balance Act, as applied to Hunter, to be
248	A car owner left her car with the mechanic to have repair work done. After completing the repairs, the mechanic took the car out for a test drive and was involved in an accident that caused damages to the plaintiff. A statute imposes liability on the owner of an automobile for injuries to a third party that are caused by the negligence of any person driving the automobile with the owner's consent. The statute applies to situations of this kind, even if the owner did not specifically authorize the mechanic to test-drive the car. The plaintiff sued the owner and the mechanic jointly for damages arising from the accident. In that action, the owner cross-claims to recover from the mechanic the amount of any payment the owner may be required to make to the plaintiff. The trier of fact determined that the accident was caused solely by negligent driving on the mechanic's part, and that the plaintiff's damages were $ 100,000. In this action, the proper outcome will be that:
249	Zeller contracted in writing to deliver to Baker 100 bushels of wheat on August 1 at $3.50 a bushel. Because his suppliers had not delivered enough wheat to him by that time, Zeller on August 1 had only 95 bushels of wheat with which to fulfill his contract with Baker. If Zeller tenders 95 bushels of wheat to Baker on August 1, and Baker refused to accept or pay for any of the wheat, which of the following best states the legal relationship between Zeller and Baker?
250	Kontractor agreed to build a power plant for a public utility. Subbo agreed with Kontractor to lay the foundation for $200,000. Subbo supplied goods and services worth $150,000, for which Kontractor made progress payments aggregating $100,000 as required by the subcontract. Subbo then breached by refusing unjustifiably to perform further. Kontractor reasonably spent $120,000 to have the work completed by another subcontractor. Subbo sues Kontractor for the reasonable value of benefits conferred, and Kontractor counterclaims for breach of contract. Which of the following should be the court's decision?
251	On March 5, a seller who regularly deals in the sale of drill bits mailed a signed communication to the buyer for a chain of hardware stores, offering to sell to him 500 diamond core drill bits, priced at $300 each. The communication explicitly stated that it was a firm offer. The buyer received the offer on March 7. On March 8, the seller mailed a notice to the buyer revoking his March 5 offer. The buyer received this notice on March 10. On March 11, the buyer e-mailed the seller, stating that he considered the seller to be bound by his offer. The buyer also placed on order "per your offer" for 500 diamond core drill bits. The seller refused to tender delivery of the drill bits, and the buyer sues the seller for breach of contract. The seller defends on the ground that there was no contract because it had revoked its offer. Given these facts, the court probably would hold:
252	A mother's will left her farm to her son and daughter "jointly, as tenants in common." The son and the daughter, having had no interest in farming, had long since moved to a large city about 150 miles from the farm. However, after the mother's death the son decided to move back to the farm. The son rented various parts of the farm to sharecroppers and regularly sent half of any profits from the farm to the daughter. A few years later the daughter died, leaving a will devising all of her property to a friend. The son, however, refuses to pay any of the profits of the farm to the friend and claims an exclusive interest in the farm. If the friend sues the son, how will a court most likely rule?
253	At the trial of the plaintiff's battery action, arising from an incident in which the defendant allegedly bit off the plaintiff's ear, a witness testified that he was taking a shortcut through an alley one morning and heard someone cry "Help!" Rushing around the corner of a building, the witness saw the plaintiff lying on the sidewalk in a pool of blood, with his left ear missing. The defendant was standing nearby. During cross-examination of the witness by the defendant's counsel, the following question was asked: "If you arrived on the scene after the alleged ear biting, how can you possibly know my client is the one who bit off the plaintiff's ear?" The witness responded: "Because I read in the newspaper the next day that another witness to the event told police that he saw the defendant spit the ear out after I left." The defendant moved to have the witness's last remark stricken from the record. If the trial court denies the defendant's motion, that ruling is most strongly supported by which of the following?
254	In lieu of a snack vending machine, a small company put candy bars into a box in the office kitchen. Using the honor system, employees were asked to put a dollar into an envelope in the box if they took out a candy bar. The office manager would periodically take the money collected in the envelope and use it to purchase new candy. One night while cleaning the kitchen, the company's night janitor impulsively took all the money from the envelope. His actions were recorded on the company's newly installed security camera. The janitor later admitted that he took the money to fund illegal dogfights. Which of the following crimes did the janitor commit?
255	Dora, who was eight years old, went to the grocery store with her mother. Dora pushed the grocery cart while her mother put items into it. Dora's mother remained near Dora at all times. Peterson, another customer in the store, noticed Dora pushing the cart in a manner that caused Peterson no concern. A short time later, the cart Dora was pushing struck Peterson in the knee, inflicting serious injury. If Peterson brings an action, based on negligence, against the grocery store, the store's best defense will be that
256	In response to lobbying, Congress passed legislation appropriating $200 million for grantsin-aid to domestic horse liniment manufacturers and providing some degree of protection from foreign competition. However, because of concern about inefficiencies in the industry, the legislation was amended to allow the Secretary of Commerce the authority to deny grants to horse liniment manufacturers who failed to meet certain "management efficiency standards" outlined in the legislation. One liniment manufacturer and a member of the trade association petitioned the Secretary of Commerce for a $15 million grant. This figure equaled the amount it would be entitled to under the legislation, based on the number of its employees, plants, and upon its average production of horse liniment over a 10-year period. The Secretary of Commerce refused to award the funds, because she determined that the liniment manufacturer was making no attempt to improve its management efficiency. The liniment manufacturer filed suit against the Secretary of Commerce, asserting that the power granted to the Secretary was unconstitutional. Is the legislation constitutional?
257	According to a statute of the state of Kiowa, a candidate for state office may have his name placed on the official election ballot only if he files with the appropriate state official a petition containing a specified number of voter signatures. Roderick failed to get his name placed on the state ballot as an independent candidate for governor because he failed to file a petition with the number of voter signatures required by state statute. In a suit against the appropriate state officials in federal district court, Roderick sought an injunction against the petition signature requirement on the ground that it was unconstitutional. Which of the following, if established, constitutes the strongest argument for Roderick?
258	A dairy farmer hired a local company to assemble milking machines that the farmer had purchased. The written contract between the parties provided that the company would assemble and install the milking machines in the farmer's dairy barn within 30 days, in time for the arrival of the additional cows, and the farmer agreed to pay the company $10,000. Three weeks into the job, the company realized that it would lose $2,500 on the job, due to a new wage agreement forced on the company by its employees' union after the contract was executed. The company approached the farmer and told him that the job could not be completed for less than $12,500. After some discussion, the farmer and the company executed an agreement obligating the farmer to pay an additional $2,500 upon completion of the job. The company completed the work on time, but the farmer now refuses to pay the additional $2,500. In a suit by the company against the farmer, which of the following would be the farmer's strongest position?
259	Plaintiff's estate sued Defendant Stores claiming that Guard, one of Defendant's security personnel, wrongfully shot and killed Plaintiff when Plaintiff fled after being accused of shoplifting. Guard was convicted of manslaughter for killing Plaintiff. At his criminal trial Guard, who was no longer working for Defendant, testified that Defendant's security director had instructed him to stop shoplifters "at all costs." Because Guard's criminal conviction is on appeal, he refuses to testify at the civil trial. Plaintiff's estate then offers an authenticated transcript of Guard's criminal trial testimony concerning the instructions of Defendant's security director. This evidence is
260	After their marriage, a wife and husband went for genetic counseling because of a hereditary incurable genetic disease in both of their families. When it was determined that their offspring were certain to inherit the disease, they decided not to have children of their own. The wife went to a doctor to have her fallopian tubes tied to ensure that she would not become pregnant; for religious reasons, abortion was not an option for her. The doctor did not properly perform the surgery. Tests taken after the surgery indicated that it was not successful, but the doctor failed to inform the wife of that fact. Two years later, the wife became pregnant and gave birth to a child who was afflicted with a disabling version of the genetic disease. Furthermore, the pregnancy left the wife partially disabled because of an internal condition that could not have been foreseen by her or her doctor. The wife sues the doctor, seeking to recover the medical expenses of her pregnancy and her pain and suffering during labor, her lost future earnings because of her disability, the future costs of raising her child, and the extraordinary medical expenses to treat her child's disease. Under current law, which element of damages is the wife least certain to recover?
261	The academic dean of a college was well liked and considered a competent scholar and a fine teacher. However, six months after her appointment as dean, she received a certified letter from the provost of the college, summarily dismissing her. No reasons were given in the letter for her dismissal. She had her lawyer contact the provost to discover the basis for her dismissal. Two days later, the lawyer received a letter from the provost stating, in relevant part, "The dean was dismissed from her employment at our college because I received an anonymous telephone call informing me that she had purchased drugs from a student." The provost had, in fact, received such a phone call, but the basis of the statement was untrue, because the dean had never even used illegal drugs, much less bought them from a student. If the dean files suit against the provost for libel:
262	A young couple agreed to break into an elderly woman's house to steal a painting, but they were arrested shortly after they pried open the house's back door. Both were charged with conspiracy to commit larceny, among other crimes. At her trial, the woman testified that she suspected the man of being a thief, that she agreed to the plan in order to catch him, and that she had made an anonymous telephone call to the police alerting them to the crime to enable them to make an arrest "in the act." The jurisdiction follows common law conspiracy rules. As to a charge of conspiracy to commit larceny, if the jury believes the woman, it should find her:
263	The owner of a large parcel of land subdivided it into 20 separate lots. He sold lots 1-19, retaining lot 20 for himself to live on. The deeds for each of the 19 lots sold by the owner contained the following restriction: "All lots within the subdivision shall be used for residential purposes only." The purchasers of lots 1-19 each built residences on their property. The owner lived on lot 20 until his death, when it was sold without any restrictions to a buyer. Subsequently, the buyer sold lot 20 to a grocer, furnishing him with an abstract of title and assuring him that the land was unrestricted. The abstract of title showed that lot 20 was not restricted. The following year, the grocer decided to build a grocery store on lot 20. A homeowner who owned adjoining property in the subdivision informed the grocer of the restriction and told him that he would be unable to build the grocery store. If the homeowner brings suit seeking an injunction against the grocer's building of the grocery store, will she prevail?
264	Tess occupied an apartment in a building owned by Len. She paid rent of $125 in advance each month. During the second month of occupancy, Tess organized the tenants in the building as a tenants' association and the association made demands of Len concerning certain repairs and improvements the tenants wanted. When Tess tendered rent for the third month, Len notified her that rent for the fourth and subsequent months would be $200 per month. Tess protested and pointed out that all other tenants paid rent of $125 per month. Thereupon, Len gave the required statutory notice that the tenancy was being terminated at the end of the third month. By an appropriate proceeding, Tess contests Len's right to terminate. If Tess succeeds, it will be because
265	Green is cited for contempt of the House of Representatives after she refused to answer certain questions posed by a House Committee concerning her acts while serving as a United States Ambassador. A federal statute authorizes the Attorney General to prosecute contempts of Congress. Pursuant to this law, the House directs the Attorney General to begin criminal proceedings against Green. A federal grand jury indicts Green, but the Attorney General refuses to sign the indictment. Which of the following best describes the constitutionality of the Attorney General's action?
266	A city owns and operates a large public auditorium. It leases the auditorium to any group that wishes to use it for a meeting, lecture, concert, or contest. Each user must post a damage deposit and pay rent, which is calculated only for the actual time the building is used by the lessee. Reservations are made on a first-come, first-served basis. A private organization that permits only males to serve in its highest offices rented the auditorium for its national convention. The organization planned to install its new officers at that convention. It broadly publicized the event, inviting members of the general public to attend the installation ceremony at the city auditorium. No statute or administrative rule prohibits the organization from restricting its highest offices to men. An appropriate plaintiff sues the private organization seeking to enjoin it from using the city auditorium for the installation of its new officers. The sole claim of the plaintiff is that the use of this auditorium by the organization for the installation ceremony is unconstitutional because the organization disqualifies women from serving in its highest offices. Will the plaintiff prevail?
267	A woman was jogging along a jogging path. Suddenly, a driver pulled out of an alley perpendicular to the jogging path and failed to stop at a stop sign. He hit her with his car, injuring her. The woman sued the driver. A city code provided that drivers must stop at all stop signs perpendicular to the jogging path. On the basis of which standard of care will the driver be judged?
268	Dan, an eight-year-old, rode his bicycle down his driveway into a busy highway and Driver had to stop her car suddenly to avoid colliding with the bike. Because of the sudden stop, Driver's two-year-old son, Peter, who was sitting on the seat without any restraint, was thrown into the dashboard and injured. Had Peter been properly restrained in a baby car seat, as required by a state safety statute of which his mother was aware, he would not have been injured. In an action brought on Peter's behalf against Dan's parents to recover for Peter's injuries, Peter will
269	A city has a permanent display of passages from various political and religious documents on plaques along the side of its municipal building, including the Declaration of Independence, the Ten Commandments, and the lyrics to the Star Spangled Banner. The city has added the documents over time when they have been donated by various civic groups. Members of a religious organization that worships the planet Mars donated to the city a plaque containing their basic creed and requested that the plaque be displayed along with the other plaques on the side of the municipal building. The city refused to display the plaque, and the organization that donated the plaque brought suit against the city, claiming that its rights to freedom of speech were being violated by the city's refusal to include the plaque along with the others. How should the court rule?
270	Dart is charged with the statutory offense of "knowingly violating a regulation of the State Alcoholic Beverage Control Board" and specifically that he knowingly violated regulation number 345-90 issued by the State Alcoholic Beverage Control Board. That regulation prohibits the sale of alcoholic beverages to any person under the age of 18 and also prohibits the sale of any alcoholic beverage to a person over the age of 17 and under the age of 22 without the presentation of such person's driver's license or other identification showing the age of the purchaser to be 18 or older. The evidence showed that Dart was a bartender in a tavern and sold a bottle of beer to a person who was 17 years old and that Dart did not ask for or see the purchaser's driver's license or any other identification. Which of the following, if found by the jury, would be of the most help to Dart?
271	Damson was short of money. He decided to go into Winston's house to take Winston's silverware and then to sell it. That night, while Winston was away, Damson entered by picking the lock on the front door. He picked up a chest of silverware from the dining room and went out the front door of the house to his car. As he was putting the chest of silverware into the trunk, he had second thoughts and decided that he did not wish to become a thief. He reentered the house and replaced the chest of silverware where he had found it. As he came out of the house the second time, he was arrested by the police, who had been called by a neighbor. Damson is
272	A group of children, ranging in age from 8 to 15, regularly played football on the common area of an apartment complex owned by O'Neill. Most of the children lived in the apartment complex, but some lived elsewhere. O'Neill knew that the children played on the common area and had not objected. Peter, a 13-year-old who did not live in the apartment complex, fell over a sprinkler head while running for a pass and broke his leg. Although Peter had played football on the common area before, he had never noticed the sprinkler heads, which protruded one inch above the ground and were part of a permanently installed underground sprinkler system. If a claim is asserted on Peter's behalf, Peter will
273	A feed store owner agreed to purchase several tons of grain products at a specified price from a large supplier of cattle feeds. The supplier later failed to deliver the promised grains, and the owner was forced to cover by purchasing from local producers at a higher price. The owner contacted a large law firm in the city and obtained their agreement to represent him in connection with his possible claims against the supplier. Due to error, the applicable statute of limitations period passed without the filing of any action on the owner's behalf. The owner retained another lawyer and sued the large law firm for malpractice. The jurisdiction retains traditional contributory negligence. In addition to the firm's negligence, the owner will also have to establish, as part of his prima facie case, that:
274	A landowner was the owner in fee simple of a tract of land. The landowner conveyed the tract to her neighbor, "for life and then to the first child of my neighbor's only sister who shall reach the age of 21." The sister was unmarried and childless at the time of the conveyance. Five years later, the sister married, and she gave birth to a son the following year. When the son reached the age of 21, he brought an action in ejectment against the neighbor, who is still alive and living on the tract of land. The neighbor's best defense against the son's attempt to eject her is that:
275	A public school teacher was hired without a written contract. The school district handbook provides that all newly hired employees are at-will employees for their first year of service and may be dismissed for any reason or without reason. Six months after being hired, the teacher was dismissed without any prior notice or a hearing. Which of the following, if true, most strongly supports the teacher's argument that she should have been afforded notice and a hearing before dismissal?
276	An equestrian left his horse with a stable while he went on vacation. When he returned, he went to the stable to pick up his horse and was informed by the stable that the bill was $500. The equestrian told the stable that he would have to go home and get more money. The equestrian believed that he was being overcharged by the stable; instead of paying the stable, he arranged to have a neighbor pick up the horse from the stable. The neighbor thought that the stable bill had been paid and the equestrian had a right to the horse; thus, the neighbor took the horse without the stable's knowledge. Halfway to the equestrian's house, the neighbor decided to keep the horse and rode away on it to his own home. Is the neighbor guilty of larceny in taking the horse from the stable?
277	A businesswoman entered into a written contract with a general contractor to build a studio and broadcast transmitter for $3 million by July 1. Among his tasks, the contractor was to install underground cables and fiberoptic lines necessary to broadcast. When digging the deep trench necessary to lay the conduit containing the fiberoptic lines, the contractor encountered a stretch of extremely soggy soil. This was an indication that an offshoot of the nearby city's aquifer underlay the property. This was not indicated on any of the geological survey maps available in the office of the county recorder of deeds. The contractor told the businesswoman that it would cost an additional $50,000 to lay the conduit through that stretch of soil. The businesswoman had already launched an advertising campaign indicating that the station would begin broadcasting on July 4, which was rapidly approaching. Therefore, when the contractor threatened to quit the job without the additional $50,000, the businesswoman reluctantly agreed orally to the contractor's demand as long as he promised that all of the work would be completed by the middle of June. The contractor agreed, proceeded to lay the conduit, and completed building the studio and transmitter by June 15. The businesswoman paid the contractor $3 million, but when the contractor demanded $50,000 more, she refused to pay it. The contractor sues the businesswoman for the $50,000. Who will prevail?
278	On March 1, Computer Programs, Inc. (CP) orally agreed with Holiday Department Store (HDS) to write a set of programs for HDS's computer and to coordinate the programs with HDS's billing methods. A subsequent memo, signed by both parties, provided in its entirety: HDS will pay CP $20,000 in two equal installments within one month of completion if CP is successful in shortening by one-half the processing time for the financial transactions now handled on HDS's Zenon 747 computer; CP to complete by July 1. This agreement may be amended only by a signed writing. On June 6, CP demanded $10,000, saying the job was one-half done. After HDS denied liability, the parties orally agreed that HDS should deposit $20,000 in escrow, pending completion to the satisfaction of HDS's computer systems manager. The escrow deposit was thereupon made. On July 5, CP completed the programs, having used an amount of time in which it could have earned $18,000 had it devoted that time to other jobs. Tests by CP and HDS's computer systems manager then showed that the computer programs, not being perfectly coordinated with HDS's billing methods, cut processing time by only 47%. They would, however, save HDS $12,000 a year. Further, if HDS would spend $5,000 to change its invoice preparation methods, as recommended by CP, the programs would cut processing time by a total of 58%, saving HDS another $8,000 a year. HDS's computer systems manager refused in good faith to certify satisfactory completion. HDS requested the escrow agent to return the $20,000 and asserted that nothing was owed to CP even though HDS continued to use the programs. If HDS denies liability on the ground that CP had orally agreed to coordinate with HDS's methods of accounting, and CP seeks in litigation to bar introduction of that agreement because of the parol evidence rule, HDS's most effective argument is that
279	At the end of the season, the owner of a private beach stacked up his rental canoes onto a trailer, and arranged for them to be moved the next day into a storage shed for the winter. That evening, two nine-year-old boys came onto the owner's property even though they knew that the lake was closed to the public for the season. Both of them had used the canoes (with an adult) several times during the past summer. They unhooked one of the canoes from the rack, lifted it down, and pushed it into the water. Although the life vests were sitting in an open bin nearby, neither boy put one on. When they were out in the middle of the lake with the canoe, they tried to switch seats and caused the canoe to capsize. They both tried to swim to shore. One was able to make it, but unfortunately the other boy could not make it and he drowned. Had he been wearing a life vest, he would have survived. The boy's parents bring a wrongful death action against the beach owner. If the beach owner prevails, it will be because:
280	Loomis, the owner and operator of a small business, encourages "wellness" on the part of his employees and supports various physicalfitness programs to that end. Learning that one of his employees, Graceful, was a dedicated jogger, Loomis promised to pay her a special award of $100 if she could and would run one mile in less than six minutes on the following Saturday. Graceful thanked him, and did in fact run a mile in less than six minutes on the day specified. Shortly thereafter, however, Loomis discovered that for more than a year Graceful had been running at least one mile in less than six minutes every day as a part of her personal fitness program. He refused to pay the $100. In an action by Graceful against Loomis for breach of contract, which of the following best summarizes the probable decision of the court?
281	A plaintiff driving his new sports car was stopped at a red light when he was struck from behind by a truck driven by a driver who had negligently failed to stop. On impact, the door on the driver's side of the car flew open because of a latent defect in the latchthat could not have been detected during the ordinary manufacturing process. The plaintiff, who was not wearing a seat belt, fell out of the open door and was injured. The jurisdiction retains traditional contributory negligence rules; however, evidence of nonuse of a seat belt is not admissible in a civil action. If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the corporation that manufactured the car, will the plaintiff prevail?
282	The federal government owned an old but functional building in a warm southern state. Its furnace was quite outmoded, but because of the building's location, the furnace was used only a few days a year. However, on the days it was used, it emitted a noticeable quantity of smoke and particulate matter. The amount of pollutants exuded into the air on those days exceeded the state's stringent environmental regulations. If the state attempts to enforce its environmental standards and compel compliance by the federal building, who will likely prevail?
283	Homer lived on the second floor of a small convenience store/gas station that he owned. One night he refused to sell Augie a six- pack of beer after hours, saying he could not violate the state laws. Augie became enraged and deliberately drove his car into one of the gasoline pumps, severing it from its base. There was an ensuing explosion causing a ball of fire to go from the underground gasoline tank into the building. As a result, the building burned to the ground and Homer was killed. In a common-law jurisdiction, if Augie is charged with murder and arson, he should be
284	A homeowner contracted with a local builder to build a wooden deck onto the back of her house. The contract called for half of the contract price of $20,000 to be paid to the contractor before he began work and the other half to be paid to him when the job was completed. The contractor began the work but, partway through the job, he got an offer for a rush job that paid better and abruptly quit. The homeowner sues the contractor for specific performance. Will she prevail?
285	A mall leased one of its retail units to a clothing store for a period of five years. The lease agreement provided that the clothing store would pay to the mall, as additional rent, $1,000 a month in maintenance fees for the upkeep of the common areas in the mall. The agreement also permitted assignments and subleases. For four years, the clothing store timely paid all rent and maintenance fees. At the end of the fourth year, the clothing store properly assigned the lease to a discount shoe outlet. At the time it assigned the lease, the clothing store owed $3,000 in maintenance fees for the last three months of its occupancy. The shoe outlet paid its rent but did not pay any maintenance fees to the mall for the first six months. The shoe outlet then abandoned the property. The mall made reasonable efforts during the last six months of the term to relet the unit but was unable to do so. After applying the security deposit to satisfy the balance of the rent, the mall wishes to collect the unpaid maintenance fees for the last 15 months of the lease, totaling $15,000. Who is liable for those fees and in what amount?
286	A defendant was charged with murdering his boss. After obtaining a valid search warrant and executing a valid search of the defendant's office, an officer found a love letter from the defendant's wife to his boss describing their sexual relations. The letter stated, "I can no longer hide my love for you from my husband. I intend to tell him about us and leave him for you." At trial, the officer seeks to testify about the contents of the letter as proof of the defendant's motive for killing his boss. The defense counsel should object on which of the following grounds?
287	Dobbs, while intoxicated, drove his car through a playground crowded with children just to watch the children run to try to get out of his way. His car struck one of the children, killing her instantly. Which of the following is the best theory for finding Dobbs guilty of murder?
288	Ames had painted Bell's house under a contract which called for payment of $2,000. Bell, contending in good faith that the porch had not been painted properly, refused to pay anything.
